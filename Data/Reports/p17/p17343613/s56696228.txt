 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe wedge resection for a lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are much lower, pulmonary vasculature is engorged and mild edema
 is present throughout.  Left suprahilar consolidation is probably a
 combination of hemorrhage and atelectasis.  Apical pleural tube in the left
 hemithorax is in standard placement.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Heart is partially obscured, but probably not enlarged.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:56 p.m., one minute following recognition of the
 findings, which we discussed at 2:00PM.
