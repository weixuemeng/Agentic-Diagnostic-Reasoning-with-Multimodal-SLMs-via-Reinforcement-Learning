                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, dyspnea, question pneumonia, question concerning
 pulmonary nodule.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  There is cardiomegaly, with unfolded aorta.  There is
 patchy opacity at the left lung base with slight obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, progressed slightly compared with earlier the same day (11:53
 a.m.).  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent an early
 infiltrate.  Right and left lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  No right-sided
 effusion.  
 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Focal density
 questioned on the prior study was not specifically delineated.  No focal
 nodule in this area is detected on the current examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible early infiltrate, left base.  Differential diagnosis could include
 some localized atelectasis.
