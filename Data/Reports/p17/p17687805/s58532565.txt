                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is subtle patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, slightly
 more pronounced than on ___. The possibility of an early
 pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded. No frank consolidation. Minimal
 atelectasis at the left base.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged allowing for technique. No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, early opacity at the right cardiophrenic
 region.  Otherwise, no significant interval change. No frank consolidation.
