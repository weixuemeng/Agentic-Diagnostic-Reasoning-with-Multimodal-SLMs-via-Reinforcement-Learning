 THA)     acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest imaging is A radiograph from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very small region of peribronchial infiltration in the right lung all
 projecting over the anterior right fourth rib is probably inflammation around
 a dilated bronchus.
 
 Heart is normal size and there is no pleural abnormality.
 
 There is a very large lobulated lower mediastinal soft tissue abnormality
 centered at the midline.  The most common explanation for this would be a
 hiatus hernia but there is not sufficient gas in a to make that diagnosis, and
 there is some aerated stomach below the diaphragm.  Differential diagnosis
 also includes a large lower esophageal mass, less likely aneurysm given the
 normal contour of the descending thoracic aorta.  Prior chest imaging should
 be obtained to see if there is reason to perform a chest CT to investigate
 this further.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 08:00 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
