                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, POD___ s/p L THA. // Eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to a chest radiograph obtained approximately 5 days prior, no
 significant changes are appreciated. The lungs are fully expanded and clear
 without focal consolidation.  Costophrenic angles not well visualized, but
 likely due to soft tissue attenuation rather than pleural effusions, which
 would be tiny if present.  Heart size is normal. Large, retrocardiac soft
 tissue abnormality mentioned on preoperative chest radiograph remains present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 Previously identified, large, retrocardiac soft tissue abnormality is most
 likely a hiatal hernia, but also on the differential are a large, lower
 esophageal mass or descending thoracic aorta aneurysm.  Recommend correlation
 with prior imaging if available.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend correlation with prior imaging, if available,
 for further evaluation of the retrocardiac soft tissue abnormality.
