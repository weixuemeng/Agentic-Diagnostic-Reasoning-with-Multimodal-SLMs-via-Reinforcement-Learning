                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right atrial and right ventricular pacing/ICD leads are unchanged
 in position.  Tip of endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 4.1
 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for patient rotation.  Apparent
 worsening opacity in the left cardiophrenic angle.  It is difficult to assess
 in the setting of rotation, but most likely represents a combination of
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
