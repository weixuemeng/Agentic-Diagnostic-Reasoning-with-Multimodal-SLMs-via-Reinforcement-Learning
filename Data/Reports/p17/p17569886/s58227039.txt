                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous radiograph.  A left-sided
 AICD/ pacemaker device is again noted with leads in unchanged positions.  Mild
 cardiomegaly with a left ventricular predominance is again seen.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Linear and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Infection in the left lung base however is not
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
