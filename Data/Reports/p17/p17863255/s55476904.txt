                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with prior abnormal x-ray  // assess R lower lobe
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral projections.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance. The bilateral
 hila are normal.
 
 There has been significant improvement of previously seen right lung base
 opacification.  There is minimal residual opacity at the right cardiophrenic
 angle which may represent crowding of normal vascular structures in the
 setting of low lung volumes and poor inspiratory effort combined with basilar
 atelectasis.  There is probable left basilar atelectasis as well.
 
 There are no other new focal lung consolidations.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant improvement in right base opacity. Residual right cardiophrenic
 angle opacity likely represents crowding of vascular structures in conjunction
 with bibasilar atelectasis due to low lung volumes.
