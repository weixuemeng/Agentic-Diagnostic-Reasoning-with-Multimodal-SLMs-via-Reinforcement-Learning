                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left hip replacement with multiple infections, now low O2 sat,
 question developing pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:41 p.m.
 
 Right subclavian PICC line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  Heart size is
 at the upper limits of normal.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is
 suggested.  I suspect the presence of background COPD, with bullous change in
 the right greater than left upper zones, accounting for attenuation of
 vessels.  
 
 There is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, greater than at the
 left base, unchanged compared with ___.   As sugggested on the ___ CT
 scan, the differential includes an infectious infiltrate or focus of
 aspiration.   Small cavitary nodules seen on the ___ CT are difficult to
 appreciate radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Severe background COPD.
 2.  Patchy right-cardiophrenic-greater-than-left-base opacity, is unchanged. 
 The differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate versus changes due
 to aspiration.  
 3. No CHF or effusion.
