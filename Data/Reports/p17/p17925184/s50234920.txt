                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, on prednisone, status post NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:42 p.m.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, a Dobbhoff-type orogastric tube is in
 place, with radiopaque tip overlying the left upper abdomen, presumably over
 the gastric fundus.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
