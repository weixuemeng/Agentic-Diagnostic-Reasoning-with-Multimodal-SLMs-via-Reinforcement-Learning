                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough in a patient with COPD and fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Left lower lobe linear opacity
 most likely reflects atelectasis, although infectious process in this
 location, especially in the very posterior aspect of the left lower lobe
 cannot be excluded.  Lungs are otherwise essentially clear with substantial
 lucencies in the upper lungs consistent with emphysema.  No appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
