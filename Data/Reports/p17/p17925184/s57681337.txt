                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, new tube feeds and
 rales, rule out acute process, aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 15:31 p.m.
 
 A left PICC line is in place, tip over mid/distal SVC.  An enteric tube is
 present -- the radiopaque tip overlies the left hemidiaphragm, presumably
 overlying the upper stomach.  
 
 Compared with the earlier film, increased interstitial markings are seen at
 both lung bases with small bilateral effusions and increased retrocardiac
 density.  Opacity at the left lung may be slightly more pronounced, but is not
 conclusive for new area of aspiration. In fact, the appearance on today's exam
 is similar to that of the ___ radiograph which showed very similar
 opacities at both bases. The upper zones remain clear on today's exam.  Old
 healed right mid clavicular fracture again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacirties are grossly uncnaged. No new infiltrate to
 confirm the presence of new focus of aspiration.
