 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 12:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe COPD, new oxygen desaturation to
 ___% on two liters, tachycardia, question new infiltration.

 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval appearance of a consolidative process in the right lower lobe
 which is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Given the absence of
 peribronchial cuffing, the asymmetric opacity at the right base is not likely
 secondary to pulmonary edema. Stable linear opacity at the left base likely
 represents subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 with emphysematous bullous changes involving the apices.    There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema on the current study.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Results of this examination were phoned to Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 12:56 p.m.
