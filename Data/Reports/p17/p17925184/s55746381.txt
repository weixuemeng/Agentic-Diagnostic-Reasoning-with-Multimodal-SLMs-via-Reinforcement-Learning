                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an abrupt near-complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax with only a small amount of aerated lung at the apex.  Considering
 associated leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal contours, this is most
 consistent with acute left lung collapse, likely due to mucus plugging.  There
 is a known coexisting pleural effusion which is difficult to quantify in the
 setting of complete lung collapse.  Right lung is hyperexpanded, and a
 layering moderate pleural effusion is demonstrated on this semi-upright
 radiograph.  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7.4 cm above the carina, left
 PICC terminates in the superior vena cava, and a feeding tube is directed
 cephalad in the fundus.
