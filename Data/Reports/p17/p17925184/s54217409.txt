                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status with resolving opacities.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right PICC line has been
 removed.  The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.  Hazy
 opacifications are again seen bilaterally at the bases, consistent with
 layering effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases, most prominent on
 the left.  The patchy opacifications seen previously are less prominent,
 suggesting that much of this appearance reflected vascular congestion that is
 resolving.
