                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with COPD on chronic steroids, multiple
 medical problems, including AMS and now with increased shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in upright
 position compared with several preceding chest examinations dated ___ and ___.  Bilateral basal densities most on the right again identified in this
 patient with advanced COPD.  These findings persist, thus possibility of
 multiple aspirations are real.  There is some decrease of hazy diffuse
 densities on the lung bases which raises the possibility of coexisting pleural
 effusions layering in the posterior pleural compartments.  A lateral view not
 included in the previous chest examinations could give answer to this
 question.  On the last preceding chest CT of ___, pleural effusion
 was minimal.
