                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure with likely
 PNA.  // Please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube present, at the level of lower clavicular heads, 7 cm below the
 carina.  NG tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  The mean pulmonary artery and hila both . prominent,
 similar to the prior film.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 There is diffuse vascular plethora, thickening of the minor fissure and
 peribronchial cuffing.  Hazy opacity at both lung bases could reflect
 atelectasis and/or small amount of layering pleural fluid.
 
 Compared with the prior film and allowing for technical differences, the
 overall appearance is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings are similar to the film from 1 day earlier.  The possibility of new
 small superimposed effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 CHF with interstitial and question alveolar edema, similar to the prior film. 
 .
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation again seen.
 
 Cardiomegaly, with apparent prominence of the main pulmonary artery and both
 hila, similar to 1 day earlier.
