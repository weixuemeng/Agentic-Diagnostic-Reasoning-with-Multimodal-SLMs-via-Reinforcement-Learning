                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with c/o SOB.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with secondary bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar
 opacities which are likely secondary to atelectasis.  The lung fields are
 otherwise grossly clear without focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Right shoulder arthroplasty changes are
 noted.  A lap band is seen in the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
