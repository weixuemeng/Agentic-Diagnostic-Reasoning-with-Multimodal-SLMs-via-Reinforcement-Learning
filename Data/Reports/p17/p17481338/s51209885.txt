 Portable upright chest film ___ at 04:10 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  However, given this limitation, the right hilar region
 is prominent raising concern for either prominent pulmonary arteries versus
 lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary edema has improved.  Right hemidiaphragm is
 now elevated and there are streaky opacities at the right base likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
