                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with left VATS biopsy, evaluation for effusion and
 lung expansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes
 with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  A left chest tube has been placed
 in the interim, with resultant decrease in size of left pleural effusion. 
 Airspace opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects reexpansion pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are notable for a
 known anterior mediastinal mass.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval left chest tube placement with decrease in size of left
 pleural effusion and resultant reexpansion edema in the left lower lobe. 
 There is a right moderate pleural effusion remains.
