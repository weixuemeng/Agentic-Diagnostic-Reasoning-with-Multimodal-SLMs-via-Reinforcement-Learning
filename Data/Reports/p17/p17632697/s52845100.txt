                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left VATS mass biopsy, assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are well expanded with unchanged
 small bilateral pleural effusions, including loculated portion along the
 lateral left chest wall. Left basal opacity could reflect preexisting
 abnormalities which were previously obscured by the now drained large pleural
 effusion, residual atelectasis, or alternatively post-procedure hematoma. 
 
 Apically directed left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Prominence of the right paratracheal stripe and AP
 window is in keeping with known mediastinal adenopathy. Cardiac silhouette is
 obscured but unchanged. Distended colonic loops and stomach in the left upper
 quadrant could reflect mild post procedure ileus should not be mistaken for
 free intraperitoneal gas.
