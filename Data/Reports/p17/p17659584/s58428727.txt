                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx sarcoid p/w nausea, weakness and
 hypercalcemia.  // Trend sarcoid progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to ___ chest radiograph, the previously seen
 (right greater than left) interstitial opacities have improved, but are
 relatively similar to the earlier CT of ___.  There is intra
 thoracic lymphadenopathy particularly in the lower right paratracheal and
 bilateral hilar nodes which correlate with findings of ___ chest CT.  The
 heart size is normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  There are no acute bony
 abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right -lung predominant interstitial opacities are likely due to
 asymmetrical involvement of sarcoidosis with associated intrathoracic
 lymphadenopathy.  CT would be more sensitive to determine subtle  interval
 changes in sarcoidosis lung disease.
