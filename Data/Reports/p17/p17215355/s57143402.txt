                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Bacteremia and congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged including moderate cardiomegaly. Increasing opacities are
 noted at the lung bases, greater on the right than left, with a small pleural
 effusion on the right. A mild interstitial abnormality suggest somewhat
 worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild, somewhat increased pulmonary edema. Possible developing
 opacities at the lung bases, greater on the right than left, potential areas
 of coinciding pneumonia. Re-evaluation with short-term follow-up radiographs
 is suggested.
