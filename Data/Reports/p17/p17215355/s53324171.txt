                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic stenosis  // r/o inf, eff
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings, a moderate left pleural effusion, and mild
 pulmonary edema are compatible with volume overload. Increased retrocardiac
 opacification may reflect mildly asymmetric pulmonary edema, but small
 retrocardiac consolidation cannot be excluded. Repeat radiographs following
 diuresis would be useful in excluding possible consolidation if clinically
 feasible. The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evidence of volume overload, small retrocardiac consolidation cannot be
 excluded and repeat radiographs following diuresis would be useful if
 clinically feasible.
