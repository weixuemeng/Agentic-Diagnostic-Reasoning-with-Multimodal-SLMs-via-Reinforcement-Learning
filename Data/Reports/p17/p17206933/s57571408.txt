                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and history of CHF
 with concern for pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since ___, there has been continued progressive consolidation involving
 the left lung with asymmetric opacification distributed throughout the right
 hemithorax most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.  There are superimposed
 areas of bibasilar atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with the
 heart borderline enlarged.  There is tortuosity and atherosclerotic
 calcification within the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased asymmetric opacification involving the left lung
 compatible with worsening multifocal pneumonia.
