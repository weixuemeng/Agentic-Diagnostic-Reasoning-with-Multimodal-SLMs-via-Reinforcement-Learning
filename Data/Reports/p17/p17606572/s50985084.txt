                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased hypoxia, history of CHF  //
 evaluate for consolidation, effusion or edema      evaluate for consolidation,
 effusion or edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly larger and upper lobe pulmonary vascular
 caliber minimally increased, and the mediastinal venous engorgement is stable,
 so the substantial increase in heterogeneous bibasilar opacification cannot be
 easily ascribed to dependent edema a above that may be the case.  Pneumonia
 particularly severe aspiration should be considered.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is new.  No pneumothorax.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective
 positions continuous from the left pectoral generator.  No pneumothorax.
