                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is a very subtle left
 lower lobe parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms.  The opacity is better
 visible on the lateral than on the frontal image.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this opacity is likely to represent pneumonia.  No other
 abnormalities.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 No pleural effusions.
 
 Left pectoral pacemaker.
