                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are stable in appearance.
 Lung volumes remain low.  Slight improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion,
 but worsening atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region with adjacent
 increasing small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacity in the
 right lung base medially has also worsened and likely reflects atelectasis.
