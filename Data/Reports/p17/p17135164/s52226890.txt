                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with end-stage liver disease, hepatocarcinoma metastatic
 to the lungs, sepsis with C. diff colitis.  Evaluation of a new endotracheal
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and ___.  Abdominal CT of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 3.3 cm above carina.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 slightly increased since prior exam with dilated azygos vein and pulmonary
 vessels.  This is compatible with biventricular cardiac decompensation, with
 mild pulmonary edema.  There is no significant pleural effusion and there is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 New biventricular decompensation with pulmonary vasculature engorgement and
 mild pulmonary edema.  ET tube is in adequate position.
