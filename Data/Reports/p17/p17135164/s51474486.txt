                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Line, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences of
 the patient.  Dense left lower lobe opacity likely represents a combination of
 atelectasis and small-to-moderate pleural effusion and is unchanged.  Patchy
 opacity at the right base is minimally better.  No new or worsening areas of
 lung opacification.
