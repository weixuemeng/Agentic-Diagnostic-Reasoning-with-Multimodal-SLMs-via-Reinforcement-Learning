 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope and hypotension.  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The patient is
 slightly rotated towards the right.  The lungs are grossly clear given the low
 inspiratory effort.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal
 limits.  There is slight deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet to the
 right, potentially due to underlying thyroid nodular enlargement. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right lateral
 deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet, potentially due to thyroid
 enlargement or nodule.  Thyroid ultrasound can be performed on a nonurgent
 basis to more completely evaluate.
