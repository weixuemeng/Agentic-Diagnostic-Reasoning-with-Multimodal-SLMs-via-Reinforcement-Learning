                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath on BiPAP; evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable frontal radiograph view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The lateral contour of the descending aorta and
 inferior left heart border are indistinct, which may be secondary to technique
 and body habitus as well as low lung volumes with atelectasis; however, focal
 consolidation and pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded in the appropriate
 clinical situation.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size
 appears enlarged, which may in part be secondary to technique.  There is mild
 cardiovascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion and probable mild cardiomegaly.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity, may be atelectasis with low lung volumes and
 secondary to technique/body habitus, but focal consolidation suggesting
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.
