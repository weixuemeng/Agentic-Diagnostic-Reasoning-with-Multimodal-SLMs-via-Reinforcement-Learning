                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with morbid obesity and weakness.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Exam is extremely limited secondary to portable technique
 and patient's body habitus.  There is no definite large confluent
 consolidation.  Lung bases are not well seen, likely due to overlying soft
 tissues although effusions cannot be excluded.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, likely accentuated due to portable technique and lordotic
 positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited portable chest x-ray without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 PA and lateral films performed in the Radiology Department may offer
 additional detail if patient is amenable.
