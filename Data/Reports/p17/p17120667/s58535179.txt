                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated transfer  // Eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 8.7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube with the tip and side
 hole in the esophagus.
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Patchy opacities within the right lower lung and left
 upper lungs, as well as nodular opacities within the right upper lung,
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia, however there are pleural calcifications
 which obscure evaluation of the lung parenchyma.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminates 8.7 cm above the carina, and should be advanced at least
 3 cm.
 2. NG tube with tip and side hole and esophagus, which should also be
 advanced.
 3. Patchy opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, likely representing
 multifocal pneumonia, however this is obscured by overlying pleural
 calcifications.
