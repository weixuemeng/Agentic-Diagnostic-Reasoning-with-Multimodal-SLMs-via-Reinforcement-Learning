                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of muscular dystrophy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, limiting evaluation.  A juxtahilar
 opacity could represent prominent pulmonary vasculature or a potential
 pneumonia or hilar mass.  No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is
 identified.  The heart size is not well evaluated due to positioning and low
 lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: Recommend PA and lateral radiograph when the patient is able for
 further evaluation of the left juxtahilar region.
