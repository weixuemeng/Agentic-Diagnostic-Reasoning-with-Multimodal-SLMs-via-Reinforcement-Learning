                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ at 12:21.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post retraction of PICC line, check
 tip.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:51.
 
 The left lateral chest and costophrenic angle are not included on the study.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 12:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the mid SVC in
 satisfactory position.  The right internal jugular central line continues to
 have its tip in the right atrium.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Endotracheal tube continues to
 have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Relatively low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and likely
 residual perihilar edema.  Left basilar airspace process appears slightly
 worsened and may reflect worsening lower lobe atelectasis.  Pneumonia should
 also be considered.  No large right effusion.  No large pneumothorax on the
 supine film.
