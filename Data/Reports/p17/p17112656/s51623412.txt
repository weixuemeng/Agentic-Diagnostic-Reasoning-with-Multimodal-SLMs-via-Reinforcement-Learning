 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:44 PM
  1. Limited study due to low lung volumes. Right internal jugular central
  venous line appears to be in the right atrium. Retraction by 5 cm is
  recommended.
  2. New opacification of the right lower lobe with silhouetting of the right
  hemidiaphgram. The acute presentation of this finding is suggestive of
  collapse/atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
  3. Left hilar irregularity and left lower lobe opacity again noted.
  
  Continued followup is recommended.
  
  Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 8:30 on
  ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure requiring pressors.
 New line placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at ___
 and ___ at ___.
 
 A single portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 1 cm above the
 carina.  Interval placement of a right internal jugular central line with its
 tip in the right atrium.  Repositioning is advised and a wet reading was
 provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:30 p.m.  Nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with increasing opacification at the right base is
 concerning for right lower lobe collapse versus worsening consolidation.  In
 addition, there are air bronchograms visible at the left base which could
 reflect an evolving aspiration or pneumonia.  A left hilar rounded opacity is
 again seen and unchanged.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
