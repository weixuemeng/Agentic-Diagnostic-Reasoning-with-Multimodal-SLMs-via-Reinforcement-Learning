 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged and within normal limits.  There is minimal
 patchy opacity within the right lung base which could reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse
 sclerosis of the osseous structures is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right lung base.  This could reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.
