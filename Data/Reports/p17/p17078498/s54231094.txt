                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear not significantly changed. 
 Opacification at the right lung base is non-specific but could reflect
 atelectasis or pneumonia, and streaky opacification is also noted in the
 retrocardiac region that is not well assessed.  There is no pneumothorax or
 definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Basilar opacities, greater
 on the right than left with low lung volumes, nonspecific findings.  Although
 pneumonia could be considered, atelectasis could explain the findings.
 
 Short-term followup radiographs are suggested.
