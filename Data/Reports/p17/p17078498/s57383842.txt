 thought in part due to overlying soft tissues and possible atelectasis,
 especially given clear lung bases on CT from the same day.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in
 configuration.  Coronary artery stents are seen.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
