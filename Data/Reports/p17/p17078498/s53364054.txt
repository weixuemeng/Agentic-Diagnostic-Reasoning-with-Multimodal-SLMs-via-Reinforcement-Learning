                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chills, PICC placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the SVC.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis, similar compared to the prior study.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right PICC tip in the SVC.
 
 2. Left basilar atelectasis, not significantly changed compared to the prior
 exam.
