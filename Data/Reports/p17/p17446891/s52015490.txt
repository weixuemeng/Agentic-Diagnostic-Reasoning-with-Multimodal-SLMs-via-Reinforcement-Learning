 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Moderate left pleural effusion is increased
 since ___.  Left basilar opacification may represent compressive
 atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Opacification in the lingula
 appears more prominent on today's study and may represent pneumonia. No
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are stable.  Tiny right
 pleural effusion may be present.
