                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and decreased breath sounds on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is a persistent
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left basilar opacification, which
 may represent atelectasis.  Trace right pleural effusion is also visualized.
 and unchanged  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from prior with continued
 moderate-sized left and trace right pleural effusions and left basilar
 opacity, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, though infection is not
 excluded.
