 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:02 PM
  Increased size and conspicuity of medial right lung base opacity, compatible
  with pneumonia.  Indistinct right costophrenic angle is compatible with a
  small right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis is similar to prior.
  Right abdominal catheter, possibly a biliary drain is in similar position to
  prior. - ___ ___d/w Dr ___ via phone on ___ at 2001pm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A 6-cm diameter relatively homogeneous round opacity in the right
 juxtahilar region appears slightly more confluent than on the ___
 study.  This likely has pleural and parenchymal components.  Moderate-sized
 right pleural effusion is again demonstrated as well as patchy and linear
 opacities at the right base.  Within the left lung, there has been improved
 aeration in the left retrocardiac region with minimal residual linear
 atelectasis remaining.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance
 with persistent tortuosity of thoracic aorta and left ventricular
 configuration of the heart.  Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a
 drainage catheter has been placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Round right juxtahilar opacity, probably a combination of loculated pleural
 fluid and adjacent lung consolidation.  Considering history of pneumonia, CT
 may be helpful to exclude empyema or lung abscess in this region.  
 
 Findings communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at
 8:15 a.m. at the time of discovery.
