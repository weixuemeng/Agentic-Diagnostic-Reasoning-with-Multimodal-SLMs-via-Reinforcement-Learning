                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia.  Assessment for any changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The previously
 seen right juxtahilar opacification is demonstrated on this study and while it
 could possibly represent right lower lobe atelectasis with associated right
 pleural fluid, a right hilar mass is possible.  There is elevation of the
 right lung base.  There is also some left basilar atelectasis which is again
 seen.  Two drainage catheters are unchanged in position overlying the mid
 abdomen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Right juxtahilar opacification is again seen and could possibly
 represent right lower lobe atelectasis and right pleural effusion, however,
 right hilar mass is also possible.  A CT scan of the chest, ideally with
 contrast, is recommended unless the nature of the abnormality is known.  Left
 basilar atelectasis is unchanged.  The upper lungs are clear.
