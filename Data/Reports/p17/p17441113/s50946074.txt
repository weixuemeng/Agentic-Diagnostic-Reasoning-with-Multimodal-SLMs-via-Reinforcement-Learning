                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Slightly better inspiration.  Opacification at the right base is again
 consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.  Streak of
 atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac region.
 
 No definite vascular congestion.  
 
 An acute focal infiltrate would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
