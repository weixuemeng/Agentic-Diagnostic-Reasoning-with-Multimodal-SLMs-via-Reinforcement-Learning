                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Patchy right base
 opacity may relate to combination of effusion and atelectasis, but underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally, left base linear discoid
 atelectasis is seen.  Additional patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is
 seen, could be due to infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  There is a tubular structure/possible drain projecting over the
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. 
 Additional bibasilar opacities could relate to atelectasis, underlying
 infection is not excluded.
