                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ?hemmoptysis x2 weeks  // Assess for lung
 infection/malignancy
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pectus deformity of the lower sternum makes it difficult to determine if there
 is a small region of consolidation in either the retrosternal lingula or, less
 likely, right middle lobe. Routine oblique views may be helpful in making that
 distinction.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal. Even if the finding is not confirmed, given the patient's
 clinical history, CT scanning would seem to be indicated, vertically to detect
 airway abnormalities, such as small endobronchial nodules or bronchiectasis.
 
 Heart size is top-normal, but there are no other findings to suggest cardiac
 decompensation. .
