                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with central line placement- subbclavian. Assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates new left
 subclavian CVL tip within the mid SVC.
 
 Mildly hypoinflated lungs with perihilar interstitial prominence consistent
 with vascular crowding. Stable reticular opacities within the lungs. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Calcification of the left apical pleural
 surface again noted.  No focal opacity. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and
 hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and upper
 abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left subclavian CVL tip within mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Hypoinflated lungs with persistent bilateral reticular opacities
 suggestive of mild interstitial fibrosis.
