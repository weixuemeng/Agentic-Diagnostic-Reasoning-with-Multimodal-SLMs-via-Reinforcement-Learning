                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with emphysema again noted. 
 Indistinctness of the pulmonary vascular markings suggest mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Worsening bilateral upper lobe and left basilar airspace
 opacities are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There may be a trace right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening bilateral upper lobe and left basilar airspace opacities
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace right pleural
 effusion.
 3. Emphysema.
