                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with advanced lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as
 well as CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiac silhouette.
 There is increased opacity of the left upper lobe, with traction upon the
 trachea and left mainstem bronchus, consistent with the patient's known
 neoplasm.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is identified. 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis and a small left effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.   The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.
 2. Opacity of the left upper lobe with traction upon the trachea and left
 mainstem bronchus, consistent with known left upper lobe neoplasm and better
 evaluated on recent CT.
 3. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis and a small amount of
 pleural fluid.
