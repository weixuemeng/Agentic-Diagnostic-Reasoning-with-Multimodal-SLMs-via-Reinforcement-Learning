                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  LORDOTIC POSITIONING.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:14 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.7 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off film.
 A right IJ central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  Right upper
 quadrant surgical clips are noted. 
 
 Low lung volumes. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  Suspect
 slight volume loss on the left, with slight shift of the mediastinum.  There
 is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, consistent with collapse
 and/or consolidation, also unchanged.   Patchy opacity in the right suprahilar
 region is probably also present, but different in appearance compared with the
 ___ film, due to differences in positioning.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but no definite CHF.  No gross effusion.
 
 The previously seen left base catheter is not definitely identified and
 appears to have been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Differences in positioning.  No definite change in bilateral
 areas of collapse and/or consolidation.
