                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Asthma exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits aside from streaky right medial basilar opacities
 that are better appreciated on the lateral view, most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right medial basilar opacification, more suggestive of
 atelectasis than infection.
