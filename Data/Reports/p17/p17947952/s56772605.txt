                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with Alzheimer's, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes,
 likely related to technique.  There is retrocardiac opacity.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The hila
 appear prominent, but unchanged. The mediastinal contours are otherwise
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Limited chest radiograph demonstrates pulmonary vascular engorgement and
 patchy retrocardiac opacity. The possibility of mild CHF and/or a left lower
 lobe pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded. If clinically indcated, PA and
 lateral chest radiographs could help to better assess for a left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
