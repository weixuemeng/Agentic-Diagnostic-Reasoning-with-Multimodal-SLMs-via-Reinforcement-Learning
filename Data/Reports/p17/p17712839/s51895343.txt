                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma, fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation is made to concurrent CT of the torso.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to overlying trauma board.  A right apical opacity
 is seen compatible with known contusions seen on subsequent CT. Trace right
 pneumothorax is not identified. There are multiple right-sided rib fractures
 also better characterized on CT scan.  Left-sided rib fractures are better
 seen as subacute on CT scan.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits for technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known right-sided pulmonary contusion, trace right pneumothorax and right rib
 fractures as seen on CT scan.
