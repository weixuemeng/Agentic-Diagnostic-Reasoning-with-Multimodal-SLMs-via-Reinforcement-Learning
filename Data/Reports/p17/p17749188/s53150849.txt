                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia  // R/O pleural edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, increased retrocardiac opacity has improved
 somewhat, with renewed visualization of the left hemidiaphragm.  Residual
 opacity remains present.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is marked
 cardiomegaly, with unfolding of the aorta, Upper zone redistribution with mild
 vascular engorgement is unchanged.  Patchy opacity at the right base medially
 is similar to the prior film.  Minimal , if any, left pleural fluid.  No gross
 right effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Note is made of surgical clips about the trachea bilaterally at the level of
 thoracic inlet.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Residual retrocardiac opacity persists.
 2. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Upper zone redistribution
 and mild vascular engorgement is unchanged.  No gross effusions are detected.
