                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // fx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  The
 lateral views are suboptimal due the patient's overlying arm.  Given this,
 there may be trace pleural effusions.  Subtle increase in opacity projecting
 over the right hemi thorax as compared the left is felt to most likely be
 technical.  Multiple surgical clips seen projecting over the lower cervical
 region suggest prior thyroidectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal lateral views due to patient's overlapping arm.  Difficult to
 exclude trace pleural effusion.
