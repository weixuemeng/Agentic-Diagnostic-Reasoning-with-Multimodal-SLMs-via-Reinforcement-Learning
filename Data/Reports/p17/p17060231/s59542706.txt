                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for acute process in a patient status post fall, with
 right rib/flank pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right chest port
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction and multiple sternal wires.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal in size.  Opacity at the right lung
 base likely represents a combination of right pleural fluid and atelectasis. 
 No definite focal consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Displaced fractures of right lateral ribs are incompletely characterized
 regarding chronicity, potentially acute.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right base opacity likely represents a combination of right pleural fluid
 and atelectasis.
 2. Displaced fractures of right lateral ribs are incompletely characterized,
 potentially acute.
