                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral effusions and presumed
 non-expanding lung after thoracentesis on right. This is a repeat film to
 evaluate for progression of pneumothorax  // Compare right ptx to earlier cxr
 today for progression.    Compare right ptx to earlier cxr today for
 progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 4:31 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall volume of the moderate right hydro pneumothorax, mostly air, is
 unchanged since ___:30 following right thoracentesis.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion stable. Neither visceral nor parietal pleura and the right hemi
 thorax appears thickened. Air in the right pleural space may have been
 introduced at thoracentesis.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Note is made once again of coronary
 artery and perhaps aortic valvular calcification, although there is no
 evidence of cardiac decompensation.
