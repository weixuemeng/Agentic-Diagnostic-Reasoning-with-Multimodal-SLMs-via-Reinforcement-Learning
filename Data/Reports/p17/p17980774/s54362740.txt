                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large right-sided pleural effusion which is increased. A moderate
 to large left-sided pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Extensive
 atelectasis of each lung bases presumed to coincide. However, apical portions
 of each lung appear within normal limits without edema. Cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are obscured.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large, increased right-sided pleural effusion. Stable moderate to large
 left-sided pleural effusion.
