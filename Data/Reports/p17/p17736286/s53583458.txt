  Subtle 5 mm nodule opacity projecting between the posterior right seventh and
  eighth ribs, not clearly seen on the prior study in could represent a
  pulmonary nodule.  Recommend follow-up chest CT for further assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall with head strike, R chest wall
 tenderness, and bilateral knee abrasions  // ?Hemorrhage or fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  Right middle lobe atelectasis/scarring is
 seen.  There is no definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Projecting between the posterior right seventh and
 eighth ribs is a subtle 5 mm nodular opacity, not clearly seen on the prior
 study.  Loss of height of several thoracic vertebral bodies, not well assessed
 on this study, but likely grossly similar to the prior study.  No definite
 displaced rib fracture, although study is limited in the sensitivity of
 detector such.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle 5 mm nodule opacity projecting between the posterior right seventh and
 eighth ribs, not clearly seen on the prior study in could represent a
 pulmonary nodule.  Recommend follow-up chest CT for further assessment.
 
 No definite displaced rib fracture, although study is limited in the
 sensitivity of detector such.  If clinical concern for rib fracture persists,
 dedicated rib series or chest CT is more sensitive.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT.
