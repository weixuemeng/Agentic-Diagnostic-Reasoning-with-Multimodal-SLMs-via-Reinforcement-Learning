                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely relate to atelectasis.  Patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity most likely related to atelectasis in the appropriate clinical
 setting, and early consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  Multiple, 2 to 3, compression deformitities in the mid thoracic
 spine are stable.
