                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs as well as CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP radiograph is compared to multiple prior studies. Patient
 is status post median sternotomy with wires which appear intact. Clips are
 noted along the left mediastinal and cardiac border.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable. Linear opacity projecting over the left upper lung
 zone corresponds to a focal area of scarring and fibrosis with traction
 bronchiectasis as shown on CT dated ___. Relative to prior chest
 radiograph dated ___, lungs are similar in appearance. 
 Interstitial and airspace opacities may reflect substantial vascular
 congestion.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Interstitial and airspace opacities may
 reflect substantial vascular congestion though superimposed pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Left upper lobe linear
 opacity corresponds to scarring and fibrosis is identified on CT dated ___.
