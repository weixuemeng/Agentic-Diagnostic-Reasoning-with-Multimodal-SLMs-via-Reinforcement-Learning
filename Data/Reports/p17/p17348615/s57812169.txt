                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  New stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. There is patchy posterior basilar opacity depicted on the
 lateral view. It is not certain to which side it may refer, but more likely
 the right lower lobe than left. There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague posterior basilar opacity, probably atelectasis; etiologies such as
 aspiration and infectious bronchopneumonia are not excluded, however. 
 Short-term follow-up radiographs may be appropriate to reassess.
