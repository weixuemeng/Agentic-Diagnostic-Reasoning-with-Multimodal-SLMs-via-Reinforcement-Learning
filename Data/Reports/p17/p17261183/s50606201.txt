                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A stimulator device again projects over the left hemithorax.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged. The aortic arch shows patchy calcification.  There is a
 moderate interstitial abnormality most consistent with congestive heart
 failure.  In addition there is a slightly bulging posterior basilar opacity
 better depicted on the lateral view likely localizing to the left lower lobe. 
 This, for the most part, probably represents a pleural effusion but coinciding
 atelectasis or pneumonia is not excluded by this examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Posterior basilar opacity, probably in the left lower lobe, suggesting a
 pleural effusion with atelectasis; however pneumonia not excluded.
 
 Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful, preferably with PA and
 lateral technique, if feasible.
