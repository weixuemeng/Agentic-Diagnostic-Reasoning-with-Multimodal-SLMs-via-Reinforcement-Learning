                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  There is tortuosity of the aorta.  A subtle opacity
 is identified along the right mid lung adjacent to the minor fissure on the
 frontal view, and overlying the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view. There
 is re-demonstration of a stable 4 mm rounded density in the right lower lung,
 likely representative of a granuloma. There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax. There is kyphosis of the thoracic spine. Note is made of a
 deformity along the right clavicle, likely related to a healing fracture. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right upper lobe anterior segment opacity adjacent to the
 minor fissure, possibly due to early/focal pneumonia. Followup chest
 radiograph is recommended in four to six weeks to document interval resolution
 following antibiotic therapy. If this lesion persists, however, further
 clinical evaluation is recommended with a chest CT.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___, Dr. ___ ___
 assistant, by Dr. ___ via telephone on ___ at 2:40 p.m., at
 time of the discovery.
