                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously described opacity in the right mid lung is no longer
 evident.  A small dense nodular opacity at the right lung base is unchanged,
 probably a granuloma.  Remainder of lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of right mid lung opacity, which may have been due to
 a localized pneumonia.
