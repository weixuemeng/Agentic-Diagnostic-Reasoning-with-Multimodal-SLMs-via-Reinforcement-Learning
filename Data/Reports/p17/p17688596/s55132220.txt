                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pathologic fracture, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
