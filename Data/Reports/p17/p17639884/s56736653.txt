                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chest pain, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities
 identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No mediastinal abnormalities are
 seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Mildly accentuated
 kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine as seen on the lateral view is
 related to a mild anterior wedge-shaped deformity of a vertebral body in the
 mid portion of the thoracic spine, probably T7.  No other skeletal
 abnormalities are identified.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 available PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The findings
 are completely unchanged.  Thus, no evidence of reoccurring apical
 pneumothorax.  Also, the mild deformity of a mid thoracic spine vertebral body
 appears unchanged.
 
 Review is extended to two preceding chest examination of ___ and
 the diagnosis of a tiny apical pneumothorax made at that time is questionable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Normal chest findings.
