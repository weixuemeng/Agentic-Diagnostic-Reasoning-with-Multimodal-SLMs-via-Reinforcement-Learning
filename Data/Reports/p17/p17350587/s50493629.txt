                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded,
 and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine with osteophytic spurring.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with retrocardiac streaky opacity possibly reflecting
 atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded.
