                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including
 marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is probably at the upper
 limits of normal size.  Streaky opacity in the left mid lung suggests minor
 atelectasis.  The lung volumes are low.  Otherwise, within the limitations of
 technique, the lungs are probably clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
