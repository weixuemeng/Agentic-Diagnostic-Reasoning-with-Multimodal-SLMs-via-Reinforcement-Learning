                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath,
 wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes and some degree of vascular markings.  Given this, perihilar
 opacities and prominence of the central vasculature suggest pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  There is mild lingular linear atelectasis/scarring.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Opacity at the medial right lung base could
 be due to accentuation of vascular markings due to low lung volumes, although
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable since the prior study given differences in inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The
 right base opacity could relate to prominence of vasculature given low lung
 volumes, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Areas of
 atelectasis.
