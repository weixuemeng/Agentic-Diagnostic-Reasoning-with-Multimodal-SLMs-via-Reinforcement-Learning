                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumothorax on the right status post
 chest tube placement.  Patient now presenting with cough.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___ and PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle and minimal opacity at the right lung base, which may reflect pleural
 parenchymal thickening/scarring given the recent intervention.  However,
 pneumonia is also possibility in the appropriate clinical setting.  Minimal
 amount of fluid is seen layering within the minor fissure.  The right upper
 lung is clear.  The left lung is entirely clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is noted. Multiple right sided rib fractures are
 re-demonstrated. No pneumothorax. Resolution of previously noted
 pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity.  Findings may reflect pleural
 parenchymal scarring given recent pneumothorax and intervention at that site. 
 However, an acute pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting. Small right pleural effusion.
