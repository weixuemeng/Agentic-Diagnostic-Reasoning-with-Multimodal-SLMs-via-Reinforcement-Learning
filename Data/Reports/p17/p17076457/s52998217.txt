                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea.  Please evaluate for NG
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left-sided subclavian line, which appears to terminate
 in the mid SVC.  There is an enteric tube with the tip likely in the antrum of
 the stomach.  The lung volumes are low; however, there appears to be
 opacification of the left lung base, likely secondary to atelectasis.  Note is
 made of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in
 antrum of the stomach.
