                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, chest pain, elevated troponin/BNP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  Mediastinal contour
 is grossly unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low.  There is mild pulmonary edema
 demonstrated with peribronchial cuffing and vascular indistinctness.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases as well as within the periphery of both lungs may
 reflect an underlying mild chronic interstitial lung disease with superimposed
 patchy atelectasis at the lung bases, but infection is not excluded.  There
 may be a small bilateral pleural effusions, but no pneumothorax is detected. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  More
 focal opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis or infection
 superimposed on a background of mild chronic interstitial lung disease.
