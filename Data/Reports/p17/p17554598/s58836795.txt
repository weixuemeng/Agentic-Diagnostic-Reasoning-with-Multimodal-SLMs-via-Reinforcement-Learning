 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and lung collapse status post bronchoscopy, to assess for
 pneumothorax.

 opacifications, especially on the right.  This is consistent with diffuse
 pneumonia, probably complicated with some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure and bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right.
