                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup left lung collapse with large left lung mucous
 plug.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies performed ___.
 
 There is persistent collapse of the left upper lobe with improved aeration of
 the left lower lobe.  Multifocal opacities remain in the left lower lobe. 
 Cardiomegaly cannot be evaluated.  Right middle lobe collapse is better seen
 in prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
