 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and sepsis, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been dramatic
 opacification of the left hemithorax. This suggests collapse of the left lung
 related to mucus plug, though some element of fluid within the pleural space
 could be considered.  The right lung remains essentially clear.  
 
 A subsequent image was obtained prior to this study being dictated.
