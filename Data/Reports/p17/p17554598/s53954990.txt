                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung whiteout, to assess after chest physical therapy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 essentially no change.  After pulmonary therapy, there is still complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax.  Again this is consistent with some
 combination of left lung atelectasis and pleural fluid.
