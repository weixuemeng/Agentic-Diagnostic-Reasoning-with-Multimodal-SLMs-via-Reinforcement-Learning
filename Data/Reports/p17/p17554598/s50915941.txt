                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates diffuse calcifications.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted, though no overt pulmonary edema is visualized. 
 Retrocardiac ill-defined opacity is present with small left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax is identified though evaluation of the lung apices is limited
 due to patient positioning and the patient's chin obscuring the left lung
 apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity which could reflect
 aspiration or infection with a small left pleural effusion.
