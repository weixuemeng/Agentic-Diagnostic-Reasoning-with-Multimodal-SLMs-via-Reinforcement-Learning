                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Dyspnea, question COPD.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is a faint opacity in the right upper lobe
 seen in the frontal view, not visualized in the lateral view, might represent
 an early infectious process.  Linear opacities in the left base are consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is mild bibasilar bronchial wall thickening.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is a probably hiatal hernia. 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated suggesting COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with bronchitis, more focal opacity in the
 right upper lobe could correspond to an early infectious process/pneumonia.
