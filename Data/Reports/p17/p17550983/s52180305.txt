                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bleach ingestion, concern for esophageal
 erosion, evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  The endotracheal
 tube is in the mid trachea, approximately 3.2 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm within the stomach. Support device overlies
 the lung fields, obscuring view. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumomediastinum to suggest esophageal
 perforation, although please note that this study is not the most sensitive
 for evaluation of this entity.
