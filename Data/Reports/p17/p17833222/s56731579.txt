                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 733  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax, followup.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 734 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right pigtail pleural catheter is again seen at the apex.  A tiny right
 apical pneumothorax is stable.  There is streaky patchy opacity in the right
 upper and lower lung as well as at the left lung base in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  This most likely represents patchy atelectasis, although an
 evolving pneumonia should also be considered.  No large effusions.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
