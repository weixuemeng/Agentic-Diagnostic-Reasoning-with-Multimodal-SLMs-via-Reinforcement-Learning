 INDICATION:  Chest tube placed on waterseal, here to evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 12:22 p.m.
 approximately one hour earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right apical pleural pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.
 There is tiny right apical pneumothorax visualized on the current study.  The
 lung volumes are slightly improved from one hour earlier with minimally
 improved aeration.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Improved lung volumes and
 aeration from one hour earlier.
