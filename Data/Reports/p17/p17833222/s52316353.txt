                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 16:55
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax status post procedure
 followup of film.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13:43.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 16:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right apical pigtail pleural catheter remains in position.  There is a
 stable tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain low with streaky
 opacities in right mid-to-lower lung and to a lesser extent on the left, most
 suggestive of atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be
 considered.  No large effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
