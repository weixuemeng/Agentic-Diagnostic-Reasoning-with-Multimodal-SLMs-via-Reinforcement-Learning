                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post pericardial window
 placement, now status post removal of chest tube, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  Previously identified pleural
 drainage tube at right lower base has been removed.  Mild degree of pleural
 blunting is noted.  The right pulmonary parenchyma remains well aerated, but
 the entire right lung is surrounded by a small pleural separation with an
 apically seen up to 2 cm wide pneumothorax.  The mid portion of the chest
 demonstrates an air-fluid level surrounds the aerated lung, indicating the
 presence of a hydropneumothorax.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are
 present.  In the left hemithorax, findings remain unremarkable with an
 unchanged appearance of a linear plate atelectasis in the mid lung field. 
 Position of previously described left internal jugular approach central venous
 line remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small apical pneumothorax with hydropneumothorax level in mid
 chest surrounding rather well aerated lung.
