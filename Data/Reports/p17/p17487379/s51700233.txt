                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer, on chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left -sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Right hilar opacity
 likely reflects the patient's known malignancy.  Small to moderate sized right
 pleural effusion is noted.  Previously demonstrated left pleural effusion has
 resolved.  Multiple scattered nodules within the lungs are again noted,
 including a left lower lobe mass measuring up to 3 centimeters, but better
 seen on the recent CT.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Partially imaged is
 hardware within the right shoulder.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion.  Right hilar opacity likely reflects the
 patient's known malignancy.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases are
 relatively unchanged, better assessed on the recent CT.
