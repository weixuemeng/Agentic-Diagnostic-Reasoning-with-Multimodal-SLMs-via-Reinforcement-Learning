                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer, on chemotherapy. 
 Fever, cough and sputum production.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Right lung base is still elevated by a combination of subpulmonic pleural
 effusion, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no change in
 multiple lung nodules, the largest of which abuts the left heart border, no
 change in small left pleural effusion or region of consolidation in the
 posterior segment of the right upper lobe, probably atelectasis.  Of greater
 concern to me is a slight increase in caliber of the azygos vein, in a patient
 with documented pericardial effusion.  Dr. ___ was paged at 10
 a.m., 1 minute following recognition of the findings which we discussed by
 telephone 2 minutes later.
