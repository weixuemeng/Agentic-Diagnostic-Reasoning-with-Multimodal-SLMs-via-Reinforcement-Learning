                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:54.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is new, terminating approximately 8 cm from the carina, at
 the level of the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube tip is suboptimally
 positioned with the tip terminating above the gastroesophageal junction.  The
 heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.  Left-sided AICD/pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right right
 ventricle.  Worsening bilateral parenchymal opacities predominantly in a
 perihilar distribution are noted with increased confluence, likely reflective
 of pulmonary edema which is moderate to severe.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural
 effusion is re- demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Suboptimal positioning of
 the nasogastric tube with tip terminating just above the gastroesophageal
 junction, and should be advanced.
 
 2. Worsening bilateral predominantly perihilar opacities which are more
 confluent, likely reflective of worsening pulmonary edema.  Small right
 pleural effusion persists.
