 abnormalities in the right hemithorax, but the left heart contour is smaller. 
 The patient has had median sternotomy, and MVR.  Transvenous right atrial
 pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are continuous from the
 left pectoral pacemaker, and unchanged in their positions.  Right PIC line
 ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.
