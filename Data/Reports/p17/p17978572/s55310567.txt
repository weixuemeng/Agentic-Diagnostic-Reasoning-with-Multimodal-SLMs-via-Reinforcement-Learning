                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Question infiltrate or worsening effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  There is also
 a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and ventricle, respectively, as before.  The heart is moderately enlarged. 
 There are new vaguely defined but dense bilateral mid lung opacities which are
 worrisome for multifocal pneumonia, as well as a retrocardiac opacity.  In
 addition, there is new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with an increasing
 pleural effusion, probably of moderate size.  Increasing streaky right basilar
 opacification with volume loss suggesting a component of associated
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia.  Increasing
 right-sided pleural effusion, likely of moderate size with suspected
 atelectasis.
