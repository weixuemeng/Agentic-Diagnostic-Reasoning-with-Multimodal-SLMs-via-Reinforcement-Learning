 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent right
 pleural effusion after right thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates interval substantial decrease in right pleural
 effusion after thoracocentesis.  No definitive pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 Minimal atelectasis is seen adjacent to the pleural effusion in the right lung
 base.  Heart size appears to be unchanged as well as position of the pacemaker
 lead and replaced mitral valve.
