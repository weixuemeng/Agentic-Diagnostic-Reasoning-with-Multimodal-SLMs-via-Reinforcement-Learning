                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspergillus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a substantial
 increase in the ill-defined consolidation in the right mid-to-lower zone,
 consistent with widespread pneumonia.  There is also a large pleural effusion.
 On the lateral view, there is apparent increased opacification posteriorly and
 more superiorly, which could represent another focus in the upper lobe, though
 this is not definitely seen on the frontal view.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  Pacer device remains in good position. 
 The right subclavian PICC line is somewhat difficult to see, but appears to
 extend to the lower SVC.  
 
 This information was telephoned to Dr. ___.
