                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison to the prior chest radiograph from earlier today and CT from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, question residual effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate midline
 sternotomy wires, prosthetic cardiac valve, and AICD in unchanged position. 
 Biliary stent is noted in the right upper quadrant.  Since the prior exam,
 there has been right thoracentesis with only minimal residual right pleural
 effusion.  Ground-glass opacities in the right lower lung could reflect
 re-expansion pulmonary edema versus infection.  There is loculated fluid along
 the minor fissure.  The left lung remains clear.  Heart size is enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval right thoracentesis with only small residual pleural
 effusion, though ground-glass opacity in the right lower lung raises concern
 for re-expansion pulmonary edema versus infection.  Persistent cardiomegaly.
