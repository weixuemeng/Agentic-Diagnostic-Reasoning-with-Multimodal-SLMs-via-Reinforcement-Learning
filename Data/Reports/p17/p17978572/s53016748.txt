                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 single-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and
 cardiac valve replacement.  Small right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis persists.  There is also again right mid lung linear
 atelectasis/scarring, similar to slightly increased as compared to prior. 
 Left lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right
 mid lung opacity appears slightly increased as compared to the prior study and
 may represent a combination of atelectasis and evolving consolidation.
