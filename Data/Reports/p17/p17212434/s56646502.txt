                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and history of renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous with mild aortic knob
 calcifications demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged.
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Known scattered right lung nodules
 compatible with metastases are better seen on the prior chest CT, with the
 largest nodule noted laterally in the right lower lobe measuring 5 mm. Other
 pleural based metastatic lesions of the right hemithorax are better assessed
 on the recent CT. No focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Trace right pleural effusion appears to be
 present.  Destruction of the right 7th rib laterally is re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Known right pulmonary and pleural based metastatic lesions are better depicted
 on the recent CT exam.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise
 identified.  Unchanged osseous metastasis involving the right ___ lateral rib.
