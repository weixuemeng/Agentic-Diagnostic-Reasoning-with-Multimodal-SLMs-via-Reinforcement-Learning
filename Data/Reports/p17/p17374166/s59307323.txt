                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-surgery with tachypnea, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, allowing for the lower lung
 volumes, there still may be mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Pulmonary vascularity, however, appears to be within normal limits.  There is
 opacification at the left base laterally consistent with atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  The right lung is clear.
