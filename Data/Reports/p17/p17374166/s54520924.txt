                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Radical cystectomy, to evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though the
 pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits.  Left basilar
 opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural
 effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.
