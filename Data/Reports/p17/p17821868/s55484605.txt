                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing oxygen requirement postop.  Please evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The NG tube terminates in the stomach and is coiled in the fundus.    The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is not appreciably changed.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly.  Worsening of low lung volumes results in vascular crowding and
 somewhat limits the evaluation, however small bilateral pleural effusions are
 likely present with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.  The hemidiaphragms are
 less well seen.  There is no apical pneumothorax.  Surgical sutures projected
 over the right mid to upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes are worse, and small bilateral pleural effusions are
 likely present with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis made more prominent by the
 low lung volumes.  
 
 2. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
