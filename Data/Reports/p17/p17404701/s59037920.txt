                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient and right lower lobe opacity.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is out
 of view below the diaphragm.  Large right pleural effusion is associated with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe are likely
 due to atelectasis.  There is no evident pneumothorax.
