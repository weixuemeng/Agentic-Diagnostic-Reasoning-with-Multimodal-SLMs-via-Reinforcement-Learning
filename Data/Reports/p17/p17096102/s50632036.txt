                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 6:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, with CHF and sepsis, evaluate for
 interval change and position of the orogastric tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 1:19
 p.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect recti chest film at ___ at 6:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at
 the thoracic inlet.  There are moderate-sized bilateral effusions.  In
 addition, there is increasing airspace opacity in both lungs, right greater
 than left, which most likely reflects asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema,
 although an infectious process should also be considered.  Retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe related
 to the presence of an effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen; however, the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright
 technique.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
