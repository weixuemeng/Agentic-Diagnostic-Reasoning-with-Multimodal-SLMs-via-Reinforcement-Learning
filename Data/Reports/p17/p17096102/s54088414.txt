                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:54 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right lower lobe pneumonia and respiratory
 distress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe global consolidation has worsened dramatically since ___ a.m. on
 ___.  What was previously more pronounced consolidation in the right lung
 particularly the upper lobe is still the case, but consolidation has worsened
 in the remainder of the lungs, now accompanied by substantial pleural
 effusion.  The interval change could be due to cardiogenic edema alone, but
 concurrent pneumonia is likely and I would not be able to detect the onset of
 noncardiogenic edema.  Heart size is only top normal.  No pneumothorax.
