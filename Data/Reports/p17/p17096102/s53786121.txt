 HISTORY:  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Evaluate OG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A feeding tube is seen with its tip in the stomach and would need
 to be advanced at least 7 cm for all the side ports to be past the GE
 junction.
 
 Again seen is bilateral pulmonary edema which is mildly improved from the
 prior study.  Bilateral pleural effusions are largely unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Feeding tube ending in the upper stomach and would need to be
 advanced at least 7 cm for all the side ports to be past the GE junction.
