                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen. 
 There is increased hazy opacity in the right lung.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles is identified as well as more dense retrocardiac opacity
 silhouetting the medial hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 top-normal in size for technique and inspiratory effort.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy opacity throughout the right lung and in the retrocardiac region which
 could represent infection.  Repeat PA and lateral films may help further
 characterize.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles may be due to component of
 effusions.
