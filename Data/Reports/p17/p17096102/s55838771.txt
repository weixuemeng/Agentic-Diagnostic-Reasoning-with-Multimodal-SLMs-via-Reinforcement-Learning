                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged but unchanged.
 The aorta is unfolded.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky
 bibasilar opacities, more so in the retrocardiac region, likely reflect
 atelectasis in this setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation or
 pleural effusion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
