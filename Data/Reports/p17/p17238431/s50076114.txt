                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, pleural effusion and epidural
 abscess  // pleural effusion      pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there has
 been placement of a fusion device with cage in the lower thoracic spine about
 a previously seen wedge fracture.  There are relatively low lung volumes with
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  No evidence of cardiomegaly.  The hemidiaphragms are sharply seen
 and there is no costophrenic angle blunting to suggest pleural effusion,
 though this could well be apparent on a lateral view.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
