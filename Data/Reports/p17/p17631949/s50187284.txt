                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New chest tube with end-aspiration, question tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:49.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube,
 terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina.  A left-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen; its distal aspect not well seen but with catheter likely
 terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  There has also been
 interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below level of the
 diaphragm extending into the left upper quadrant in the presumed location of
 the stomach.  A right-sided chest tube has also been placed in the interval,
 which appears to course inferior to level of the diaphragm.  In the interval
 since the prior study, there has been development of lucency projecting over
 the right inferolateral hemithorax highly worrisome for pneumothorax. 
 Additionally, there has been increase in diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities
 worrisome for worsening aspiration and edema.  Imaging of the upper abdomen
 demonstrates dilated bowel.  There is subcutaneous edema tracking along the
 right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Small right-sided pneumothorax status post right chest tube placement. 
 The chest tube extends to what appears to be inferior to the diaphragm on the
 right, not well assessed.  This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ at
 3:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone, 5 minutes after discovery.
 2.  Appropriate position of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
 3.  Interval severe worsening of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities likely
 representing combination of marked aspiration and possibly pulmonary edema.
 4.  Partially imaged dilated bowel.  CT pending.
