                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chronic respiratory failure with fever
 and increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:54.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 5:13 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There are bilateral airspace opacities with likely layering effusions,
 right greater than left.  Overall, the appearance of the lungs has not
 significantly changed.  Findings could reflect underlying pulmonary
 hemorrhage, pulmonary edema or an infectious process.  Clinical correlation is
 advised and if the patient's clinical symptoms warrant, further imaging with
 CT may be helpful to further elucidate the etiology for this appearance. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A tracheostomy tube
 remains in place.  A more focal calcified nodular opacity is seen in the right
 upper peripheral lung which corresponds to a partially calcified mass seen on
 a CT dated ___, is felt to correspond to a granuloma.  There is a
 suggestion of some bullous emphysematous changes in both apices, which is also
 confirmed on the CT from ___.  Left PICC line is again identified
 terminating in the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.
