                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall. Evaluate for traumatic process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ 13:___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, at 13:45 and allowing for technical
 differences, no significant change is detected. No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Possible atelectasis at left
 base. Heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Upper zone redistribution,
 but no overt CHF, as better seen on the recent CT thoracic spine. No displaced
 rib fracture detected on these lung technique films .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, but no other evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  No significant change compared with film obtained
 earlier the same day. If concern for rib fracture persists, a rib series with
 markers would be recommended.
