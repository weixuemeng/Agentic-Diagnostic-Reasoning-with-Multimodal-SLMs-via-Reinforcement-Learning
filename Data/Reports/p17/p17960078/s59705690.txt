                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a two-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle, as before.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, including moderate tortuosity of the aortic arch and descending
 aorta, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The aorta
 is largely calcified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  The visualized lower thoracic and upper lumbar levels
 show moderate-to-severe, but incompletely characterized degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
