 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device whose leads terminate in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively, as before.  The heart is at the
 upper limits of normal size.  There is moderate unfolding and calcification
 along the thoracic aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Aside from patchy posterior basilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis, the
 lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
