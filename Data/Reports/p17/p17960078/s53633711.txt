                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, CAD.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis, which likely accounts for some increased
 opacity in the lower lobes on the lateral view.  Allowing for technical
 differences, no definite interval change.  No CHF, frank consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.  Dual-lead pacemaker again
 noted.  Additional linear radiodense material -- ? wires -- overlie the left
 lateral chest wall or axilla and were not seen on the ___ radiograph.
