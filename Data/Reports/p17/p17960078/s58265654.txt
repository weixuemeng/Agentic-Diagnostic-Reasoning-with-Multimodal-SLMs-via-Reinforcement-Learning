                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chest pain.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size is unchanged in appearance, mildly enlarged.  Pacemaker leads
 terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs
 are essentially clear with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities
 projecting over the neck, most likely external, correlation with physical
 examination is required.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
