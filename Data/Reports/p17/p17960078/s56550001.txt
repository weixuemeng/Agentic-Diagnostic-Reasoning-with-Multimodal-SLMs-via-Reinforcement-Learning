                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 vascular crowding.  The lungs are clear, there is no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy
 opacities at the left base likely represent atelectasis.  The heart size is
 normal.  Calcifications are again seen within the aortic arch and a left-side
 pacemaker with wires terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
