                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough for four weeks.  History of breast cancer.  Lungs clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no pleural abnormality.  The heart size is normal.  Air in the
 esophagus and very tortuous descending thoracic aorta mimic a hiatus hernia,
 but I do not believe one is present.
