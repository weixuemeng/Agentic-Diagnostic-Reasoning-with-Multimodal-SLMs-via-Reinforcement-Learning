                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p lap hiatal hernia repair with Nissen
 fundoplication  // Eval for PTX, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph, portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dense left retrocardiac opacity most likely represent atelectasis.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The lung apices are not captured on the
 current study, and there may be tiny pneumothoraces, particularly on the
 right.  No sizable pleural effusion on the right.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may represent a small effusion.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Ill-defined lucency projecting over the left superior heart border may
 represent pneumomediastinum.  There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Incompletely evaluated apices, which may contain small pneumothoraces.
 2. Possible pneumomediastinum.
 3. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 4. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is likely postsurgical.
