                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly.  No
 definite focal consolidation.
