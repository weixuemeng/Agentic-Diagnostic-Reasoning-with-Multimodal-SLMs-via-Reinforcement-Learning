                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient status post AVR, MVR with acute hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 8 hours earlier.
 
 Acute worsening in left upper lobe opacity and elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with new left upper collapse.  There are no other
 acute interval changes.
