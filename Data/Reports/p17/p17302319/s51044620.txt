                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right-sided pneumothorax, to assess interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Small right apical pneumothorax and a small
 right pleural effusion, are stable since ___.  Right-sided chest tube is
 unchanged in position terminating in the right basal pleural space. 
 Heterogeneous areas of consolidation in both lungs, predominantly seen in the
 lower lobes, have not significantly changed and likely represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, less likely infection.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Small left pleural effusion and moderate left basal
 atelectasis are unchanged.  A right upper extremity PICC terminates at the
 level of the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax, stable since ___.
 2.  Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, predominant in the lower lobes, likely
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, less likely infection.
