                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of small cell lung cancer with acute
 onset of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable view of the chest.  There are hazy
 bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.  Blunting of the lateral
 costophrenic angles is also seen, potentially due to small effusions.  The
 lungs superiorly are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Degenerative changes
 seen at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar hazy opacities, worse on the right than the left,
 potentially component of atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded. 
 Possible small bilateral effusions.  Please note that repeat with PA and
 lateral would offer additional detail and is suggested when patient is
 amenable, especially given history of prior malignancy.
