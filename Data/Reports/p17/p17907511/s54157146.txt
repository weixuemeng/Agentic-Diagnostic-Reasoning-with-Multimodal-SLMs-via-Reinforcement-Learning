 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, question heart size.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung volumes are
 low with bronchovascular crowding likely accounting for the subtle opacities
 in the lower lungs.  The heart size appears grossly stable and within normal
 limits.  There is a mildly unfolded thoracic aorta.  No focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No signs of pulmonary edema.  The imaged
 bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  Normal-appearing heart size.
