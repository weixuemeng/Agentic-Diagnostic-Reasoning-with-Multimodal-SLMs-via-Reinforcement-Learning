                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female requiring assessment for effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with abdominal radiograph from ___
 and chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Findings are consistent with heart active failure.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is chronic. A moderate right pleural effusion, largely fissural
 best is seen along the costal surface in the lower chest and projected over
 the lower lung, has increased. Pulmonary vasculature is more dilated
 bilaterally than on previous exam and there has been an increase in mild
 pulmonary edema.   The left lower lobe is collapsed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The right IJ line ends in the upper right atrium and would have
 to be 2-3 cm to end in the low SVC.  
 
 A band of hyperlucency across most of the upper abdomen, is more likely due to
 scaphoid abdomen than pneumoperitoneum than, but if there is clinical concern
 for pneumoperitoneum, a fully upright frontal image is recommended to detect
 gas under the diaphragm.  A Dobbhoff tube ends appropriately in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased, mild pulmonary edema and enlarging moderate right
 pleural effusion, largely fissural, probably due to heart failure.  Left
 pleural effusion may be secondary to persistent left lower lobe collapse. 
 Possible pneumoperitoneum versus scaphoid abdomen.  Recommend getting a fully
 upright frontal image if clinical concern exists for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 Dr ___ reported these findings by telephone to ___ at 12:55 p.m.
 on ___.
