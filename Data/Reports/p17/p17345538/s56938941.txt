                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with new dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Lung
 volumes are lower than on the prior study. A new large opacity occupying most
 of the right lower lung with new retrocardiac opacity are likely pulmonary
 edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Supervening infection cannot be
 excluded. Median sternotomy wires are intact, with mediastinal clips. 
 Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by the right opacity. There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema, right worse than left, with bilateral pleural
 effusions. Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment to exclude underlying
 infection.
