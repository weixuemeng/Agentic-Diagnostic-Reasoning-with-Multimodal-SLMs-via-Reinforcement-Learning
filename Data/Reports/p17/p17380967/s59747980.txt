                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is less prominent, though much of this may be due to the upright PA
 view.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  This dichotomy suggests underlying
 cardiomyopathy or possible pericardial effusion.
 
 Single-lead pacer device extends to the region of the apex of the right
 ventricle.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
