                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bronchoscopy, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:40 a.m.
 
 No gross change is appreciated compared with ___ at 8:40 a.m.  Again
 seen is dense opacification, with extensive air bronchograms in the right
 lung, with a relatively small area of sparing at the right lung base and
 possibly also at the right lung apex.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change.  Dense opacification of the right lung.
 The presence of air bronchograms suggests a process filling and opacifying the
 alveoli.  Depending on the clinical scenario, the differential diagnosis could
 include asymmetric pulmonary edema, ARDS, infectious consolidation, or
 hemorrhage.
