  Tracheostomy tube appears to be well positioned, terminating approximately 5.5
  cm above the carina.  NGT can only be seen until the distal esophagus, likely
  secondary to underpenetrated study. Lung volumes are low and cardiomegaly
  stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  There is increased opacity at the right
  lung base obscuring the hemidiaphragm, which may represent increasing
  effusion, atelectasis or underlying pneumonia.  Moderate pulmonary edema is
  present.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy has been
 performed.  The tracheostomy tube appears to be well positioned, the tip
 projects approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is
 visualized only up to the distal esophagus, the lung volumes continue to be
 low and moderate cardiomegaly stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  Moderate pulmonary edema.  Unchanged areas of bilateral basal
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
