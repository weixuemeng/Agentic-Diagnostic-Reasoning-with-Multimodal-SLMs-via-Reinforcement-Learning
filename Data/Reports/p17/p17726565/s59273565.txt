                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:12 A.M., ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with NG tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two views of the upper torso, both excluding lateral aspect of
 the right hemithorax, show initial placement of an upper enteric tube, at
 least as far as the upper mediastinum, but I cannot see the tip.  The second
 examination shows a feeding tube with a wire stylet in place, clearly ending
 in the upper stomach.  Moderate-to-severe mediastinal widening is still
 present, and there now appears to be mild pulmonary edema.  Heart is
 moderately-to-severely enlarged.  ET tube is in standard position.
