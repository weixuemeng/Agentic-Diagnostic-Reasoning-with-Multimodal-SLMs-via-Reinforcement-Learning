                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remains in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent widening
 of right superior mediastinal contours, likely corresponding to a combination
 of prominent mediastinal fat and tortuous vessels as demonstrated on CT neck
 of ___.  Airspace consolidation in the right lung has rapidly
 progressed since the prior study, and is most confluent in the right upper
 lobe and perihilar region.  This may represent a rapidly progressive pneumonia
 given clinical history of pseudomonas infection.  A component of asymmetrical
 pulmonary edema is also possible given the presence of pulmonary vascular
 engorgement and perihilar haziness.  No definite pneumothorax on this
 semi-upright radiograph.
