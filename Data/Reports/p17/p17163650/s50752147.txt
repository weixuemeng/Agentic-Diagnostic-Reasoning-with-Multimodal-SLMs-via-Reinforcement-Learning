                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise relatively unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.
