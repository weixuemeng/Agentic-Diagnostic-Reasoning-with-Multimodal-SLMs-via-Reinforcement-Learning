                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough and rhonchi on left side. 
 Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The previously described mild degree of
 cardiac enlargement persists.  There is no typical configurational
 abnormality; however, the left ventricular contour is relatively prominent. 
 Again noted is an upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution pattern
 indicative of mild pulmonary congestion, but there are no signs of advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema.  Also, the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any pleural effusion.  No discrete local parenchymal
 infiltrates can be identified.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area on
 frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax remain grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with mild cardiac enlargement and mild
 degree of pulmonary congestion, but absence of advanced CHF or acute pulmonary
 infiltrates.  No pleural effusions are seen.
