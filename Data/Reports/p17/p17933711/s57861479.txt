                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  Again, borderline heart size is noted without
 typical configurational abnormality.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic
 aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates a mild upper zone
 redistribution pattern, but there is no evidence of interstitial or alveolar
 edema.  No evidence of acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates is present, and
 the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid
 accumulation.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the
 thorax are unchanged and grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline heart size but stable.  Mild upper zone redistribution
 pattern suggestive of mild chronic pulmonary congestion.  Findings are stable
 and not advanced.  No evidence of acute infiltrates.
