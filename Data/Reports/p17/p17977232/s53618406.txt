                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and cough, assess for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  While no discrete abnormality
 is seen on the frontal view, there is a vague retrocardiac opacity.  On the
 lateral mild increase in opacification of the posterior lower lungs suggests
 left lower lobe pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is top-normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Vague opacity on the lateral view could reflect left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
