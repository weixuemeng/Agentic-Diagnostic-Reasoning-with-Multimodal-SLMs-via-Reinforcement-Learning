                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 bibasilar opacities which are new since the prior study.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Partially imaged is a right-sided VP shunt which extends below
 the right hemidiaphragm but is otherwise not well seen, but likely terminates
 in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities raise concern for pneumonia.  Aspiration is
 also in the differential.
