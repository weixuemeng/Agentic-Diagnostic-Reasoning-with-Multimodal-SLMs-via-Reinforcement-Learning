                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PS, pAF, SND s/p pacemaker // lead
 position, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New transvenous   pacemaker  leads follow the expected courses to the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is  no pneumothorax, mediastinal widening
 or pleural effusion.  A hazy opacity abutting the cardiac apex is larger
 today. Lungs are otherwise clear. Dilated   main pulmonary artery is bigger,
 but, otherwise the cardiac configuration is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New dual lead pacemaker leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  No complications.
   Possible lesion in the lingula.  Recommend correlation with any other chest
 imaging available to see if a clinically significant, lung lesion can be
 excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If no other chest radiographs or CT performed since ___
 are available, consider Chest CT to distinguish benign mediastinal fat
 collection from lung lesion in the lingula.
