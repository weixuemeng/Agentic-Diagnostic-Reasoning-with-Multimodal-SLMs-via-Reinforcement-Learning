                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with syncope.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of the same day
 at 9:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  The heart is mildly enlarged,
 similar to prior.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Small blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle may represent a small pleural effusion or
 scarring.  Previously described 4 mm nodular density at the right apex is
 obscured by an external lead.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to prior and may
 represent small effusion vs scarring.
 2.  Previously described 4 mm right apical nodular density is obscured by an
 external lead.  As before, chest CT should be considered for further
 evaluation.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
