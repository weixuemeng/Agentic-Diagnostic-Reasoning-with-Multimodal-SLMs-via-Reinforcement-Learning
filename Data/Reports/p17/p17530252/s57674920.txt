                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right shoulder and left breast pain.  Evaluate for bony
 abnormality or mass under shoulder.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  The lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax present.  No bony abnormality present.  The right
 glenohumeral joint is barely included within this examination. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Normal study with limited evaluation of right shoulder.  If
 continued concern for right shoulder bony abnormality, recommend dedicated
 right shoulder radiographs.  If continued concern for soft tissue abnormality,
 recommend ultrasound or MRI.
