                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP and upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 views are suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Per the radiology
 technologist, these are the best images obtained; patient was unable to remain
 still.
 
 There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Small right lung base calcified granuloma
 again noted on the frontal view. No focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is slight vascular
 prominence which may be due to mild pulmonary congestion.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
