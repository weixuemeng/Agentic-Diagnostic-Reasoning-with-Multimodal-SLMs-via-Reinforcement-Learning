                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:08 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma and dyspnea.  Question fluid
 overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Although heart size and mediastinal caliber are normal and unchanged,
 pulmonary vascular engorgement in the upper lobes has increased.  This
 suggests that the combination of septal lines and more confluent opacity in
 both lung bases is pulmonary edema.  A concurrent pneumonia is a possibility
 and should be reevaluated after treatment of cardiac decompensation.  Left
 subclavian dual-channel catheter ends in the upper SVC.  Small pleural
 effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
