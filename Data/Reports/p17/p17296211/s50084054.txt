                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p fall sustaining rib fractures, currently
 being treated for UTI and suspicion of pneumonia on prior CXR  // eval ?
 interval changes, worsening effusion or opacities     eval ? interval changes,
 worsening effusion or opacities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is worsening of the diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  Given the enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, much of this could represent pulmonary edema.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to exclude 1 or multiple
 areas of pneumonia.
 Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests pleural fluid and volume
 loss at the left base.
