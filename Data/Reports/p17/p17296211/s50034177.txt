                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with known L PTX and L rib fractures  // size of L
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small left apical pneumothorax.  There is no right pneumothorax. 
 Heterogeneous opacities bilaterally, particularly along the left heart border
 may represent atelectasis or sequela of contusion or potentially edema. 
 Minimally displaced left fifth, sixth, and seventh rib fractures are noted. 
 Right posterior seventh rib fracture is also mildly displaced.  Heart size and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Planning of the left AC joint
 may be chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left fifth, sixth, and seventh rib fractures.  Right posterior seventh rib
 fracture.
 2. Small left apical pneumothorax.
