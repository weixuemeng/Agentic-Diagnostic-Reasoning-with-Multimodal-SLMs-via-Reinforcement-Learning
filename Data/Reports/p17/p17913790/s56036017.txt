                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and neutropenia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Multiple clips are again
 demonstrated within the superior mediastinum and lower neck compatible with
 prior thyroidectomy.  Linear and patchy opacities within both lung bases is
 partially attributable to subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe,
 but infection cannot be completely excluded elsewhere in the lung bases. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, partially attributable to subsegmental
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
