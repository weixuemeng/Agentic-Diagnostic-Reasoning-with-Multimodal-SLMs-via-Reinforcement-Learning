                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain radiating into left arm, question widened
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, there
 is prominence of the interstitial markings, particularly projecting over the
 mild to lower lungs as well as the periphery of the right upper lung, slightly
 more prominent as compared to the prior study.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The mediastinum is not widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the interstitial markings, including at the
 periphery and at the lung bases, similar in distribution as compared to the
 prior study, but slightly more prominent which may be due to chronic lung
 disease, however, superimposed minimal interstitial edema may be present.
