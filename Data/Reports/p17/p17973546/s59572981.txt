                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rising white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing
 opacification in the right upper lobe consistent with the clinical diagnosis
 of pneumonia.  Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence of the mediastinum. 
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and there is continued blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
