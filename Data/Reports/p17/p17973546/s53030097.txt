 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:51 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the
 endotracheal tube is unchanged, with its tip projecting approximately 2.8 cm
 above the carina.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and
 there is retrocardiac atelectasis.  Mild increase in diameter of the pulmonary
 vasculature could suggest mild pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, makes the presence of a small left pleural effusion
 likely.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
