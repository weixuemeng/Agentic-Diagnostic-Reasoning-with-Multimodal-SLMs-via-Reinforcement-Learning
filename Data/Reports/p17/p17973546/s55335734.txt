                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes remain low in comparison to multiple
 prior studies.  Underinflation of the lungs results in prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  A focal opacity in
 the right medial lung base may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia, with mild
 atelectasis in the left lung base also noted. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The osseous structures
 are grossly normal, although evaluation is limited secondary to body habitus. 
 Note is made of gaseous distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes. Focal opacity in the right medial lung base
 could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia, with mild atelectasis in the left lung
 base.
