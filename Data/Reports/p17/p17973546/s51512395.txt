                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with tracheostomy.  Prior film showed failure,
 clinically has pneumonia.
 
 CHEST 
 
 The lung volumes are very low and interpretation of the chest is marginal. 
 The heart remains markedly enlarged.  Failure is likely present.  Some focal
 opacities are seen particularly in the right upper lobe which could represent
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiac enlargement, probable failure.  Possible right
 upper lobe pneumonia.
