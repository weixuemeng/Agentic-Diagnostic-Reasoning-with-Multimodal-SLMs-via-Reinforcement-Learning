 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PVD, and new onset dyspnea  // rule out
 infiltrates/aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing severity of the
 pre-existing pulmonary edema, with increase in extent of bilateral pleural
 effusions.  In turn, this leads to increase of the basal atelectasis seen
 bilaterally.  Low lung volumes and moderate cardiomegaly persist.
