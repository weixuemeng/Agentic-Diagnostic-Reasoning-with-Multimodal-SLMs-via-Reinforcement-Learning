                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size appears moderately enlarged, but is
 accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous.
 There is mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate sized bilateral pleural
 effusions, not substantially changed from the prior exam. Bibasilar opacities
 may reflect compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be completely
 excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. Severe degenerative changes are noted
 in both glenohumeral joints with narrowed acromiohumeral intervals bilaterally
 suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease. No displaced fractures are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
