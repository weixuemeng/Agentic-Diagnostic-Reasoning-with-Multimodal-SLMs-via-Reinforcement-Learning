 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea  // please assess for change in
 infiltrates or new pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously noted airspace opacification which was predominantly in the
 right mid and lower lung zones now also involves the right upper lung zone. 
 The density in the lateral aspect of the right mid lung zone is slightly
 improved.  The cardiomediastinal shadow is unchanged.  There is mild increased
 opacity seen in the medial aspect of the left lung base.  The rest of the left
 lung is clear.  .  Scoliotic changes of the thoracic spine with associated
 chest wall deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Due to the short interval an episode of massive aspiration into the right
 middle/lower lobe is suspected with interval endobronchial dissemination to
 the right upper lobe.
 
 The imaging features do not support pulmonary edema.
