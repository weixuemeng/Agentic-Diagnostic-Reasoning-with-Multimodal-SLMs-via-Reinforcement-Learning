                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aspiration PNA  // eval for interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 Allowing for this, there has been some interval clearing of the retrocardiac
 opacity and of the right base opacity.  As result, the left hemidiaphragm is
 now visible.  Vascular crowding in the right cardiophrenic region is improved.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
