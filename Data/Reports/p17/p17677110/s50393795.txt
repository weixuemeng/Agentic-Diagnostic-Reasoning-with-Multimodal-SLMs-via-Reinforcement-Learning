 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 13:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. 
 Persistent, possibly slightly smaller, left effusion with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac consolidation suggestive of compressive
 atelectasis given the effusion.  Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Streaky opacities at the right base likely reflect atelectasis.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.
