                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic renal cell
 cancer to the lungs and increased work of breathing.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Widespread involvement of the lungs by metastatic disease is redemonstrated
 but no interval development of new consolidations seen.  Heart size is
 enlarged.  The ventricular calcified aneurysm is projecting over the stomach
 bulb which is distended and potentially might increase the work of breathing. 
 No interval pleural effusion development or pneumothorax is seen within the
 limitations of this study where the patient's head is obscuring the lung
 apices.
