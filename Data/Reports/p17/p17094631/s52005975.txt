 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia and pacemaker.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and placement of a
 single-lead pacemaker device.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a
 calcified aneurysm at the left ventricular apex.  A patchy left basilar
 opacity is most suggestive of atelectasis that obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Widespread nodules are extensive in each lung, similar to the
 prior examination.  A pleural effusion cannot be excluded on the left due to
 overlying opacity, but none is identified on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive metastatic disease.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity, although most likely atelectasis.
