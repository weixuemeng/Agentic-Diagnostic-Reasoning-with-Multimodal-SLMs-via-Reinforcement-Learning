                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with AMS  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker/defibrillator is seen with 2 leads in appropriate
 position. Sternotomy wires and vascular clips are projected over the
 mediastinum.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart is
 top-normal in size.  There is a small pleural effusion on the left as well as
 adjacent pulmonary opacities which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 The right lung appears clear except for linear right basilar atelectasis.
 There is no pneumothorax identified.  Left apical thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion. Adjacent lingular and left lower lobe opacities
 could be due to either atelectasis or pneumonia.
 
 Asymmetrical left apical thickening. Consider PA and lateral radiographs for
 further characterization when the patient is clinically able.
