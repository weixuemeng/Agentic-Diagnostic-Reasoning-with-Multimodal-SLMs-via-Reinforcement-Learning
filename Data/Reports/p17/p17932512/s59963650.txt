                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads in unchanged positions within the
 right ventricle. Right PICC tip remains in the mid SVC. The patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG. Cardiac silhouette size remains borderline
 enlarged. The mediastinal contours are similar. There is likely minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Partially loculated moderate size left pleural
 effusion is re- demonstrated with a trace right pleural effusion also similar
 in size.  Increased opacity within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is present.  Left apical
 thickening remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size partially loculated left pleural effusion and trace right
 pleural effusion, unchanged. Worsening opacification in the left lung base,
 potentially atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
