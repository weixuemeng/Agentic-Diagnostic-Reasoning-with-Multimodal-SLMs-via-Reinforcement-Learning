                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and fever to 103, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.  There is subtle opacity obscuring
 the right posterior lung base on the lateral view which could reflect an early
 pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe may represent an early
 pneumonia.
