                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with abdominal pain, status-post NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate an enteric tube
 passing through the esophagus, below the diaphragm into the stomach.  The lung
 fields are low bilaterally, with no evidence of focal pneumonia,  or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac size is mildly enlarged, and there is evidence of
 perihilar bronchial cuffing, likely representing early congestive heart
 failure.  On the lateral view, multiple prominent loops of bowel are seen with
 air-fluid levels, better assessed on concurrent radiographs of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Findings consistent with early CHF.
 2. Nasogastric tube in appropriate position, terminating in the stomach.
