                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cholecystitis, preop for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Lungs are probably slightly hyperinflated.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  Right paratracheal soft tissues are prominent, but likely
 accentuated by lordotic positioning.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is
 identified.  Lucencies surrounding the liver and along the lateral edge of the
 liver and spleen likely reflect some physiologic retroperitoneal fat.
 
 Compared with ___, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly more
 prominent.  The paratracheal soft tissues are slightly more prominent. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible background hyperinflation.  
 2.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.Poor visualization of the cardiac apex likely reflects
 the presence of a fat pad.  
 4.  Prominence of right paratracheal soft tissues could reflect vascular
 structures accentuated by lordotic technique.
