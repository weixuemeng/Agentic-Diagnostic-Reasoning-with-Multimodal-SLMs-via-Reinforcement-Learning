  Left basilar opacity likely due to some combination of pleural effusion with
  possible underlying atelectasis or consolidation, potentially infection.  PA
  and lateral may help evaluate if patient is amenable.  Cardiomegaly likely
  exaggerated by AP technique.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and COPD.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Exam is limited due to portable technique
 and respiratory motion.  There is however left basilar opacity which
 silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged likely due to a
 combination of cardiomegaly and accentuation from technique.  Superiorly the
 lungs are clear and there is no definite right basilar opacity.  Hypertrophic
 changes are noted in the spine.  Possible surgical clips project over the left
 lower chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacity likely due to some combination of pleural effusion with
 possible underlying atelectasis or consolidation, potentially infection.  PA
 and lateral may help evaluate if patient is amenable.  Cardiomegaly likely
 exaggerated by AP technique.
