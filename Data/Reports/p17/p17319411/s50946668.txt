                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and a
 widespread reticulation and ground-glass opacities which may be due to a
 pulmonary edema, opportunistic infection, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Improved
 opacity at left lung base compared to ___ with residual opacity
 likely corresponding to known pleural lesion, better evaluated on recent CT,
 as well as a small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
