 PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  ET
 tube is in a standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid-SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis/consolidations are better seen in concurrent CT.
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has markedly improved.
