                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 HISTORY:  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal,
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Aside from streaky left basilar opacity
 suggesting minor atelectasis, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air is demonstrated.  A partly imaged
 catheter projects over the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with
 a gastrostomy tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for free air or acute cardiopulmonary disease.
