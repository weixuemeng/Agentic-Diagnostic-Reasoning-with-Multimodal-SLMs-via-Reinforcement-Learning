                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AIDS, on Bactrim with left-sided crackles and hypertensive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Previously noted right apical pneumothorax is
 not visualized on the current study.  The left PICC tip remains in unchanged
 position within the upper SVC.  Heart size is normal.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are again noted.  Worsening parenchymal opacities are
 demonstrated in both lungs, with more focal consolidative opacity in the right
 lung base.  No pleural effusion is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening diffuse parenchymal opacities in the lungs concerning for
 worsening PCP.  More focal consolidation in the right lung base may represent
 a secondary pneumonic process.
 2.  Previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is not visualized on the
 current exam.
