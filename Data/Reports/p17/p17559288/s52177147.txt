                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with acute hypoxia.  Known PCP ___. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since the prior examination, there are low lung volumes.  Even accounting for
 decreased lung volumes, there is increased diffuse opacification, more
 prominent within the lower lobes, compatible with worsening disease.  An
 enteric feeding tube is demonstrated coursing below the diaphragm.  There is
 no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing diffuse opacification compatible with continued
 progression of disease.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
