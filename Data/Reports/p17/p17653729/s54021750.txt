                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe collapse, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:57 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Lines and tubes appear similar.  Allowing for
 technique, cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably similar.  There appears to
 be CHF with bilateral effusions, right greater than left, and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.
