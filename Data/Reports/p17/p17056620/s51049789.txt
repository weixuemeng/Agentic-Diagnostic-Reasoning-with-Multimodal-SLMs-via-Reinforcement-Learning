                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia, bullous pemphigoid, possible AMS vs
 baseline  // Rule out evidence of pneumonia or acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral upright chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs and
 flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of COPD.  No focal consolidation is
 identified within the lungs to suggest infectious process.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Retrocardiac density
 may represent a moderate to large hiatal hernia, not appreciated on the prior
 examination.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD. Retrocardiac density may represent a moderate to large hiatal hernia,
 not appreciated on the prior examination.
