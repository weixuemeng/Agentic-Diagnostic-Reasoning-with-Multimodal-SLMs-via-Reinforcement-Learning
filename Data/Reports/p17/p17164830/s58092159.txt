                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo F w/ hx of metastatic breast cancer with lymphangitic
 spread admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and transferred to ICU for
 hypoxic respiratory failure after placement of LIJ port and likely air
 embolus.  // ? interval change in pulmonary edema, ? ET tube placement    ?
 interval change in pulmonary edema, ? ET tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Other monitoring and support devices are
 unchanged.
 Progressive diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, more prominent on the
 left.  Although it is possible that this could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, there is no enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and this process is
 usually more prominent on the right.  Therefore, in addition to pulmonary
 edema, in the appropriate clinical situation serious consideration should be
 given to progressive metastases, widespread pneumonia or even some element of
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
