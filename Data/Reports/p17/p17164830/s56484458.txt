                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with air emboli post-port placement  // ?
 interval improvement in pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube, left pectoral Infuse-A-Port, and NG tube are unchanged
 in position.  Extensive bilateral airspace opacities are similar in extent to
 the most recent radiographs.  Chronic right middle lobe atelectasis is
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the radiographic appearance of severe
 pulmonary hemorrhage, septic emboli, or drug reaction.  The rapid change in
 the abnormality makes worsening metastasis unlikely.
