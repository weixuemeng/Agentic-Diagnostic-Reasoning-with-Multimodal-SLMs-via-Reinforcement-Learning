                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mass-like area of opacity in the right middle lobe has increased in
 size, currently measuring 4.6 x 4.6 cm and previously measuring 4.6 x 2.2 cm.
 It now contains possible cavitation.  Diffuse interstitial opacities have also
 progressed in the interval, and have a mid and lower lung predominance.  Heart
 is not enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance. 
 There are no pleural effusions.  Note is made of previous right mastectomy
 procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Marked worsening of bilateral interstitial opacities, which could reflect
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Differential diagnosis includes non-cardiogenic
 pulmonary edema and atypical pneumonia.
 
 2.  Increased size of mass-like opacity in right middle lobe with possible
 cavitation.  
 
 CT may be helpful for more complete characterization, as communicated by phone
 on the date of discovery.
