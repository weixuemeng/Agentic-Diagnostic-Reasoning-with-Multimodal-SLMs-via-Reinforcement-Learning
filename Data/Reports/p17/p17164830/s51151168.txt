  1.  Endotracheal tube is slightly high at the superior most aspect of the
  clavicles.  Consider advancing 1.5 cm for better positioning.
  2.  Interval increase in bilateral heterogeneous opacities predominantly
  within the left hemi thorax and right lower lobe over 24 hours is worrisome
  flash asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Differential includes infection, drug
  reaction, and/or lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met breast ca, now s/p port placement with
 likely air embolism and intubated in ICU  // ETT in place? evidence of PTX or
 other pulm pathology?     ETT in place? evidence of PTX or other pulm
 pathology?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip in the supraclavicular level, about 5.5 cm
 above the carina.  Nasogastric tube coils within these upper stomach and
 central catheter extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 increased opacification in both mid and lower lung zones, that has worsened
 since the previous study.  This could well reflect pulmonary edema
 superimposed on the known reticulonodular opacification seen on CT that could
 reflect possible infection or lymphangitis carcinomatosis.  Apical scarring
 and fibrosis is again seen.
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
