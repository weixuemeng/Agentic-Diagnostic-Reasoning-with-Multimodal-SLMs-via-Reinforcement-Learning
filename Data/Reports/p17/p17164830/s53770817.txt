                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with breast CA, worsening dyspnea on exertion  // ?
 acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ reference also made to PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Biapical scarring and fibrosis again seen.  Interstitial opacities are seen,
 predominantly on the left, left mid to lower lung, nonspecific in could relate
 to infection, asymmetric edema, or lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Right mid
 lung linear scarring is seen.  Pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are better
 assessed on CT, which is more sensitive.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
