                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hyponatremia, NSTEMI, evaluate for pneumonia and heart
 size.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside hospital chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema is new from
 the prior study.  Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the descending aorta
 are unchanged.  A mild compression fracture of a mid thoracic vertebra is age
 indeterminate.  There is no focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema.  No focal
 consolidation.
 2. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 3. Age indeterminate thoracic vertebral compression fracture.
