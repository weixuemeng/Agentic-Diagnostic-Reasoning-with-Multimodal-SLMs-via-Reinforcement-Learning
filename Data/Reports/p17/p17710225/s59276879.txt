 Since a recent radiograph of 2 days earlier, a right chest tube is been
 removed, with no definite pneumothorax.  Partially loculated right pleural

 atelectasis in the right lung has slightly improved.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 in the right chest wall has nearly resolved.  No other relevant changes.
