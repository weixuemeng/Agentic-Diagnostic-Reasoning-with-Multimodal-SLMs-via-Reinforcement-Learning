                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest and rib radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with atraumatic left lateral rib pain x 2 weeks,
 acutely worsening x2 days.  Assess for left lower lobe process or evidence of
 rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral chest radiograph, two views of the left ribs with
 BB marker citing area of pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are calcified mediastinal lymph nodes likely within the aortico
 pulmonary window, unchanged in appearance since ___.  Stable right apical
 scarring with small apical granuloma is consistent with prior granulomatous
 disease.
 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 The visualized osseous structures are notable for a minimally-displaced left
 lateral tenth rib fracture.  No additional rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimally displaced left lateral tenth rib fracture corresponding to site
 of patient's symptoms.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Evidence of prior granulomatous disease including stable calcified
 mediastinal lymph nodes.
