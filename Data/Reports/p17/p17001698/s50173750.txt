                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two months of dyspnea on exertion and exertional chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low.  There
 are linear opacities at the right base which likely represent atelectasis as
 well as crowding of the pulmonary vasculature due to the low lung volumes. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
