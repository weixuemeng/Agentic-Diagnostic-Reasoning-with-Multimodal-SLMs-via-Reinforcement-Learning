                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malignant pleural effusion and pancreatic cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  There is a similar degree of
 right perihilar opacification but with a change in morphology, probably due to
 atelectasis.  There is a small pleural effusion on the right, but no definite
 pleural effusion on the left, although the posterior costophrenic angle is
 difficult to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion.
