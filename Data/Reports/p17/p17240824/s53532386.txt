 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the right chest tube has
 been removed and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Mild atelectatic changes
 and probable small effusion are again seen on the left.  On the right, there
 again is an area of opacification at the base which, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, it could represent a region of consolidation.
 Cardiac silhouette is stable and there is no evidence of appreciable vascular
 congestion.
