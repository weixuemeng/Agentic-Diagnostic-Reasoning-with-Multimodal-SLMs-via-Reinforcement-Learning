 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains in
 place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Continued low lung volumes
 with increasing opacification at the left base consistent with pleural fluid
 and underlying atelectatic changes.  Area of increased opacification at the
 right base medially does not silhouette the right heart border or
 hemidiaphragm.  This could represent merely atelectatic changes, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
