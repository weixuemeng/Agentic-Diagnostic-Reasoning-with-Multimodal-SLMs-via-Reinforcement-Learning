 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular engorgement, asymmetrical perihilar opacities (right greater than
 left), and widespread interstitial opacities.  Findings are most consistent
 with asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but superimposed secondary process in the
 right lung such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be
 helpful in this regard.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
