                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left-sided rib pain status post assault,
 here to evaluate for rib fracture or evidence of pulmonary contusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time due to the patient's EU
 critical status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are multiple healed rib fractures bilaterally involving the
 right posterolateral seventh-tenth ribs and the left lateral ninth and tenth
 ribs with evidence of callus formation.  There is also evidence of healing of
 a right lateral tenth rib fracture.  No acute displaced rib fractures are
 identified.  There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitium bilaterally,
 suggesting chronic interstitial lung disease, worse on the right compared to
 the left.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The pulmonary vasculature and cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures.  No acute displaced rib fracture
 is detected.
 2.  Prominence of the pulmonary interstitium suggests underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
 3.  No focal consolidation.
