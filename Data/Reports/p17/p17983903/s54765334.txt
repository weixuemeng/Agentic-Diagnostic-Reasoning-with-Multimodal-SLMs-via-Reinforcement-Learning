 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. Right internal jugular
 central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. The endotracheal
 tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Likely small layering effusions with
 increased consolidation in the retrocardiac area which may reflect partial
 lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
