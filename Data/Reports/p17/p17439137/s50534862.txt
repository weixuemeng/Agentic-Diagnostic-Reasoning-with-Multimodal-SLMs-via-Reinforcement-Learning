                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 The heart is markedly enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 
 There are increased insterstitial markings as well as a focal confluent
 opacity in the right lower lung, which may represent CHF with alveolar edema. 
 However, there is no pleural effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy interstitial and some more confluent opacities, worst at
 the right base, without effusions.  Given the presence of severe cardiomegaly,
 this could represent somewhat assymetric CHF, with an element of pulmonary
 edema.  However, focal confluent opacity in the right lower lung makes a
 superimposed infection difficult to exclude.
