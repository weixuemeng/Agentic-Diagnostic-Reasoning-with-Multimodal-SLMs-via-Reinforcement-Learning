                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia  // eval for evolution of
 consolidation/possible cavitation      eval for evolution of
 consolidation/possible cavitation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is opacification
 involving much of the right hemithorax, consistent with the clinical diagnosis
 of widespread pneumonia.  Again, areas of lucency with in the consolidation
 could merely reflect spared lung, though cavitation from necrotizing pneumonia
 could be considered.  A lateral view might be helpful if the condition of the
 patient permits.
