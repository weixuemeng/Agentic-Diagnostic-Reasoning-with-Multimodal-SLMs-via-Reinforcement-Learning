  1.  New consolidation involving the right lung is concerning for infection,
  and warrants followup after treatment to exclude underlying parenchymal
  abnormality.
  
  2.  Area of cystic change in the left perihilar region may be better
  characterized by PA and lateral chest x-ray, when the patient is able to
  tolerate.

  New consolidation involving the right lung is concerning for infection, in the
  correct clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hemoptysis.  SOB/DOE.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, there is a new consolidation, affecting
 the right lung diffusely, with relative sparing at the right lung apex and
 base.  Localization is difficult without a lateral view.   Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. 
 Severe degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint, intact median
 sternotomy wires, and mediastinal clips are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New consolidation involving a substantial portion of the right lung is
 consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, and warrants
 followup radiographs after treatment to ensure resolution.  .
 
 2.  Internal cystic lucencies within the consolidation may reflect areas of
 spared lung, but early cavitation from necrotizing pneumonia is an additional
 consideration.  Consider initial further evaluation with dedicated PA and
 lateral chest radiographs.
