                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness and failure to thrive // Eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate to severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Previously demonstrated
 diffuse alveolar opacities have substantially improved in the interval. Linear
 and increased interstitial opacities within the left perihilar region as well
 as the right lung base may reflect atelectasis or scarring. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. There are extensive degenerative changes of the
 left glenohumeral joint with milder changes noted in the right glenohumeral
 joint. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are also seen within the
 imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked interval improvement in previously noted diffuse alveolar opacities.
 Linear and increased interstitial opacities in the right lung base and left
 perihilar region may reflect atelectasis or scarring. No new focal
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.
