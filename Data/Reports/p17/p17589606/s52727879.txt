                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None Available.
 TECHNIQUE
 PA and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 mediastinal or hilar enlargement is detected.  No CHF, focal infiltrate,
 effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.  Poor visualization of the sternum on the lateral view is
 presumably an artifact due to positioning and overlying soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
