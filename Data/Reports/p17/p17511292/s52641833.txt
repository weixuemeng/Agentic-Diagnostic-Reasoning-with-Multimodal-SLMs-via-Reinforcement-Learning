                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with revision of a right atrial AICD lead, to
 rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A small portion of the left apex
 is not included in the study.  Allowing for this limitation, there is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax.  A left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads
 in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild
 pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right are noted. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.
