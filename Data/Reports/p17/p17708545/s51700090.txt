 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with laceration to neck. Evaluate endotracheal
 and orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated and lying on a trauma board.  The endotracheal tube

 the esophagus, into the stomach, and inferiorly out of the field of view. The
 lungs are clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There
 is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.

 The endotracheal tube could be advanced for more optimal positioning.  No
