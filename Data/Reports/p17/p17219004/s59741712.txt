                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is diffusely calcified. 
 Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities are seen within the
 right lung base which may reflect atelectasis, but aspiration or infection are
 also possibilities.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Marked
 degenerative changes are noted involving the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and patchy right basilar opacity,
 potentially atelectasis though aspiration or infection is not excluded.
