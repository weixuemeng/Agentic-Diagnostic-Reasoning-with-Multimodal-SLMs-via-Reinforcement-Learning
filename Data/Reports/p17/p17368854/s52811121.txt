 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // lung pathology      lung pathology
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ and ___ at 04:57.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant atelectasis persists in the left lower lobe, but probably
 improved, since leftward mediastinal shift is less pronounced.  Atelectasis at
 the right base is mild.  Upper lungs are clear.  Small left pleural effusion
 is present.  The small gas bubble projecting over the cardiac silhouette is
 presumably in the stomach beneath the elevated left hemidiaphragm, but it
 would be good to confirm that with conventional PA and lateral chest
 radiographs as soon as feasible.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs, as soon as
