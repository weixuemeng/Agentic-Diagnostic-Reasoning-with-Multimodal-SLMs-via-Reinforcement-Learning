 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncopal episode, question acute injury to the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Patient's chin
 overlies the superior mediastinum and kyphotic angulation somewhat limits the
 evaluation through the lung bases.  The lungs appear essentially clear without
 discrete consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart size appears top
 normal in size though is poorly assessed.  The mediastinal contour appears
 grossly unremarkable allowing for patient's leftward rotation.  No definite
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
