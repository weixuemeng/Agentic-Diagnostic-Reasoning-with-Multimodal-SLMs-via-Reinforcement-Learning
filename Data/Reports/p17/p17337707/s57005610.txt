                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  IPF with CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is prominence of interstitial markings at the bases, most
 likely reflecting NSIP and better assessed on a recent CT scan.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some basilar atelectatic changes. 
 Dual-channel pacer device remains with leads in good position.
