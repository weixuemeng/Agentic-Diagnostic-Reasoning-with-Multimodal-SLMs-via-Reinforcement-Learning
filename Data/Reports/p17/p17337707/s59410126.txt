                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta is diffusely tortuous and calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Increased
 interstitial markings are noted along the periphery of the lung bases, likely
 reflecting NSIP, and better assessed on the recent chest CT.  Overall, these
 opacities may be slightly progressed, which suggest perhaps that there is
 superimposed atelectasis or infection.  No focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion is visualized.  Lung volumes are reduced.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis, though infection
 is not excluded, superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung
 disease previously characterized as NSIP.
