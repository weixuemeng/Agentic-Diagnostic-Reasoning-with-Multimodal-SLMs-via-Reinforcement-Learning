 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Basilar reticulation suggesting mild interstitial lung disease appears
 unchanged.  Otherwise, lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic
 spine, including small-to-moderate anterior osteophytes.
  
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary fibrosis at the lung bases.  No
 evidence of acute superimposed disease.
