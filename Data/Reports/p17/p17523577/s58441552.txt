                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 There is a subtle 9 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base, at
 the level the anterior left 6th rib, which while may represent overlap of
 vascular structures, underlying pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Evidence of DISH is seen along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. 9 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung which, while may
 represent overlap of vascular structures, pulmonary nodule is not excluded. 
 Recommend oblique radiographs for further evaluation and if finding persists,
 nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.
