 pneumothorax.
 
 Please note that the CT of the chest from ___ demonstrate a
 hypodense  mass adjacent to the left atrium, or an unusually large thrombosed
 left atrial appendage and a large hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Please note that the CT of the chest from ___ demonstrates a
 hypodense mass adjacent to the left atrium, or an unusually large thrombosed
 left atrial appendage.
