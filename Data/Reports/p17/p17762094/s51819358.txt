 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p VATS now with hypoxemic respiratory failure
 // ett placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the patient is now intubated.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube projects at the level of the carinal and needs to be
 pulled back by approximately 2-3 cm to avoid intubation of the right main
 bronchus.
 
 The lung volumes have increased.  The opacities at both the left and the right
 lung base as well as the postoperative opacity in the left upper lung are
 minimally improved. The previously seen deviation of the trachea to the right
 is partly corrected by the endotracheal tube. The patient also has a
 nasogastric tube, the tip projects over the mid to distal parts of the
 stomach.
