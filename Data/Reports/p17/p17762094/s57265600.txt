  1. Moderate pulmonary edema.
  
  2. Right internal jugular central venous line ends in the right atrium, and
  should be pulled back 2-3 cm for positioning in the low SVC.
  
  3. Nasogastric tube ends in the esophagus, and should be advanced prior to
  use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p cvl  // eval for cvl
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Asymmetric opacification in the
 right mid lung may represent pulmonary edema, however aspiration could also be
 considered. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which ends
 approximately 3.3 cm from the carina. Additionally, a right internal jugular
 central venous line has been placed over the interval, with the tip ending in
 the right atrium. Retraction of this line by 2-3 cm low will results in
 positioning in the low SVC.  The nasogastric tube ends in the esophagus, and
 should be advanced prior to use.
 
 Review of the chest radiograph performed after this study reveals improved
 positioning of the right internal jugular central line and persistent
 positioning of the nasogastric tube in the esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Asymmetric opacification in the right midlung may represent edema, however
 aspiration could also be considered.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous line ends in the right atrium, and
 should be pulled back 2-3 cm for positioning in the low SVC.
 
 3.  Nasogastric tube ends in the esophagus, and should be advanced prior to
 use.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Impression 2 and 3 were discussed with Dr. ___ By Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 02:06 on ___, at the time of discovery.
