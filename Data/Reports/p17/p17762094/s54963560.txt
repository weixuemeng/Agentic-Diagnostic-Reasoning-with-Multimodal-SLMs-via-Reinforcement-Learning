                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Increased oxygen requirement - eval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___, and chest
 CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning may artificially change the appearance of the lung base
 pathology. Allowing for this, the opacification of the right lower lung is
 slightly improved compared with ___, and residual right pleural
 effusion is small if present at all. The persistent opacification of the more
 medial right lung base is concerning for consolidation. Retrocardiac
 opacification is increased compared to prior studies, also concerning for a
 focus of consolidation. Taken together, this could represent multifocal
 pneumonia, which is more prominent as pleural effusions recede.  The
 postoperative changes in the left lung apex are unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement right-sided pleural effusion.
 2. Persistent opacification of the medial right lower lung, and increasing
 retrocardiac opacification are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
