  1. Increased tracheal deviation towards right status post thymectomy may be
  partially positional especially given absence of mediastinal widening however
  differential includes mediastinal hematoma.
  2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
  3. Left upper lobe heterogenous opacity consistent with post surgical changes
  and possible hemorrhage post op, unchanged.
  4.  No ptx.
  5.  Increased retrocardiac opacity likely pneumonia however cannot exclude
  pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p robot-assited thymectomy, Left wedge
 resection, with new desaturation  // interval change, pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The
 parenchymal opacities in the left lung apex are constant in appearance. 
 Postoperative tracheal deviation to the right, without obvious increase in
 left paratracheal soft tissue densities.  Minimally increasing areas of
 atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base.  No pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax.
