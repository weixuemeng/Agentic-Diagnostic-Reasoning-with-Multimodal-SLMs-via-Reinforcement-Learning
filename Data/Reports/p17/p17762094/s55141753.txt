                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // pna RLL?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph but an earlier time, a focal area of
 consolidation in the right lower lobe appears slightly more prominent and may
 reflect at developing infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is also a suggestion of a small right pleural effusion. Exam
 is otherwise unchanged since recent study.
