                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiac enlargement is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar with enlargement of the pulmonary artery compatible with chronic
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved
 compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is suggestive of a
 trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple left
 axillary clips are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly improved mild pulmonary edema with persistent severe cardiomegaly. 
 Chronic enlargement of the pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Small right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar patchy opacities,
 likely atelectasis.
