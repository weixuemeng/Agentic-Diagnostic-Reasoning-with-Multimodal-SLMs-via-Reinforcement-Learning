 INDICATION:   ___F with CHF, CAD now with chest pain  // edema? PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ pre
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to AP technique and patient body habitus. Increased
 hazy opacity in lungs is likely due to these reasons although superimposed
 vascular congestion is possible.  Streaky right basilar opacities on the
 frontal view may be due to atelectasis.  There is no large effusion or
 confluent consolidation.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is again noted. 
 Surgical clips project over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette and possible vascular congestion.  No confluent
 consolidation.
