                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia with volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and
 atelectatic changes at the bases.  The streaks of atelectasis at the right
 base are more prominent.  On the left, hemidiaphragm cannot be seen, again
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Lower lung
 volumes may be worsening the overall appearance.
