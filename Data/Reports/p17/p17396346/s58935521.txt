                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, decrased breaths ounds at bases, hx of
 CHF  // evaluate for pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, acute changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relative increase in density over the lower lung fields likely relates at
 least in part to overlying soft tissue although difficult to exclude right
 basilar consolidation. Right middle lobe atelectasis/scarring is again seen.
 No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
 cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is slightly increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Under penetrated lung bases likely at least in part due to overlying soft
 tissue however, difficult to exclude right basilar consolidation.
 
 Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and moderate pulmonary edema.
