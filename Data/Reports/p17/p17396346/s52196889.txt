                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with neck pain and cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate enlarged heart with relative
 increase in density bilaterally over the lower lung fields, minimally
 decreased in conspicuity relative to prior chest radiograph dated ___, likely secondary to overlying soft tissue.    There is mild pulmonary
 edema, perhaps slightly improved in the interval.  Bibasilar patchy opacities
 are likely reflective of atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures and upper abdomen are without an
 acute abnormality.  Multiple clips are again noted within the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As previously demonstrated on prior chest radiograph, relative ___
 lung bases is likely secondary to overlying soft tissue.
 
 Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette stable relative to prior study with mild
 pulmonary edema, perhaps slightly improved.  Bibasilar atelectasis, though
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
