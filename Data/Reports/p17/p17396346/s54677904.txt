                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF, COPD, now with shortness of breath and hypoxemia,
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal supine portable view of the chest provided.  Examination
 limited due to underpenetrated technique and low lung volumes.  Allowing for
 this, there is increased mid and lower lung opacities, left greater than
 right, which could represent pulmonary edema, asymmetric, though a
 superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Effusions,
 probable bilateral and small likely present.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Bony structures are intact.  Clips in the left axilla
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for pulmonary edema with possible
 superimposed consolidation in the left lower lobe.  Probable small bilateral
 effusions.  Limited exam.
