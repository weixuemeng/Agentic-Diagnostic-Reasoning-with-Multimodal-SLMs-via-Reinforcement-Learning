                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Upper abdominal pain, cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 areas of linear atelectasis/scarring in the right middle and lower lobes. 
 Subtle blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral view may be
 artifactual, although trace pleural effusions are not excluded.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  Mild pulmonary edema is again seen, similar to
 prior.  Surgical clips are again seen projecting over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Areas of
 atelectasis/scarring.
