                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral hazy opacities, in particular overlying the lower lobes,
 are noted, suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears enlarged.  There are also small bilateral pleural
 effusions. Bibasilar opacities, which is more pronounced in the retrocardiac
 region, likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Post-surgical changes are
 noted in the left axilla.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectatic change, but an
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
