                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 image is somewhat obscured by overlying soft tissues causing scattered
 radiation.  The pulmonary vessels are not well seen, consistent with some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Streaks overlying the cardiac
 silhouette on the lateral view are consistent with middle lobe and lingular
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to
 exclude supervening pneumonia.
