 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___

 There are low lung volumes.  There is at least mild to moderate background
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities are likely due to moderately-sized
 pleural effusions, although superimposed atelectasis or pneumonia would be
 difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax.  Severe cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate background pulmonary edema.
 2. Worsening bibasilar opacities, largely due to moderately-sized pleural
 effusions.  Superimposed atelectasis or pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude.
 3. Low lung volumes.
