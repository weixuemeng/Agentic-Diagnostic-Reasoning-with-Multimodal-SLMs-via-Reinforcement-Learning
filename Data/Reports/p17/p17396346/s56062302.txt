                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion that
 appears to be less prominent, especially on the right.  The right costophrenic
 angle is sharply seen.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.  
 
 No definite pneumonia is appreciated, though this could be obscured by the
 cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.
