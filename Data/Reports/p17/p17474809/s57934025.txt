                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 PE and CHF with recent pneumonia.  A right at outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right PICC is in place with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial
 junction.  Left pectoral AICD is in place with leads in appropriate position. 
 There is postoperative appearance of the mediastinum.  Lung volumes are low
 which limits evaluation of heart size since but is probably normal.  There are
 widespread nodular opacities of varying size with associated bronchial wall
 thickening bilaterally.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread, bilateral varying nodular opacities and bronchial wall thickening
 could represent bronchopneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Comparison to prior
 studies, if available, would be helpful to trace evolution.
