                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the preexisting bilateral
 parenchymal opacities have moderately increased in extent and severity.  The
 opacities are more confluent and show more air bronchograms.  The lung volumes
 remain low.  The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper range of normal.
 
 The right PICC line and the pacemaker leads are in constant position.  No
 pleural effusion.
