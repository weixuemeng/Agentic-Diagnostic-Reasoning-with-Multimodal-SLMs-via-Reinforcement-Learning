                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest with new subclavian central venous
 catheter.  Assess catheter position and evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 4:45 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of this radiograph.  The
 endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating 1.8 cm above the level of the
 carina.  A new enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and
 out of the field of view inferiorly.  There has been interval placement of a
 right subclavian central venous catheter, ending near the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  The exam is otherwise unchanged compared to the prior radiographs
 from 25 minutes ago.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned right subclavian central venous catheter, without
 evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Low-lying endotracheal tube, terminating 1.8 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Repositioning is recommended.  This finding was discussed with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ at 6:55 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study, 5
 minutes after discovery.
 
 3.  Unchanged right lung opacities, fully described on the prior radiograph
 report from ___ at 4:45 a.m.  Please see this report for details.
