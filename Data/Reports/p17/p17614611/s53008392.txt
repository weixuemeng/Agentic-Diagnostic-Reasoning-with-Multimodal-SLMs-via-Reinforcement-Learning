                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest.  Assess for acute process and confirm
 endotracheal tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of these radiographs. 
 The endotracheal tube ends 3 cm above the level of the carina.  There is a
 right upper lobe consolidation versus mass, occupying the majority of the lung
 apex.  Heterogeneous right mid and lower lung opacities are also noted,
 possibly asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection.  There are also
 heterogeneous left lower lung opacities, possibly atelectasis versus
 aspiration pneumonitis.  The remainder of the left lung is clear.  The heart
 is normal in size.  There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Several bilateral rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
 
 2.  Right upper lobe mass/consolidation warrants further evaluation with CT.
 
 3.  Heterogeneous right mid and lower lung opacities, possibly asymmetric
 pulmonary edema versus infection.
 
 4.  Left lower lung opacities could be atelectasis or aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 5.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures, likely related to recent cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation.
