                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe pneumonia with continued fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable allowing
 for differences in technique.  The parenchyma appears in general better
 aerated, but there is persistent right lower lung opacity suggesting a
 combination of atelectasis and possibly pleural effusion, although findings
 are very similar to prior CT and radiographs from ___.  More
 recent radiographs did not include lateral views, but an attempt to compare
 the lateral view to the prior chest CT shows perhaps a more bulging contour to
 the pleural effusion in the right lower hemithorax than before, although not
 necessarily larger.  This appearance suggests evolving loculation of a likely
 small chronic effusion.  Adjacent parenchymal opacity on the lateral view does
 not necessarily appear increased.  Regarding rib findings, although not well
 delineated on more recent prior radiographs, non-united discontinuities of the
 right seventh and eighth ribs were already present before and probably
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall improved aeration of the lungs.  Persistent patchy
 opacities and pleural effusion in the right lower hemithorax with volume loss,
 but suspected to represent baseline chronic findings.
