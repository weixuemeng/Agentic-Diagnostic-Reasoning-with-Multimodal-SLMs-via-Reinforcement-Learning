                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Increased distention of the neoesophagus is apparent
 with an air-fluid level in the mid neoesophagus and contrast in the distal
 neoesophagus.  Thin curvilinear lucency along the contour of the neoesophagus
 persists.  Small right pleural effusion is stable.  Chain sutures in the
 medial aspect of the right mid lung are stable.  The left lung is clear other
 than small stable left base atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased distention of the neoesophagus with an air-fluid level and
 contrast pooling distally.  
 2.  Curvilinear lucency along the contour of neoesophagus persists.
