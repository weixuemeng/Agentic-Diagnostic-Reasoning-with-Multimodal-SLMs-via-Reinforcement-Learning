                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy on ___, with fever and a white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Consolidation in both mid and lower lung zones has been intermittent.  It was
 worst on the left on ___, subsequently improved and is now clear aside
 from minimal interstitial abnormality.  On the right, it developed between
 ___, improved later that day, and has recurred.  I don't see how
 we can distinguish between aspiration, with or without pneumonia, and
 atelectasis.  Caliber of the esophageal conduit, two-thirds filled with fluid,
 is slightly larger today than yesterday.  Heart size is normal.  Miniscule
 right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
