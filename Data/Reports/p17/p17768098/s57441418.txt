 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Enteric tube is seen within the
 neo-esophagus, which is located posterior and right of the mediastinum.  There
 is no significant esophageal dilation.  There are no air-fluid levels.  
 
 A right chest tube is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Significant
 atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged while there is improved
 aeration at the left lung base.  A small amount of subcutaneous emphysema
 persists.  Mildly dilated, air-filled loops of large bowel are unchanged.
