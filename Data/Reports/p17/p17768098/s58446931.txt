                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after laparoscopic
 esophagectomy, re-assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The neoesophagus is delineated by the IV contrast.  Contrast material appears
 to be decreased in amount as compared to prior study but still present in the
 distal neoesophagus.  Air-fluid line is at the level of mid esophagus.  It is
 located near the suture lines.  There is also a small amount of pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Left lung is essentially clear except for
 minimal basal atelectasis.
