                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post esophagectomy, with chest tube placed to water seal. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 12 hours prior, as well as
 from ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph redemonstrates the nasogastric tube in the
 mid neoesophagus, a right chest tube, and a right chest drain, all unchanged
 in position.  Unchanged lucency under the diaphragm mostly represents
 distended colon, as well as possibly a small amount of postoperative
 pneumoperitoneum.  Mediastinal widening is decreased, without evidence of
 mediastinal fluid collection or unexpected distention of the neoesophagus. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is improved.  A tiny probable effusion is unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Decreased mediastinal widening and improved bibasilar atelectasis. 
 
 3.  Unchanged subdiaphragmatic lucency mostly represents distended colon, as
 well as possibly a small amount of postoperative pneumoperitoneum.
