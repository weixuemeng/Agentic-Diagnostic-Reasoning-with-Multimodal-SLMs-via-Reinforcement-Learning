                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post minimally invasive esophagectomy and pull-up
 procedure.  The neoesophagus appears slightly less distended but more
 fluid-filled with the air-fluid level now at the level of the fifth posterior
 rib and previously at the seventh posterior rib level.  Contrast continues to
 pool within the lower portion of the neoesophagus.  Small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion appears similar with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Within the left lung, linear atelectasis persists with otherwise clear
 appearance of the left lung.
