                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest three AP upright portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post esophagectomy, status post NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 14:25.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple AP portable upright images of the chest were obtained. 
 While an NG tube is in place, initially, the NG tube is coiled in the upper
 thoracic inlet; however, it was then repositioned and advanced into the right
 hemithorax.  There is now less fluid in the esophagus.  The course of the
 nasogastric tube is similar to that seen on prior radiographs including
 ___.  Chain sutures are again seen in the right upper lobe.  There are
 chronic changes at the right lung base including scarring.  There is a
 probable small right pleural effusion.  Contrast is again seen in the distal
 esophagus.  Left basilar atelectasis is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a NG tube terminates in the right lower hemithorax,
 most likely within the neoesophagus.  The position of the NG tube is similar
 to prior studies including ___ and ___.  It appears to course
 superior to the carina.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
