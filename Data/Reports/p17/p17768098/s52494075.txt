                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Air-fluid level in the neoesophagus has improved.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There is
 blunting of the right CP angle, suggestive of a small effusion, unchanged. 
 New opacities in the left lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
