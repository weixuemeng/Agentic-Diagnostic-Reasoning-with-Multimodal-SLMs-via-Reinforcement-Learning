                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval increase in distention of the neoesophagus in this patient
 status post esophagectomy and pull-up procedure. Additionally, there is a new 
 crescenteric lucency adjacent to the upper lateral wall of the neoesophagus
 lateral to teh suture line. There remains a collection of contrast within the
 distal aspect of the neoesophagus.  Moderate right pleural effusion has
 slightly increased in size, with adjacent worsening atelectasis at the right
 base.  Within the left lung, linear opacities at the left lung base are likely
 predominantly due to atelectasis, but there may be some residual barium
 outlining the bronchial walls in this region in this patient with previously
 documented barium aspiration.  Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen,
 distended loops of bowel are present in both large and small bowel loops with
 multiple air-fluid levels.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing distention of proximal neoesophagus, with a new crescenteric
 lucency lateral to suture line along lateral wall. Although possibly
 projectional, short-term radiographic follow up or CT may be helpful to
 exclude a postop complication in this region.
 
 Persistent collection of contrast in distal neoesophagus.
 
 Distended loops of bowel are present in both large and small bowel loops with
 multiple air-fluid levels.  Consider a dedicated abdominal series to
 distinguish post-operative ileus from obstruction
