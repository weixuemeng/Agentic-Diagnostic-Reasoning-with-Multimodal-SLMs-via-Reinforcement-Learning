                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post esophagogastrectomy.  The neoesophagus
 remains distended, and a column of barium persists in the distal portion of
 the neoesophagus, with the barium column slightly more distal than on the
 prior radiograph of a few hours earlier.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 appears similar, but adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in right middle
 and right lower lobes has slightly improved.  Patchy and linear atelectasis at
 left base is slightly worse.
