                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man, status post MIE, check interval change in
 neoesophagus post-EGD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest shows interval improvement of
 neoesophagus distention with resolution of air-fluid level.  The collection of
 contrast in the distal portion of the neoesophagus has reduced, although
 present since ___ and concerning for obstruction at the lower
 neoesophagus.  Right lung volume is unchanged with stable right lung base
 opacity mainly due to right lower lobe atelectasis.  The left lung is clear
 except for small linear opacity in the left costophrenic angle, probably due
 to a small atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement of neo-esophaus distention. Persistence of contrast
 material collection in the distal neoesophagus indicating obstruction to
 antegrade passage.
 2.  Stable right lung base opacity due to atelectasis is overall unchanged. 
 Small left lung base linear atelectasis.
