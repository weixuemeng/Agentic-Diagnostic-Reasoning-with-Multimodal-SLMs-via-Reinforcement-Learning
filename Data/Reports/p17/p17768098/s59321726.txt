                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The neoesophagus appears to be unremarkable.  Right basal opacity has slightly
 increased might potentially reflect atelectasis.  On the other hand, there is
 slight interval improvement of left basal opacity with some minimal focal
 consolidation seen.  There is no pleural effusion and there is no
 pneumothorax.  No appreciable pleural effusion demonstrated.
