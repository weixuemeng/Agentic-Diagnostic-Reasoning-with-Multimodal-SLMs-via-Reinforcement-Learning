 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular structures.  Despite this limitation, there is an apparent
 new focal area of opacity in the periphery of the left lower lobe, concerning
 for an early focus of pneumonia.  Remainder of lungs are grossly clear, and
 there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal left lower lobe pneumonia.  Findings entered into radiology
 communications dashboard on date of study along with recommendations for
 followup chest x-ray in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy.
