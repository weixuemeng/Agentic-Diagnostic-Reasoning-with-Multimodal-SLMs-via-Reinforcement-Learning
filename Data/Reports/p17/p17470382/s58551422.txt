                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History of fall on the left side with left paraspinal lumbar
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Again noted is
 moderate hiatal hernia with streaky opacities suggesting minor associated
 atelectasis, which is unchanged, within the left lower lobe.  In the right
 upper lobe there is a vague streaky opacity, correlating without previous site
 of more extensive opacification, perhaps residual scarring from prior
 infection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A moderate L1
 compression fracture was already present before there is new mild to moderate
 biconcave loss in height of T12, age-indeterminant. The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or intrathoracic injury.
 
 2.  Compression deformities of T12 and L1, the latter probably unchanged, the
 former new and age-indeterminate although not necessarily acute.
 
 3.  Moderate hiatal hernia.
