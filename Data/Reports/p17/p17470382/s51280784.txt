                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS, fever  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and cardiomediastinal contours are similar to prior. Lung
 volumes are low.  Increased left base opacity is likely related to large
 hiatal hernia. Vague heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lobe is similar
 to prior, likely residual scarring.  No pneumothorax or substantial pleural
 effusion.  Large hiatal hernia is similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large hiatal hernia. On this single projection, it is difficult to exclude
 an adjacent left lower lobe abnormality, and standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs are suggested for this purpose when the patient's condition
 permits.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
