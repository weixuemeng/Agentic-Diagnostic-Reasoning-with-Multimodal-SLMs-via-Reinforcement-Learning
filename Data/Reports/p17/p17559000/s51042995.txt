                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post esophagogastrectomy.  Status post removal of right-sided
 chest tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is persistent opacification of the left lower hemithorax with a
 suspected moderate pleural effusion.  Persistent multifocal opacities in the
 right lung as well as a small band-like left mid lung opacity suggest
 multifocal atelectasis.  There is a small area of vague lucency near the prior
 entry site of the right-sided chest tube which suggests there may be a trace
 loculated pneumothorax in the area as well as minimal subcutaneous emphysema. 
 However, the lung is expanded and there are no other areas of suspected
 intrathoracic air.  ___ project along the base of the left neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Persistent left basilar opacification suggesting pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis.  Infection is difficult to exclude, however.  
 
 2.  Small area of lucency along the course of the prior chest tube near its
 entry site into the right lower lateral chest, suggesting a very small
 loculated pneumothorax.
