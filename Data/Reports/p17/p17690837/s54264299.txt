                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia, status post thymectomy, with abdominal
 pain, nausea, question effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 persistent left lower lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion.  There has
 been interval improvement in aeration at the right lung base and minimal
 residual right pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation likely representing
 atelectasis with pleural effusion, not significantly changed from prior CT. 
 Improved aeration at the right lung base with small residual right pleural
 effusion.
