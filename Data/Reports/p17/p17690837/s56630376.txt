 INDICATION:  Status post VATS, evaluation for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, the postoperative changes on the
 left have normalized.  There is a minimal pleural scar projecting over the
 costophrenic sinus, but no evidence of acute disease.  The pre-existing
 right-sided atelectasis has completely resolved.
