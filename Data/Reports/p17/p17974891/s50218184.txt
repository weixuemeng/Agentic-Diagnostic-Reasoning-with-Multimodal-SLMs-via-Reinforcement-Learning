                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ileus, status post NG tube
 placement, evaluate NG tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  There is now
 some evidence of mild cardiac enlargement coinciding with elevated diaphragms
 and some blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus.  These described findings
 are new in comparison with the normal-appearing chest findings with normal
 heart and free pleural spaces of the previous examination.  An NG tube is
 identified, seen to reach in the lower esophagus, but not passing the hiatus
 and not reaching the stomach.  Telephone message was rendered to ___ at 3:45
 p.m.  It was observed that not less than nine individual exposures were
 obtained.  On the last of these, the line has passed below the diaphragmatic
 level, but it is questionable whether the sideport has reached that far.  It
 was recommended to advance NG tube further.
