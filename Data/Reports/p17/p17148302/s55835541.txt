                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pancreatic adenoma status post Whipple
 admitted for worsening shortness of breath, admission chest x-ray with
 possible left middle lobe pneumonia, currently on cefepime and linezolid. 
 Increasing leukocytosis.  Please evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Heart is normal
 size and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Drainage catheter noted
 within the upper abdomen.  Right PICC is stable.  Increased opacification of
 the left base is consistent with atelectasis and small pleural effusion,
 although an superimposed consolidation cannot be exluded.  No interval changes
 in the right lung.  Small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening opacification within the left base, likely a
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis but in the appropriate
 clinical context pneumonia cannot be excluded.
