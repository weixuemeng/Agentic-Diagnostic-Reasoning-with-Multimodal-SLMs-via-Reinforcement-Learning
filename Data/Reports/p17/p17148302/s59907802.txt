                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new pulmonary nodules and orthopnea, clear
 lung exam and no cough, ? interval change, ? etiology of dyspnea/orthopnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The position of central venous catheter is unchanged. 
 Abdominal drain noted.  Increased opacification adjacent to the right heart
 border reflects consolidation within the right middle lobe.  There is also a
 small left pleural effusion along with patchy opacifications of the lingula. 
 In the appropriate clinical context, this represents right middle lobe
 pneumonia as well as possibly developing pneumonia within the lingula.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Opacification of the right middle lobe and lingula is consistent with
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
