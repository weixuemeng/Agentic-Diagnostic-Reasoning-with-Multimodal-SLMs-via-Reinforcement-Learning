                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 but aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions may be present.  Heart size is difficult to assess but is likely
 within normal limits.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and
 there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is noted.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present.
