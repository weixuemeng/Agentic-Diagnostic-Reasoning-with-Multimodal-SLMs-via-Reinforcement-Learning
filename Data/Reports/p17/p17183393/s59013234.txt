                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Acute stroke, question consolidation in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  There is no definite
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is an irregular density in
 the right mid lung projecting between the right fifth and sixth posterior rib
 arch, which may represent calcified pleural plaque.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. 
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Calcified pleural plaque accounts
 for irregular density overlying the right mid lung - partially confirmed on
 CTA head/neck performed subsequently.
