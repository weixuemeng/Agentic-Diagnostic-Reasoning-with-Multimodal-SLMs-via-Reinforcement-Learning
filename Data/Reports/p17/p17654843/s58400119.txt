                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left costal pain status post fall, here to
 evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An irregularity in the left anterolateral third rib
 better appreciated on the preceding study may represent a nondisplaced
 fracture.  The known T11 fracture cannot be assessed on this study.  Low
 inspiratory lung volumes with slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 likely due to suboptimal inspiration with associated atelectasis at the left
 lung base.  The lungs are otherwise clear without large pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible nondisplaced fracture of the left anterolateral third
 rib.
