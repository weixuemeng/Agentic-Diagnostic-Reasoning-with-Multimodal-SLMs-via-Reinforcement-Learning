                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Minimal mid lung atelectasis/scarring seen, best on the lateral view. 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture
 seen.  However, if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, suggest
 dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
