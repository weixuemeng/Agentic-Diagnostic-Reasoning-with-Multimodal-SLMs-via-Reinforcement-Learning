                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with n meningitidis bacteremia and bibasilar
 consolidation on OSH CXR (?PNA vs atelectasis). Lung exam normal  // ?
 Persistent consolidation in lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable within the
 limitations of the CV air dextroscoliosis. Bibasal linear opacities are most
 likely consistent with atelectasis and there is no definitive evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 Nodular opacities projecting over the right apex, 4.7 mm in diameter. This
 relatively dense and gas most likely represent calcified granuloma but
 comparison with prior studies is required. If not available, reassessment with
 chest radiograph in 3 months is recommended or alternatively chest CT for
 documentation of stability.
