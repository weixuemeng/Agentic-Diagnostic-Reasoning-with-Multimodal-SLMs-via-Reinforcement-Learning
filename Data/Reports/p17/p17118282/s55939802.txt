                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:50 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  DKA and pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread pulmonary abnormality consisting of nodules and linear opacities is
 not the pattern one would expect from bacterial pneumonia. Its chronicity is
 indeterminate, and some could be granulomatosis due to inhalational or
 intravenous illicit drug use. Mycoplasma or viral infection can give this
 pattern, but opportunistic infections--___ on the patient's immune
 status--___ miliary tuberculosis, pneumocystis, and disseminated
 histoplasmosis should be considered.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is mildly engorged.  There is no pleural effusion, and heart size
 is normal.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone.  Since he tells me
 that the patient has has recent severe weight loss, the more subacute
 diagnoses become more likely and disseminated carcinoma should be added to the
 list of possible diagnoses.
