                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Difficulty speaking and swallowing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes which account for bibasilar atelectasis
 as well as crowding of the bronchovascular structures and mild cardiomegaly. 
 There is a very tortuous aorta with calcifications of the aortic knob.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.
 
 An upper lumbar compression fracture is evident, but age indeterminate. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Given low lung volumes, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
