                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Right lung wedge resection, evaluate for
 post-op changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest tube projecting over the right midlung is associated with
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Allowing for this, there is moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Status post right lung wedge resection with right chest tube in place and
 no pneumothorax.
 2. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.
 3. Low lung volumes.
