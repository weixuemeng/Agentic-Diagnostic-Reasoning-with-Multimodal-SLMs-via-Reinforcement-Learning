                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable marked
 cardiomegaly.  There is a right pectoral cardiac pacer with a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Minimal unfolding of the thoracic aorta is noted, with
 arch calcifications.  The lungs are relatively well aerated.  Apparent
 increased lower lobe opacity on one of the lateral views does not persist on a
 second lateral view, felt to most likely represent summation of shadows from
 normal vascular structures.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion. 
 Remote rib fracture is present on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite evidence to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Stable massive cardiomegaly without definite evidence to suggest
 decompensation.
