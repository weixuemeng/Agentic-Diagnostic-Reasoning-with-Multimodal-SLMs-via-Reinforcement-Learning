                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Single-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen,
 unchanged in position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged,
 likely grossly stable given differences in inspiration.  There is mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild interstitial edema. 
 It is difficult to exclude a right small pleural effusion due to overlying
 soft tissue partially obscuring the right costophrenic angle.  Deformity of
 the posterior right seventh rib is compatible with prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 minimal interstitial edema.
