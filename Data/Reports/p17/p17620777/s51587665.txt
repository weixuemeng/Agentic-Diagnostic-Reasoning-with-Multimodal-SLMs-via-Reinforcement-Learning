                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with non productive cough, O2 sat mid 90s
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic aorta. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, more so within the
 retrocardiac region, findings which rate may reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine with compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body appearing unchanged.
 Previously demonstrated lytic lesion involving the left second posterior rib
 is better appreciated on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the
 left, may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
