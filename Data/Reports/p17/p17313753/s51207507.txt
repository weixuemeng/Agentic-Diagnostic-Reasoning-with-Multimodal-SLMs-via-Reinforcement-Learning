                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer with hypoxia and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  Again seen is a large right
 lower lobe opacity, representing known mass.  Superinfection cannot be
 excluded.  A small small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is seen and
 appears increased since the prior exam.  Hyperlucency of the upper lung zones
 and hyperinflation is consistent with known emphysema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No left pleural effusion is identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  A VP shunt catheter courses along the right hemithorax
 and is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large opacity within the right lower lobe representing known mass. 
 Superinfection cannot be excluded with subtle suggestio of associated air
 bronchograms.
 
 2.  Increasing right pleural effusion.
