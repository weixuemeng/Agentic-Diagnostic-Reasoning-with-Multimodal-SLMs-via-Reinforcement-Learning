                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for mass or pneumonia in a patient with hemoptysis and
 cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Lung volumes are slightly low with associated crowding of
 bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or mass.  If hemoptysis persists, CT would be
 recommended to exclude a radiographically occult cause for the symptom.
