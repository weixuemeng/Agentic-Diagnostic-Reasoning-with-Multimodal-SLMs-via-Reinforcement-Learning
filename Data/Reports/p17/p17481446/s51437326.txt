                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post arrest with intubation.  Evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are
 widespread left greater than right opacities compatible with pulmonary edema
 which is exaggerated by extremely low lung volumes and concurrent left lung
 base atelectasis.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is
 in place, 4 cm cranial to the carina in standard position.  A right internal
 jugular approach central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC.  An
 upper enteric tube is in place in the distal stomach out of view of imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary edema. Support devices in
 standard positioning.
