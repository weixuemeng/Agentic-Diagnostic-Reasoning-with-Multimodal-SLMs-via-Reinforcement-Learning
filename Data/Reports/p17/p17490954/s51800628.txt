                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of recent fall with known multiple rib
 fractures.  Patient now presenting with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest with contrast from ___ and chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a small left pleural effusion
 with associated atelectasis.  Subtle reticular opacities within the left lung
 base correspond with mild fibrotic changes seen on recent CT.  No new
 confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  Right apical volume
 loss is consistent with known prior right upper lobectomy.  There are numerous
 contiguous left-sided rib fractures, unchanged from prior.  Chronic healed
 right-sided rib fractures are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
 
 2.  Stable left basilar interstitial opacities consistent with mild fibrosis.
 
 3.  Unchanged subacute left-sided rib fractures.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___ at
 approximately 2:45 p.m. on ___ by telephone 2 minutes after
 discovery.
