                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dementia, acute mental status change and
 possible syncope with fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Fontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded.  The
 previously seen focal area of increased density at the right lung base has
 improved; however, there is vague, more diffuse, subtle increased density at
 the right lung base, which may reflect an ongoing infectious process.  The
 left lung is essentially clear.  Multiple healed rib fractures of the left
 upper posterior ribs are again noted as well as chronic abnormalities of the
 right posterior rib 6.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent subtle vague increased density at the right lung base,
 which may indicate a residual consolidation.
