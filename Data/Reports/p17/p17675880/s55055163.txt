 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure, presenting with shortness of

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  As
 before, there is a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and right
 ventricular leads.  Heterogeneous opacities in the right lower lobe are new
 compared to the prior radiographs from ___, concerning for
 either aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.  There is minimal left basilar
 atelectasis.  A small right pleural effusion is not significantly changed in
 size.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Aortic knob calcifications are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 evidence of a calcified left ventricular aneurysm, better seen on prior CT
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia, new compared to
 prior radiographs from ___.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion, not significantly changed.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 5:34 p.m. via telephone
