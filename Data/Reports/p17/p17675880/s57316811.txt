                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of congestive heart failure
 with orthopnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacemaker/AICD generator overlies the left chest with the leads
 intact and unchanged in standard position.  Interstitial opacities throughout
 both lungs have increased in comparison to recent examination.  Furthermore,
 there is increased perihilar indistinctness as well as increased cardiomegaly.
 These findings are suggestive of interval development of mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Previously visualized right lower lobe opacity has minimally
 improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Curvilinear calcifications along the
 left heart border appears stable and corresponds with a calcified aneurysm of
 the left ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of new mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Increased cardiomegaly, now moderate.
 3.  Increased Small right pleural effusion.
