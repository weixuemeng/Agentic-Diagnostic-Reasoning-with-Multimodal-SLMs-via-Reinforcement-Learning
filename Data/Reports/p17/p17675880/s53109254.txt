                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs with the latest one on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a consolidation of the right lower lobe, with a more
 patchy opacity in the mid lung field accompanied by a moderate pleural
 effusion in this side.  The right hemidiaphragm is obscured but the right
 heart border is well defined.
 
 There is a patchy opacity also in the left lower lung field, but no blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle.  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly with
 bilateral hilar prominence and vascular upper redistribution.  The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable and there is no pneumothorax.  A pacemaker generator
 is noted in the left axilla with the leads ending in expected positions in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overal pattern compatible with congestive heart failure with
 superimposed right lower lobe consolidations concerning for
 infectious/inflammatory process.
