                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The heart is
 mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a mild background interstitial
 abnormality, possibly due to slight chronic congestion, but improved somewhat
 since the prior examination.  A new right basilar opacity is present.  An
 increasing pleural effusion, potentially with a degree of loculation, is noted
 on the right, now probably small to moderate in size associated with
 increasing posterior opacity.  A trace pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude on the left. There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes
 are noted along the mid to lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat improved background vascular congestion but increasing
 right basilar opacity and effusion.  Differential considerations include an
 increasing effusion associated with congestive heart failure and associated
 atelectasis, although pneumonia could also be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
