                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Leads of a left chest
 wall pacer terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is similar to prior and mediastinal contours are stable.  Rounded
 calcification at the base of the heart is consistent with a known left
 ventricular aneurysm.  Bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis. 
 Increased pulmonary vascular markings are consistent with mild congestion. 
 Small right subpulmonic effusion is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion with unchanged
 small right subpulmonic effusion.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly with unchanged left ventricular aneurysm.
