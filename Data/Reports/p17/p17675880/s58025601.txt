                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury,
 history of scant hemoptysis and persistent cough and recent pneumonia as well
 as a ___-pack-year history concerning for malignant process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates near complete
 resolution of right lower and left lower lung opacifications with only minimal
 residual bibasilar and left upper lobe atelectasis.  The right pleural
 effusion has substantially decreased in size, now small.  Stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Please note
 portions of the left lung are obscured by overlying pacemaker which has leads
 positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: Significantly improved bibasilar consolidations and right pleural
 effusion, now small in size, given significant change in short period of time,
 earlier findings were likely related to volume overload.
