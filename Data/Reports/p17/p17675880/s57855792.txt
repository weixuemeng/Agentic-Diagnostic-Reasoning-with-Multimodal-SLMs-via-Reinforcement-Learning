                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, abnormal labs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. 
 Rounded ring like calcification projecting over the midline lower thorax is
 compatible with a known left ventricular aneurysm.  Heart remains moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  The hilar contours are stable, and there
 is improvement in the previous pattern of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are present, with
 interval increase in the amount of fluid within the left pleural space.  Dense
 opacification within the retrocardiac region is nonspecific and could reflect
 atelectasis, pneumonia, or aspiration.  Linear opacities within the right lung
 base likely reflect chronic changes.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the left compared to the
 prior study.
 2.  Opacification within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 3.  Interval improvement in previous pattern of pulmonary vascular congestion.
