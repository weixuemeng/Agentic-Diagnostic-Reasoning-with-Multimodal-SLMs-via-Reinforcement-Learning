                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath for two nights.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A pacemaker/AICD generator overlies the
 left chest.  The leads appear intact and in unchanged standard position. 
 Interstitial opacities throughout both lungs have increased compared to recent
 prior examination.  Additionally, there is perihilar indistinctness and
 increasing cardiomegaly, findings suggestive of interval development of mild
 pulmonary edema.  No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Curvilinear calcifications along the left heart border
 correspond with a calcified aneurysm of the left ventricle, unchanged in
 appearance compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of new mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increasing cardiomegaly, now moderate.
 
 3.  No large pleural effusions.
