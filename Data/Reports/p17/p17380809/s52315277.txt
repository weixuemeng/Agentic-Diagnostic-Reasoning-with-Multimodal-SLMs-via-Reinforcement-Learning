                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  MVA small right pneumothorax, intubated.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 3.9 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach but side port
 of the NG tube is at the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced.  A
 tooth is stable in the stomach.  Right apical pneumothorax is small, measuring
 at most 12mm.  The comparison is hard due to different positioning of the
 patient.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Previous bilateral lung opacities
 have cleared rapidly and were mostly consistent with aspiration.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  Right
 subclavian line ends in lower SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Side port of NG tube is at the gastroesophageal junction and could be
 advanced a few centimeters.
 2.  Small right pneumothorax.
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
