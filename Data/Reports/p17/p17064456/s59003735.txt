                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post kidney transplant, fell,
 evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The patient is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple
 surgical clips are indicative of preceding bypass surgery.  The heart size has
 not changed significantly.  Observed is the removal of a previously present
 wide caliber dialysis catheter entered via the right internal jugular
 approach.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested and no new acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates can be seen. 
 Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. When comparison is made with a
 preceding examination, there is no evidence of any new rib abnormality such as
 non-displaced fissure or other rib deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Standard views PA and lateral chest x-ray do not disclose any new
 pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormality.  As there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax, new pleural effusions or parenchymal abnormalities, the
 identification of local rib injuries could be performed by identifying the
 area of distinct local discomfort and to perform dedicated skeletal
 radiographs.
