                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of poorly controlled diabetes, neuropathy.  Please
 evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  There is increased fullness of the left
 hilum.  There also appears to be a subtle increase in opacification overlying
 the right upper lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Subtle increase in opacification overlying the upper right lung which
 could be secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema, however an infectious
 process cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Increased fullness at the left hilum likely secondary to reactive
 lymphadenopathy, however a CT is recommended for further evaluation.
