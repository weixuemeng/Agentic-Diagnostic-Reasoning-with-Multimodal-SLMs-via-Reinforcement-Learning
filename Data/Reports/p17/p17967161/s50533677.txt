                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is somewhat limited by motion overlying soft tissue.
 
 The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. There is elevation of the apparent right
 hemidiaphragm with lateralization of the apex, raising the possibility of a
 subpulmonic effusion. There is no strong evidence for pulmonary edema.  Heart
 is mildly enlarged but unchanged, accounting for differences in technique. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Elevation of the apparent right hemidiaphragm raises the possibility of a
 subpulmonic effusion.
 2. Low lung volumes without strong evidence for pulmonary edema. Repeat
 examination with full inspiratory effort would be useful.
