                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with failure to thrive who presents with
 tachypnea and weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The aorta
 remains tortuous with dilatation of the ascending aorta better assessed on the
 previous CT.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 most likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Mild scarring is noted in the lung apices.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
