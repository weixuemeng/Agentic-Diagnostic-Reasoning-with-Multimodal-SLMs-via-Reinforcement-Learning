                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory distress, here to evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC.  A Dobbhoff feeding
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and coiling in the left upper
 quadrant, likely within the gastric fundus.  The lungs are symmetrically well
 expanded without pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heterogeneous
 opacification of the right lung base is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Multiple surgical clips in the right
 axilla are compatible with prior lymph node dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Stable right lower lobe heterogeneous opacification representing
 aspiration or pneumonia.
 3.  No overt pulmonary edema.
