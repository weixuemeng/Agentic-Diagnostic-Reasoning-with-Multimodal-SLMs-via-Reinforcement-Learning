                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been removal of
 the chest tube.  The nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein
 catheter are in unchanged position.  The parenchymal opacities in both lungs
 are constant in appearance.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The presence of
 a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax or newly
 appeared changes.
