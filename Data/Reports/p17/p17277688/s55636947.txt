                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mediastinal washout/LVAD  // follow up
 edema/effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph supine
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  The patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube
 terminates approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. A Swan-Ganz
 catheter is in-situ, this appears to have been withdrawn slightly when
 compared to the prior study but appears in appropriate position.  There are
 bilateral chest tubes as well as the mediastinal drain in-situ.  A nasogastric
 tube is unchanged in position.  .  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. 
 There are patchy airspace opacities throughout both lungs with more prominent
 on the right than the left likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema.  This
 is grossly unchanged compared to the prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of multiple chest tubes, no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax seen.
