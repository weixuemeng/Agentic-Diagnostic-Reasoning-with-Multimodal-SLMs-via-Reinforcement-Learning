                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS and septic shock.  Evaluate OG tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Upper enteric drainage tube has been advanced beyond the mid
 stomach and out of view.  Severe extensive pulmonary consolidation has not
 improved since earlier in the day.  Small right pleural effusion stable.  No
 pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiac enlargement, unchanged.
 
 Of note, high attenuation values of consolidation on the subsequent chest CT
 increase the likelihood of widespread pulmonary hemorrhage.
