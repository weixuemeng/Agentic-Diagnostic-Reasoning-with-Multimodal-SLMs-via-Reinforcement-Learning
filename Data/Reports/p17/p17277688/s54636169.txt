                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p ECMO, H.Flu pneumonia  // post bronch
 eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the pulmonary outflow tract.  The
 left-sided central line terminates in the mid to lower SVC.  The endotracheal
 tube is 5 cm above the carina.  The enteric tube extends beyond the GE
 junction with tip out of view.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  There has been interval aeration of the left upper lung. There is a
 persistent left retrocardiac opacity which may represent a small left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Airspace opacities in the right lung appear
 unchanged compared to prior study likely representing pulmonary edema, however
 a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patient is status post bronchoscopy with interval aeration of the left
 upper lung.
 2. Multiple airspace opacities in the right lung are unchanged compared to
 prior study, likely representing pulmonary edema, however a superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 3. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents small left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.
