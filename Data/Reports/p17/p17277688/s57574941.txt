                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with endotracheal tube, assess position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest provided.  Endotracheal tube is seen
 with its tip residing approximately 6.4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
 courses below the left hemidiaphragm, though distal side port likely resides
 above the gastroesophageal junction and therefore advancement by at least 8-9
 mm would result in more optimal positioning.  There are dense consolidations
 within both lungs, containing air bronchograms, concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia.  The presence of layering effusions is difficult to exclude.  The
 heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is also difficult to
 assess, though appears grossly within normal limits.  The bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly high position of the endotracheal tube residing
 approximately 6.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube should be advanced by at least
 8-9 mm for more optimal positioning.  Dense bilateral pulmonary consolidations
 containing air bronchograms, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
