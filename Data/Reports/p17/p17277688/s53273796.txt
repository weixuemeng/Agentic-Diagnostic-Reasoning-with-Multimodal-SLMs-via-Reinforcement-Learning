 effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change in
 the monitoring and support devices.  Again there is substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  These
 most likely reflect substantial pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be
 considered.
