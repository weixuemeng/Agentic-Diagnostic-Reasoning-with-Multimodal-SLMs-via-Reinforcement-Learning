                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Prominent retrocardiac density is unchanged, possibly
 representing a large hiatal hernia.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There
 is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Lungs are clear.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple
 right-sided rib deformities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia or interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2. Unchanged right-sided rib deformities compatible with age indeterminate
 fracture.
 3. Possible large hiatal hernia.
