                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening lower extremity edema and dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is top normal.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Questionable nodular opacities projecting over the left upper lung over the
 anterior portion of the third rib.  Shallow anterior oblique views are
 recommended for precise characterization of the finding which most likely
 represents summation of shadows but potentially might represent pulmonary
 nodule.
