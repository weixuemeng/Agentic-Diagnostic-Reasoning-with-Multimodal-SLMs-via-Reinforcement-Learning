                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with one sided opacity. on ventilation  // assess
 interval progress
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 ET tube tip approximately 6.4 cm above the carina, at the level of the
 inferior edge of the mid medial clavicular heads.  NG tube present --  likely
 extends beneath the diaphragm, but is not well visualized, due to
 underpenetration and cough of film at this level. Note made of probe overlying
 the lower left chest --___ may lie outside the the patient.   No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There diffusely increased
 interstitial markings, in keeping with findings on the previous film.  The
 asymmetric increased opacity previously seen in right upper and and adjoining
 midzone appears less dense on the current examination.  However, on the
 current film, there is focal increased hazy opacity in the right mid and lower
 zones, with new obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which may reflect a
 pleural effusion.  The left costophrenic sulcus is grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET and NG tube, as described.
 2. Diffusely increased interstitial markings again seen.  The right upper zone
 appears slightly more aerated, though remains diffusely abnormal.
 3. New hazy opacity at right lung base obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. 
 This could reflect a pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
