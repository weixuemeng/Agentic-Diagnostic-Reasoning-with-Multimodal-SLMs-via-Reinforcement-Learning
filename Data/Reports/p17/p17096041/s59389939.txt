                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o man admitted with history IPH s/p hemicraniectomy with
 residual neurological deficits presenting for altered mental status, found to
 be in hypercarbic respiratory failure with evidence of right lung
 opacification on CXR.  // compare to prior
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  Endotracheal tube and
 right-sided PICC are unchanged in position.  There is persistent and slightly
 increased airspace opacification seen at the right lung base with partial
 silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm.  While this may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, infection cannot be excluded.  No definite pleural effusion
 seen.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in the right basal airspace opacity.  While this may
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, the appearances are suspicious for right
 lower lobe consolidation.
