                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ICH, respiratory failure  // eval for
 pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal
 interstitial edema.  More confluent right infrahilar opacity probably
 represents asymmetrical edema given similar distribution on prior radiographs,
 it is less likely due to localized aspiration or developing infectious
 pneumonia.
