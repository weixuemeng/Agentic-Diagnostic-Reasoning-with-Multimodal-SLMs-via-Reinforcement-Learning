                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple rib fractures, PTX on right  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A 12 mm right apical pneumothorax is minimally changed compared to the prior
 study in ___ where it measured 11 mm.  No pneumothorax on the left.
 Lung volumes are lower.  New hazy perihilar opacities, right greater than
 left, is most consistent with asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 atelectasis is likely also present at the left lung base.  No other focal
 pulmonary consolidation.  Trace fissural fluid is seen on the right.  No
 pleural effusion on the left.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac contour is new.
 Mildly displaced right-sided lower rib fractures are unchanged.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema along the right lateral chest wall and left tissues of the neck are
 new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable right apical pneumothorax.
 2. New neck and lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, raises the
 possibility of underlying communication with the pleural space.
 3. Findings consistent with volume overload or heart failure including new
 cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
 4. Known mildly displaced right-sided rib fractures.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:06 AM, 20 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
