 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a persistent right
 apical pneumothorax, now measuring approximately 9 mm, minimally decreased in
 size since the most recent comparison.  There is no left-sided pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral hazy opacities are again seen, worse on the right than on the left,
 unchanged since the examination from several hours prior, and most consistent
 with asymmetric edema.  Likely bilateral pleural effusions are present.
 Subcutaneous emphysema is persistent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No appreciable change from exam from 3 hours prior.
