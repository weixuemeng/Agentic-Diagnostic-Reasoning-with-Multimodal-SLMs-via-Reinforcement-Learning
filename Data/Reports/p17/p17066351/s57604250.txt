 pneumothorax, please perform ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs.
 
 Small right pneumothorax has decreased.  Lung volumes are lower today.  New
 opacification at the right lung base could represent developing pneumonia. 
 Some posterior right pleural collection may be present as well.  Left lung
 volume is low but the lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 are normal.  Only one displaced right rib fracture is seen, ninth, laterally. 
 CT scanning more sensitive for detection of chest trauma.
