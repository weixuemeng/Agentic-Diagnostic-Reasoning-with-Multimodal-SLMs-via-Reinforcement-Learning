                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Acute cognitive decline, gait changes, and severe mid back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests the possibility of very small
 effusion.  There is no pleural effusion on the right.  The lungs appear clear.
 Several old right-sided rib fractures appear unchanged.  Mild degenerative
 changes are similar along mid to lower thoracic levels.  A lower thoracic
 interspace shows new moderate narrowing over the long interval suggesting
 degenerative change.  The vertebral body heights appear preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Moderate degenerative change
 along the lower thoracic spine.
