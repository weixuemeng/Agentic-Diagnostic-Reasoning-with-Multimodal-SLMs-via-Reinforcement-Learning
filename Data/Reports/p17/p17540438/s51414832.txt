                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, assess for rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm remains unchanged.  The heart size
 remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous, and mediastinal contours are
 similar.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Re-
 demonstration of a nodule within the right upper lobe is again noted measuring
 up to 13 mm.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Deformity of the left sixth lateral rib is
 compatible with a remote fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and minimal atelectasis
 in the lung bases.  Unchanged 13 mm nodule in the right upper lobe, as seen on
 prior chest CT.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated. 
 No displaced rib fractures identified.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If there is continued concern for rib fracture, consider
 a dedicated rib series.
