                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Brain mass.  Respiratory issues, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies
 the expected site of the stomach.  A left PICC line is present, tip over
 proximal/mid SVC.  
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, with atelectasis at the left base
 and equivocal minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) No significant change compared with ___.  
 2) PICC line and NG tube in satisfactory position.  
 3) Atelectasis at the left base, with minimal blunting of the costophrenic
 angle and elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Of note, however, this appearance has
 progressed compared with ___, raising the question of focus of aspiration
 or pneumonic infiltrate.
