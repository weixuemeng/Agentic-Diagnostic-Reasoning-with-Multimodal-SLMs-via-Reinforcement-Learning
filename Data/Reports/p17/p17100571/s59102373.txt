                                 FINAL REPORT
 SEMI-ERECT AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  GBM, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.2 cm above
 the carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, partially imaged, coiled in the stomach with the distal aspect
 appearing at the level of the gastric fundus, directed towards the esophagus. 
 Again, withdrawal by approximately 4-5 cm would be helpful.  There is mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace pleural
 effusion on the left would be difficult to exclude.
