                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion,
 edema, or pneumothorax.  Tiny increased density projecting over the right
 posterior rib end just to the left of midline is most likely a vessel on end
 or a tiny calcified granuloma.  No concerning pulmonary masses are identified.
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  No evidence of a pleural abnormality.  No evidence of an acute
 osseous abnormality including rib fractures on this nondedicated exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  This exam is not dedicated for imaging of the ribs.  If there is high
 concern for rib fracture, consider dedicated rib radiographs with a BB marker
 indicating area of focal pain.
