 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates heart size upper limits
 of normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears
 similar to prior study, may reflect pleural thickening or atelectasis.
 Previously described subtle right basilar opacity is less apparent on current
 examination.  No new focal opacity is seen.  There is no air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.  Previously described right
 basilar opacity on radiograph dated ___ is less apparent on
 current examination.
