                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, cough  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are lung volumes. The study is slightly underpenetrated due to body
 habitus. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The mediastinal contours are
 stable and unremarkable. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and slightly underpenetrated examination making evaluation
 slightly suboptimal. Given this, no definite acute cardiopulmonary process
 identified.
