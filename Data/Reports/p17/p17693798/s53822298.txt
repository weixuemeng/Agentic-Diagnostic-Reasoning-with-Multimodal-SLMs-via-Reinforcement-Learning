 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post heparin drip.  Increasing neck girth, questionable
 retrosternal hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left-sided
 pneumonia shows minimal signs of resolution at the left lung base but slightly
 more extensive changes in the left lung apex.  No reactive pleural effusion.
 
 The right lung continues to be normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 Known vascular stent.
 
 For evaluation of the retrocardiac space, either a lateral radiograph or CT
 should be performed.
