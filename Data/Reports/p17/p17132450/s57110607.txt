                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ct pull  // eval for ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the left chest tube is been removed.  Doubt but
 cannot entirely exclude a tiny residual left pneumothorax.  No right-sided
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Multiple additional lies and tubes been removed.  The right IJ line remains
 present, tip again seen overlying the mid right atrium.
 
 Again seen is  increased retrocardiac opacity with partial obscuration the
 left hemidiaphragm,  consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film, with sternotomy
 wires noted.
 
 At the right lung base, there is atelectasis, with probable small amount of
 pleural fluid and pleural thickening.  Subtle deformity of the of ribs along
 the lower right chest wall raises the question of old healed fractures,
 possibly with some chronic pleural thickening.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of left chest tube.  Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, a
 tiny residual left pneumothorax.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly with a small left
 effusion, similar to the prior film.
 
 Atelectasis at the right base, which may be slightly worse.  Pleural
 thickening and/or a small amount of pleural fluid at the right base.  Please
 see comment above.
 
 No right-sided pneumothorax detected.
