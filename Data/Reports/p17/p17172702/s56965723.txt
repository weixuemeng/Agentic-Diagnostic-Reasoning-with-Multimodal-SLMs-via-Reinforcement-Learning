 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are once again noted to be decreased.  The
 previously noted patchy opacities in the right lower lobe are now
 significantly less conspicuous. Moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral
 pleural effusions is unchanged.  Mild peripheral emphysema with adjacent
 scarring is again noted.  There is no pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema
 identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
