                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a better inspiration.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with some fullness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
 
 Opacification at the left base most likely represents a combination of
 atelectasis and small effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
