                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath in a patient with a recent hospitalization
 for new congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 most recent preceding study of ___.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour has decreased; however, the contour could represent
 an elevated hemidiaphragm or a subpulmonic effusion.  Lung volumes have
 increased since ___ and the lungs are clear without evidence of
 pulmonary edema, vascular congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly and the mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Compression
 fractures in the lower thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour has slightly decreased
 since ___; however, remaining contour elevation could represent
 a subpulmonic effusion or hemidiaphragmatic elevation.  Left lateral decubitus
 radiographs are recommended if differentiation between these entities is
 clinically warranted.
 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
