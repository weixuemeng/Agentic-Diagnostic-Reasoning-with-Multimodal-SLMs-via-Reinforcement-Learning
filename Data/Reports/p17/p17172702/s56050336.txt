                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF, newly diagnosed MZL variant.  //
 Please assess for acute pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Serial chest radiographs most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in the bilateral parenchymal opacities, with
 more confluent opacities in the right lung.  Appearances are consistent with
 worsening pulmonary edema although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 No pleural effusion seen.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged even
 allowing for the projection.  No pneumothorax.  A left-sided PICC line
 terminates in the proximal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval progression of the bilateral airspace opacities, right worse than
 left.
 
 A left-sided PICC line terminates in the proximal SVC.
