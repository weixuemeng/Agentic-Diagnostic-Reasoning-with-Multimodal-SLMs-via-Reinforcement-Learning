                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax in a patient status post left-sided
 thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to
 the prior study.  Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic sulcus has
 improved status post thoracentesis and elevated left hemidiaphragmatic contour
 could represent an elevated hemidiaphragm or a subpulmonic effusion.  The
 lungs are clear without evidence of vascular congestion or pneumothorax. 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. Right impaced humeral head fracture is better
 characterized on dedicated shoulder radiograph from ___. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis with no
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Elevated left hemidiaphragmatic contour could represent a subpulmonic
 effusion or true hemidiaphragmatic elevation.  Left lateral decubitus
 radiograph could differentiate between these entities.
