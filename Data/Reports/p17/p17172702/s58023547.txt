                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are decreased, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. There are increasingly prominant, patchy opacities in the right
 lower lobe, which may represent atlectasis versus pneumonia. Redemonstrated is
 moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild peripheral
 emphysema with adjacent scaring is most prominant in the right upper lobe.
 Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis is noted.  There is no pneumothorax or
 overt pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increasing patchy opacities in the RLL which may represent atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia. Recommend short term imaging followup.
 
 2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions.
