 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, dyspnea and cough.  Question left basilar pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears again mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 interstitium appears prominent to a similar extent including mild upper zone
 distribution of pulmonary vascularity.  There is no focal opacity, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings suggestive of pneumonia.  Mild interstitial
 abnormality, although not necessarily, if at all, different from baseline
 findings.
