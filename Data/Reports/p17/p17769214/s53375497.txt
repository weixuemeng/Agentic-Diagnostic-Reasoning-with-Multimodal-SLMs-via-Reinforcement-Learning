                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation for airway control in setting
 of stridor  // Evolution of congestion, atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 decreased. There is enlargement of the heart with enlargement of the bilateral
 hilar structures. Although this could in part be positional, short term
 followup should be performed to exclude centralized pulmonary edema.  No
 larger pleural effusions. The lung bases are better ventilated than on the
 previous image. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
