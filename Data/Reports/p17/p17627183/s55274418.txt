                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD  // Eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph.  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, larger on the left. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs
 are hyperexpanded. Abnormal diffuse reticular pattern of the pulmonary
 parenchyma is again noted, more pronounced in the right upper lateral lung.
 This may represent atypical pulmonary edema, with pleural effusions supporting
 this conclusion. However, normal heart size and lack of azygos distension
 argue against this conclusion. This may also represent an atypical infection
 or a interstitial process.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable in appearance.
 No acute process seen in visualized osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent diffuse reticular abnormality, which may represent atypical
 edema or atypical infection.  Interstitial lung disease is also a possibility.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Given the persistent reticular appearance of the pulmonary
 parenchyma, chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:13 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
