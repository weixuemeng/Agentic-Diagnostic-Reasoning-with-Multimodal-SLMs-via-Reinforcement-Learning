                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with type 1 diabetes.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Atelectases are present in the right lower lobe
 and left mid lung.  Increased density in the left lower hemithorax could be
 superimposition of overlying soft tissues but underlying lung abnormality
 cannot be totally excluded and repeat conventional PA and lateral views are
 recommended when feasible.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusions. 
 Surgical clips projects in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
