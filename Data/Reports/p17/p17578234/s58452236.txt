 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status, assess for

 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A right
 upper extremity PICC line is again seen with its tip residing at the level of
 the upper SVC.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen.
 There is an AICD with unchanged position and lead tips extending to the region
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is persistent cardiomegaly
 with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Hilar engorgement is unchanged.  Mediastinal contour
 is stable.  Calcification adjacent to the left of the trachea is chronic and
 could represent a calcified thyroid nodule or calcified lymph node.  Bony
 structures are intact.

 effusions also present.
