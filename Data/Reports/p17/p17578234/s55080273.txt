                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiographs same day.  Also, chest radiographs
 ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest wall pacer-defibrillator has leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires appear grossly intact. 
 The lung volumes are low.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, similar to prior studies.  There is
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Inferior
 displacement of the minor fissure suggests some volume loss in the middle
 lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increased.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 3.  Partial collapse of the right middle lobe.
