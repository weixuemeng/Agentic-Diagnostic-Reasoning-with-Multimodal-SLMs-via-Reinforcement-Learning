                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter,
 endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube appear essentially unchanged, as do
 the leads of the dual-channel pacer device.  Opacification at the left base
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe with probable pleural effusion.
