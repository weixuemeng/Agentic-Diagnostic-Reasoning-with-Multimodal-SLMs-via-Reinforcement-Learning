 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate cardiomegaly, signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 The monitoring and support devices are constant.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion, with
 subsequent areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases.
