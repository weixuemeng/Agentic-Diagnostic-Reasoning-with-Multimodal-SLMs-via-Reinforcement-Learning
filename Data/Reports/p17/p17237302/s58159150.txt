                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic cancer, status post right thoracentesis, to evaluate
 chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right pigtail catheter terminates
 in the right basal pleural space. Trace right apical pneumothorax is little
 changed. Mild reduction in the now moderate sized pleural effusion with
 decreased fissural fluid.  Heterogeneous opacities seen throughout the
 re-expanding right lung, consistent with re-expansion edema has improved. 
 Denser consolidation in the right base likely represents residual atelectasis.
 There is mild edema in the well-expanded left lung.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  A right chest wall Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC. AICD
 device with a single lead in the right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild decrease in moderate-sized pleural effusion.  The right pleural
 pigtail catheter in similar location, with a trace right pneumothorax.
 2.  Improved re-expansion right lung edema. Stable right basal atelectasis.
