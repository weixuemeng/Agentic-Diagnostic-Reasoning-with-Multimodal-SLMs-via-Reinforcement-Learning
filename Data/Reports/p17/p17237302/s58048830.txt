                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and multiple chest radiographs dating
 between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ICD and central vascular catheter remain in place, unchanged in
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with persistent
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy shown to better detail on recent CTA, which also
 demonstrated mild bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Bilateral upper and mid
 lung predominant airspace opacities have slightly improved since the recent
 chest radiograph.  A pulmonary nodule in the right infrahilar region is
 similar to the recent study, and note was made of multiple nodules on the
 prior CT.  Small right pleural effusion appears similar, but a left pleural
 effusion has apparently decreased in size in the interval.
