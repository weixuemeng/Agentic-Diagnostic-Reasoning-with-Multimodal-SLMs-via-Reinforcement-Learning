                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion, status post chest tube drain. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right pigtail catheter in the pleural space.  There is a substantial decrease
 of the pleural fluid.  However, some remnant fluid is still visible,
 particular in intrafissural location.  There is an 8 mm apicolateral
 post-procedural pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  Lung volumes have
 overall decreased.  Atelectatic changes in the retrocardiac lung area and at
 the right lung bases.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild fluid overload.  The right
 Port-A-Cath and the left pectoral pacemaker are in constant position.
