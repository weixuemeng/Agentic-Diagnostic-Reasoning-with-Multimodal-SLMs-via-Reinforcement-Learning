  Moderate cardiomegaly persists but there is interval improvement in pulmonary
  vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema seen on the study from 6.5 hours
  ago.  The new right central line cannot be well seen distally and is at least
  at the cavoatrial junction, if not within the right atrium.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CML, renal failure, evaluation for volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have slightly decreased in severity.  Mild fluid overload,
 however, is still present.  The lung volumes remain low and the cardiac
 silhouette, particular the left ventricle, continued to be enlarged.  There is
 no larger pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumonia.  Minimal retrocardiac
 atelectasis is unchanged in extent.
