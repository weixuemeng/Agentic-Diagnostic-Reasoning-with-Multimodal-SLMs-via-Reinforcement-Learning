                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear clear. 
 Blunting of the right posterior costophrenic sulcus may reflect a trace
 pleural effusion on that side only.  Mild degenerative changes are similar
 along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace right-sided pleural effusion; otherwise
 unremarkable.
