                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest examinations, lung volumes are decreased. The
 cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. There is mild tortuosity of the
 descending aorta.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There
 is mild atelectasis of the right lung base.  Mild blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles likely represent small pleural effusions.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. No acute
 cardiopulmonary findings.
