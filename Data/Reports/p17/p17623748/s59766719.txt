 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Aside from linear opacities in the
 right peripheral lower lobe likely scarring, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 evidence of pneumonia or aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild biapical pleural
 thickening consistent with scarring is unchanged.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 consistent with emphysema .
