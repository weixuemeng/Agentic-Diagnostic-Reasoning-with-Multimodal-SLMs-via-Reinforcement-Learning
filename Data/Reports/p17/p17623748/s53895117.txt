                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of esophageal cancer status
 post MIE.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Aside from the previously visualized and stable linear opacities in
 the right perihilar lower lobe consistent with scarring, the lungs are clear.
 The lungs continue to appear hyperinflated consistent with emphysema. There is
 no evidence of consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains normal.  Mild apical pleural thickening consistent with
 scarring remains unchanged.  Post-surgical changes with a neo-esophagus are
 noted and normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
