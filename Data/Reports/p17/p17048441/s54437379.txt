                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Lung volumes
 are low.  There is blunting at the left CP angle which could represent a left
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible with
 pneumonia in the setting of low lung volumes.  The heart appears mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony
 structures appear grossly intact, though cortical irregularity involving the
 subacromial space bilaterally though incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion with bibasilar linear opacities which
 most likely represent atelectasis.  Please note, pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Degenerative changes in the subacromial region bilaterally at the
 shoulders.
