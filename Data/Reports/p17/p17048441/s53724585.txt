                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with atypical pneumonia, and COPD exacerbation.
 // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the left hemi thorax is now
 nearly completely opacified, with a small amount of residual aerated lung at
 the left apex.  There has been no substantial contralateral shift of the
 cardiomediastinal contours, the suggesting this is predominantly due to near
 collapse of the left lung.  Known coexisting left pleural effusion is
 difficult to quantify in the setting of substantial atelectasis.  Within the
 right hemi thorax, a small to moderate right pleural effusion is a persistent
 finding with adjacent worsening right basilar atelectasis.
