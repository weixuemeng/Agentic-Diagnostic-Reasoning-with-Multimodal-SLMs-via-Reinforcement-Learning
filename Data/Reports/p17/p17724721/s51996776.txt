 assess for pneumonia      please assess for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality in the right lower lung is probably residual
 edema.  Heart is normal size.  Right pleural effusion is tiny, seen best on
 the lateral view.  Greater opacification at the lung bases, right greater than
 left is probably a combination of atelectasis and edema.  If symptoms persist
 I would repeat conventional chest radiographs to see if patient might be
 developing pneumonia.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal
