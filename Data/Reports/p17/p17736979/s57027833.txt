                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ALL s/p SCT and worsening O2 requirement 
 // eval for worsening pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 837
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been marked interval increase in parenchymal opacities, now seen
 diffusely throughout both lungs.  These appear predominately comprised of
 increased interstitial markings, but with areas of confluence. Small right
 pleural effusion is slightly larger. No definite left effusion. Left-sided
 line central line unchanged, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked interval increase in diffuse bilateral opacities. Time course is most
 suggestive of CHF with interstitial and probably also with some degree of
 alveolar edema. Diffuse infection or ARDS is considered less likely, but
 remains in the differential.
