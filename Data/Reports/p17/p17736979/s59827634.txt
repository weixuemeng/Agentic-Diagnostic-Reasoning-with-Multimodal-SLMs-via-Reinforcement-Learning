                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and cough, question
 consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:05.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 7:14 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval repositioning of the left subclavian PICC line which now has its tip
 near the cavoatrial junction.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable.  There are bibasilar airspace opacities, which may reflect
 aspiration or pneumonia given the current clinical setting; however, as the
 pulmonary vasculature appears ill-defined, this also could reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  Therefore, clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusions are appreciated.
