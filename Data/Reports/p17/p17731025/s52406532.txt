                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear airspace opacities in the right lower lung are suggestive of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacification may
 represent atelectasis in the setting of an elevated left hemidiaphragm or
 developing consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema common pneumothorax, or
 pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The descending
 aorta is tortuous.  Hyperinflation suggests COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities may represent atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes or developing consolidation, depending upon the clinical setting.
