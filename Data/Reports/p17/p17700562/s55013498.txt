                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is irregular potentially interstitial opacity along the
 periphery of the left lateral lung on the frontal view which is not clearly
 identified on the lateral.  There is possible tethering of the left hilum
 towards the periphery.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of prominent
 extrapleural fat lateral to this opacity.  While infection is not excluded,
 this is an unusual presentation for pneumonia.  This could also be a
 pleural-based scar or peripheral subpleural interstitial fibrosis.  The right
 lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unusual left lateral peripheral interstitial opacity.  This could
 be pleural-based scarring or other pleural-based abnormality or peripheral
 interstitial abnormality.  While infection is not completely excluded, this is
 an unusual appearance for a typical pneumonia.  Recommend a CT of the chest
 with contrast for further characterization.
 
 Results were emailed to the ED QA nurses on ___ by Dr. ___, as the
 patient had been discharged by the time the findings were communicated with
 the ED resident.
