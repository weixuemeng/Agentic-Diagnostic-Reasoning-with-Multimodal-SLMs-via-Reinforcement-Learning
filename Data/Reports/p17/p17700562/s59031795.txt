                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Mild dyspnea and abnormal chest radiograph in
 ___, re-assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Previously demonstrated
 multifocal consolidations have resolved consistent with most likely resolution
 of infectious process. Within the limitations of the chest radiograph
 technique, no current abnormalities demonstrated.  The prevascular soft tissue
 lesion seen on the prior CT should be further assessed with chest CT in three
 months as previously recommended since it cannot be assessed on the chest
 radiograph.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
