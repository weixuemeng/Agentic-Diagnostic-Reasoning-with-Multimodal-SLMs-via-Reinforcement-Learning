 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post surgical hardware removal.  Assessment for PICC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided PICC line has been
 minimally pulled back.  The tip of the PICC line, however, is still in the mid
 SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  No
 acute lung changes.  No pleural effusions.
