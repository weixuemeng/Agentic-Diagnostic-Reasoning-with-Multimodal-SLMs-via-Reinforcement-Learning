                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dysphagia following cervical spine surgery
 and low-grade fever.  Evaluate for evidence of aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A right PICC has been removed.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is
 increased opacity laterally in the left mid lung, which likely reflects soft
 tissue artifact secondary to rotation.  However, more medially at the left
 infrahilar region there are ill-defined opacities that appear increased from
 prior study and are concerning for aspiration.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest lobar pneumonia. 
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 edema.  There is no free air in the upper abdomen, and there is no acute
 osseous abnormality identified.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined left infrahilar opacities could relate to aspiration.
