                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F primary hyperparathyroidism s/p neck exploration,
 parathryoidectomy x1, w/ chest pain tachycardia  // eval for intrathoracic
 process, stat order     eval for intrathoracic process, stat order
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the air are lower lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence
 of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Opacification at the left base
 most likely represents postoperative atelectatic changes.
 The area of increased opacification in the right supraclavicular regions
 suggested previously is no longer seen, implying that it was external to the
 patient on the previous study.
