                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dementia and and tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs
 are mildly hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles on the posterior view suggests
 trace bilateral pleural effusions. Somewhat linear appearing opacity within
 the left mid lung field may reflect atelectasis. Mild prominence of the
 interstitial markings could suggest mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There
 is a remote displaced fracture of the sternum as well as a compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body.  High riding right humeral head is
 demonstrated compatible with rotator cuff disease, and widening of the right
 AC joint likely reflects a previous injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate. Remote fracture of the sternum.
