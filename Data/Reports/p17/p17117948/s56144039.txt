                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NGT placement which was dislodged and
 advanced.  // please evaluate location of NGT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Single AP view of the chest.  2 separate images were obtained to
 include the distal NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the
 upper stomach.  The sideport overlies the gastric fundus, likely immediately
 distal to the GE junction.
 
 The ET tube has been removed.
 
 Left IJ central line tip overlies the cavoatrial junction, similar to prior.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Mild crowding of vessels about the left-greater-than-right superior hila is
 again noted.  Probable subsegmental atelectasis at the right base medially.
 
 Retrocardiac could at retrocardiac density this appears slightly improved
 compared with the prior film.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 .
 
 Incidental note made of bilateral cervical ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip overlies the stomach.  Sideport probably lies immediately distal
 to the GE junction.  Clinical correlation regarding possible advancement is
 requested.
 
 Interval improvement in retrocardiac density, though retrocardiac density
 persists.
 
 Mild crowding of bronchovascular markings about the hila, similar to prior.
 Probable atelectasis at the right base medially.
 
 Incidental note made of prominent bilateral C7 cervical ribs.
