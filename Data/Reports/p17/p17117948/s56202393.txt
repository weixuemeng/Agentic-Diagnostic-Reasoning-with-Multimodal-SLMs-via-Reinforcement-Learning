                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of systolic CHF, DM1, renal
 failure, intubated due following episode of unresponsiveness, with acute
 desaturation  // please evaluate for ET tube placement, pneumothorax,
 infiltrate, or pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size top normal enlarged when compared to ___ study.  The
 mediastinal and pleural contours are unremarkable.  A right lower lung opacity
 is seen suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 obscured from a small pleural effusion and volume loss of the left lower lobe
 secondary to atelectasis.  Support devices are unchanged in position with the
 ETT terminating approximately 5.8 cm superior to the carina and the left
 jugular CVC terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Asymmetric pulmonary edema predominantly in the right lung.
 2. Stable small left pleural effusion with increased atelectasis of the left
 lower lung.
