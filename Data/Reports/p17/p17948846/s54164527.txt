                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation. Evaluate positioning of the endotracheal
 tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 4 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the
 field of view. A new retrocardiac opacity is present, and may represent
 atelectasis.  There may be a component of a small left pleural effusion. 
 There is no right pleural effusion.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is
 no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The
 heart is mildly enlarged, and unchanged. A left-sided cardiac device and its
 wires are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube.
 2. New retrocardiac opacity, which is presumably atelectasis. Aspiration or
 pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  There may be a tiny left pleural
 effusion.  Attention on followup radiographs is recommended.
