                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RLL opacity  // r/o pneumonia vs edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is accompanied
 by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.  Previously present peripheral
 right lower lobe opacity is now contiguous with larger areas of heterogeneous
 opacification in the right mid and lower lung, as well as patchy left
 infrahilar opacification.  These findings are concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
