                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath and congestive heart
 failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Persistent mild pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated, not substantially changed from the previous exam. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions appear new in the interval.  Mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  While there is persistent patchy right basilar
 opacification, including a more peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the right
 lower lobe, overall these findings have minimally improved in the interval,
 particularly within the right perihilar region.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Degenerative changes are again noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema, similar to the previous exam, with new small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Persistent peripheral wedge-shaped opacity within the right lower lobe,
 potentially an area of infarction or persistent/ continued infection.
 3. Other previously described multifocal airspace opacities within the right
 lung and left infrahilar region have improved, and may reflect areas of
 improving infection.
