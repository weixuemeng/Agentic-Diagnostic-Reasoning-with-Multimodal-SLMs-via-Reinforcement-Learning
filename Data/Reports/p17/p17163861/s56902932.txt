 weakness, please evaluate for cardiopulmonary change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation or effusion.  There is a dominant nodule in
 the left perihilar region measuring approximately 2.3 cm.  Additional smaller
 nodules project over the bilateral lung apices.  Given history of prior
 malignancy, underlying metastases would be of concern.  Nonurgent chest CT is
 suggested to further evaluate.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is seen as well as median
 sternotomy wires.  Chronic deformity of the proximal left humerus suggests
 prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease.  Nonurgent
 chest CT is suggested to further evaluate.
