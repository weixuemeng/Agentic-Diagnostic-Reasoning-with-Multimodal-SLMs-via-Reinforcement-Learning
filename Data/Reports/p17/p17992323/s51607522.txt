                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, there is a new dense opacity in the posterior left lower
 lobe, most consistent with pneumonia. It is difficult to exclude a small
 amount of pleural fluid on the left.  A hazy linear opacity on the right may
 represent atelectasis or second focus of pneumonia. There is no right pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe pneumonia and possible new subtle right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
