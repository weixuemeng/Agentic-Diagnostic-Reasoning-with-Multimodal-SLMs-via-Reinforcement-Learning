 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided nerve stimulating device remains in place.  There has been
 interval removal of the right chest tube, where there is a stable small right
 apical pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities in the retrocardiac region as well as
 in the right upper and lower lung are likely unchanged given differences in
 technique.  No pleural effusions are seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
