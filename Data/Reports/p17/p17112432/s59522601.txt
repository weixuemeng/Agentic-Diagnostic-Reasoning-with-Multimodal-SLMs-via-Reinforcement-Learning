                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT and chest radiographs dating between ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a small right
 apicolateral pneumothorax which has minimally decreased in size since the
 recent study.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities in the right lung appear
 unchanged allowing for differences in lung volumes, and multiple right rib
 fractures are again demonstrated.  Within the left lung, an area of patchy
 opacity in the retrocardiac region has slightly worsened.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight decrease in small right apical pneumothorax with chest tube in
 place.
 2.  Multifocal right-sided pulmonary opacities consistent with contusion in
 the setting of recent rib fractures.  Coexisting laceration injury seen to
 better detail on recent CT.
