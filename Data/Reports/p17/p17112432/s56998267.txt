                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 13:20
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post ___ with right pneumothorax,
 pulled chest tube yesterday, question stable pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 17:43.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 13:20 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nerve stimulating device is seen overlying the lateral left upper lung. 
 Right apical pneumothorax appears stable.  Patchy opacities in the right upper
 lobe in the right mid and lower lung are unchanged, which could reflect
 resolving contusions, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  The
 left lung is essentially clear with the exception of a linear opacity in the
 retrocardiac region which may represent an area of subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Multiple
 right-sided rib fractures with associated pleural thickening are again noted.
