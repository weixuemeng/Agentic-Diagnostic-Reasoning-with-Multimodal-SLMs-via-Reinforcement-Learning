 ADDENDUM  The dictation for this patient was not transcribed.
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is increased
 opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with lower lobe
 pneumonia. This is not definitely appreciated on the frontal view.
