 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:46 PM
  Interval left-sided thoracentesis with associated decrease in left-sided
  pleural effusion.  Residual left lower lobe lung opacification likely
  represents combination of trace effusion and atelectasis though infectious
  process not excluded.  No pneumothorax evident though a tiny apical
  pneumothorax could be obscured by patient head position.  The remainder exam
  is unchanged.  Findings d/ Dr ___ at 8pm via telephone on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post thoracentesis for left pleural
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph shows improved clarity at the
 left lung base compared to yesterday's upright exam.  The hemidiaphragm is now
 visible, suggesting significant decrease in fluid status post thoracentesis
 and no pneumothorax is seen.  Mild, streaky interstitial opacities seen in
 both upper lobes and the right lung base.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 tortuous and calcified, and the upper end of an expanded abdominal aortic
 stent is seen at the lower border of the film.  Cardiac size is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pneumothorax status post left thoracentesis with improved
 clarity at left lung base.
