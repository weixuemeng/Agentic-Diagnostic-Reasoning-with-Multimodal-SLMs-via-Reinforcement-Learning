 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for progression of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the relatively large lung
 volumes and areas of pleural thickening bilaterally, combined to a calcified
 left upper granuloma and a scar at the left lung bases are constant.  Normal
 cardiac silhouette but the area of atelectasis and parenchymal opacity, likely
 atelectatic, projecting over the left costophrenic sinus, that is also blunted
 by a small pleural effusion.  Effusion is better evaluated on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph.  The right PICC line is in unchanged position.
