                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and no localizing symptoms.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged, and there
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small left pleural effusion appears
 slightly increased in size compared to the prior exam, and a trace right
 pleural effusion appears unchanged.  Two peripheral nodular opacities within
 the left upper lobe appear similar, and the previously described right upper
 lobe nodule seen on chest CT is not clearly noted on the current exam.  Left
 basilar compressive atelectasis is noted.  There is scarring within the lung
 apices.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the midline upper abdomen. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Slight interval increase in size of small left pleural effusion and
 unchanged trace right pleural effusion.  Left basilar compressive atelectasis.
 
 
 2. Relatively unchanged appearance of 2 nodular opacities in left upper lobe,
 likely inflammatory or infectious in etiology.
 
 3. Previously noted right upper lobe pulmonary nodule seen on CT is not
 visualized on the current exam.
