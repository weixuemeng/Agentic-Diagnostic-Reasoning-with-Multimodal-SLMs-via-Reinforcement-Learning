                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea x 3 days.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There has
 been interval increase in left basal opacity which likely reflects a
 combination of a moderate-sized joint effusion with basilar consolidation
 which could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  At the right lung base,
 there is mild atelectasis and a moderate pleural effusion which is increased
 from prior exam.  Pulmonary interstitial edema persists.  The heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are intact.  No definite signs of free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Clips are seen in the upper abdominal
 midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right, with bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely
 atelectasis though cannot exclude infection.  Mild pulmonary interstitial
 edema persists.
