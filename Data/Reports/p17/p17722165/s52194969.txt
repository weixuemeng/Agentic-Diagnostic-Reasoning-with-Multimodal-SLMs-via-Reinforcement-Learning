                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, enteric
 catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter with remaining right-sided central venous
 sheath terminating likely at the confluence of the right internal jugular and
 subclavian veins.  Left-sided mediastinal and chest tube drains have been
 removed without development of pneumothorax.  There is persistent but notably
 improved pulmonary edema with residual bibasilar opacifications likely
 representing atelectasis.  No pleural effusions identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Improved pulmonary edema.
