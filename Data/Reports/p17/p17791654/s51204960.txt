                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with palpitations
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and lumbar spine radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right right ventricle, unchanged. Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery, possibly suggestive of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension. Linear opacity within the right lung base likely
 reflects an area of subsegmental atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are new in the interval. Minimal bibasilar streaky opacities may
 reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities. Compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction
 appears compared to the prior lumbar spine radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and streaky bibasilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis. Infection in the left lung base is not completely excluded.
