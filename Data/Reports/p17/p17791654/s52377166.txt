                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably unchanged.  Superimposed on background volume loss and
 band-like opacity in the posterior left lower lobe is increased volume loss
 and hazy opacity superimposed upon prior findings at the left lung base.  A
 trace pleural effusion is also difficult to exclude on the left but not
 definitely present.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased volume loss in opacity at the left lung base. Whether this may
 represent developing pneumonia or worsening atelectasis superimposed on
 chronic scarring is uncertain and should be correlated with clinical findings.
