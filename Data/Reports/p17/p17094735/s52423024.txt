                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are correlated to CT scan
 performed the same day.
 
 The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Increased opacity is
 identified at the lung bases on the lateral.  However, these areas are grossly
 clear on CT scan, therefore is likely due to atelectasis.  Costophrenic angles
 are sharp.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged for technique.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
