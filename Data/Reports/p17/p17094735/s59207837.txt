  or pneumothorax.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 7:02 PM
  ETT tip 3.2 cm above carina. RIJ CVL tip in mid SVC. Left sided libe upper
  SVC. NGT courses through stomach and out of view. Improved right lung aeration
  with persistent moderate right effusion and likely right basal atelectasis.
  Volume loss and opacities in the left lung, likely atelectasis. Moderate left
  pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation and decreased extent of the pre-existing basal bilateral
 opacities.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of
 normal, the relatively large pulmonary vessels could indicate mild fluid
 overload.  No larger pleural effusions.  No newly appeared parenchymal
 changes.
