                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Worsening oxygen requirement.  Patient with AMS.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly and appearance of the hila bilateral is unchanged.  There are
 lower lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature in the lower lobes
 bilaterally.  Hazy opacity in the left lower perihilar region could represent
 aspiration.  Followup is recommended.
