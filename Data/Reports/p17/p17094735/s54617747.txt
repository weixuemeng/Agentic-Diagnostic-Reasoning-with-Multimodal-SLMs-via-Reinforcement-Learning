                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with mental status changes, for NG
 placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left hemidiaphragm is now
 quite sharply seen.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some
 indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels suggests elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
 
 The nasogastric tube can be followed to the upper stomach, where it passes
 below the lower margin of the image.  To determine the precise position of the
 tip, an abdomen image would be necessary.
