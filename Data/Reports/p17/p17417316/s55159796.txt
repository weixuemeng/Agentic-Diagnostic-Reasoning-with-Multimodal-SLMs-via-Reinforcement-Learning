                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and history of breast cancer, suspected
 pulmonary lesions.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  No change since the prior study is demonstrated as
 well as there is no change in slightly tortuous ascending aorta and aortic
 arch.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Questionable irregularity along the left
 cardiac border, most likely represent fat pad, but given patient history,
 assessment of the chest CT should be considered.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
