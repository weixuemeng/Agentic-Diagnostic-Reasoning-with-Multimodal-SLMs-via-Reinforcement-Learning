                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ PVD multiple vascular procedures s/p thoracentesis for
 pleural effusion several days ago now with slowly progressive pulmonary
 symptoms (cough, mild SOB, O2 requirement)  // question increase in effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Even allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears enlarged, but similar to the prior study.
 
 There is diffuse vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
 There is patchy opacity in the right mid and lower zones.  A right pleural
 effusion is again seen,  possibly slightly smaller.  There is underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung base.
 
 There is atelectasis at left lung base and increased retrocardiac density,
 unchanged.  No left pleural effusion.
 
 Right PICC line tip overlies distal SVC near cavoatrial junction, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly unchanged.
 
 CHF with interstitial and possible scattered pulmonary edema, overall similar
 to the prior study.
 
 Small right effusion may be slightly smaller.  There is persistent underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation and probable small right effusion.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, essentially unchanged.
