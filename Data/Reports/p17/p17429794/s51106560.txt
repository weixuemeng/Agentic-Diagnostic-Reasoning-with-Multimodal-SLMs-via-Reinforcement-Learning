                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased SOB  // pulm edema/ effusion     
 pulm edema/ effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 16:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the
 distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction 5 cm below the carina.  Interval removal
 of the left subclavian PICC line.  There is circumferential right pleural
 opacity with substantial volume loss of the right lung which most likely
 reflects an enlarging pleural effusion or hemorrhage with partial collapse of
 the right middle and lower lobes.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac mediastinal contours are difficult to
 assess due to the right sided opacification.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 prominent but there is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
