                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R pleural effusion  // compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior studies including ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right pleural effusion is more pronounced than on the earlier study and
 obscures observation of the right base, and it would be difficult to exclude
 consolidation/ atelectasis in this region.
 There is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular
 detail suggesting CHF.  There is no pneumothorax.  The PICC line on the right
 is unchanged.
