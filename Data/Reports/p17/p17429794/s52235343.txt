 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF p/w severe volume overload  // Had R
 sided pleural effusion on previous CXR, want to follow-up and see if it is

 want to follow-up and see if it is diminishing with diuresis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little change in the degree
 of right pleural effusion.  Silhouetting of the right heart border suggests
 some volume loss in the mid right middle as well as lower lobe.  The right
 subclavian PICC line has been removed.
 The left lung remains essentially clear.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
