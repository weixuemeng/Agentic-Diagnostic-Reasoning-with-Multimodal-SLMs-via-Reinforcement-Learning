 likely external.  Minimal linear density on the frontal projection in the left
 midlung and right lower lung could represent focal areas of platelike
 atelectasis.  There is no definite consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is tortuous and atherosclerotic calcifications are present.  The
 heart size appears within normal limits.  No bony abnormalities are detected.
