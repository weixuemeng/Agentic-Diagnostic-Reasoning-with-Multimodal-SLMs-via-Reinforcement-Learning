                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and areas of left base
 scarring suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.  The
 patient is rotated to the right.  New since the prior study, there is right
 basilar opacity, raising concern for infection or aspiration.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is slight
 blunting of the costophrenic angles which may relate to the hyperinflated
 lungs and basilar scarring without definite pleural effusion seen.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right base opacity raises concern for consolidation, possibly due to
 infection or aspiration.
 2.  Chronic changes of COPD/pulmonary emphysema.
