                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CABG and mitral valve replacement, evaluate for Dobbhoff tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff feeding tube is in the distal esophagus at the GE
 junction and should be advanced.  Note that the lung apices are excluded from
 this film.  A right PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  There is new
 opacity in the right lower lobe which likely represent layering effusion. 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities are stable.  The heart size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Dobbhoff tube is in the distal esophagus and should be advanced.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
