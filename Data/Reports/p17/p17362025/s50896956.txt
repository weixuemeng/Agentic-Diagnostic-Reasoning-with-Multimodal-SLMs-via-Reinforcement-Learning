 HISTORY:  Left-sided rib pain after being struck by a at.

 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is mild right
 base atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  If clinical concern for rib fracture remains
 high, consider dedicated rib series.
