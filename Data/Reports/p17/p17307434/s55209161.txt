                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status with rales at right lung base.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Areas of chronic
 changes/scarring are seen, including the right mid lung and bibasilar regions.
 Basilar opacities are most likely due to atelectasis and/or scarring; however,
 an early consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 There is severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body and likely
 moderate compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age
 but may be old.  Correlate clinically for acuity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD and likely chronic lung changes.  Bibasilar opacities are
 most likely due to atelectasis/scarring, although an early consolidation due
 to infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  
 
 Severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body and moderate-to-severe
 compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age, but may
 be chronic.  Correlate clinically for acuity.
