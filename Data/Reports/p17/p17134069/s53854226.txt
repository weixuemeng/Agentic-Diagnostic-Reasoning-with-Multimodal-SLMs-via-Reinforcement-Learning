 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:08 PM
  Persistent cardiomegaly, most likely effusion given patient's history but
  indeterminate on radiography. Small left pleural effusion increased. New left
  retrocardiac density likely atelectasis given timing of development and abrupt
  termination of proximal air bronchograms, but aspiration is also a
  consideration. Interval placement of left sided chest tube. No pneumothorax
  detected.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:18 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pericardial window.  Check chest tube position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 New left pleural tube ends at the apex of the hemithorax.  Pneumothorax is
 tiny.  There is at least a small left pleural effusion.  Opacification at the
 base of the left chest is probably a combination of pleural effusion and new
 left lower lobe atelectasis.  Lung volumes are generally lower, and there may
 be early pulmonary edema.  Large cardiac silhouette is slightly smaller, given
 the AP projection and lower lung volumes compared to the size on ___
 conventional chest radiographs.  There is a suggestion of a small amount of
 air in the pericardium, which would not be surprising given the recent
 surgery.  It shows thickening of the pericardium lateral to the right atrium.
