                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with two-week history of cough, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show no focal
 parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but stable.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent but unchanged, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta. 
 The hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild separation of the uppermost
 three sternal wire sutures is unchanged and alignment is intact.  Epicardial
 wires are still in place extending superficially and out of view on the
 lateral radiograph.  No retrosternal collection or fragmentation of sternal
 wires is seen to suggest active infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Mild cardiomegaly stable since
 at least  ___.
