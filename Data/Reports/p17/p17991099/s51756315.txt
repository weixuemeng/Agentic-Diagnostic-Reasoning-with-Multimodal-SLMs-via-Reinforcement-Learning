                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD, increased shortness of
 breath, evaluate for new focal abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral view.  There is mild cardiac enlargement. 
 Relative prominence of the left ventricular contour is noted, but no typical
 configurational abnormalities are identified.  The thoracic aorta is
 moderately widened and elongated, and calcium deposits are seen in the wall
 mostly at the level of the arch.  No local contour abnormality is present. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The appearance of the vasculature
 with irregular distribution in the periphery and areas of increased
 translucency is compatible with chronic COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates
 cannot be identified, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Posterior pleural
 sinuses are well seen on the lateral view and no fluid accumulation is
 identified.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
 
 There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  General findings compatible with COPD, no evidence of new acute
 infiltrate.
