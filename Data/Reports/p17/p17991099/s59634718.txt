 The heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable with calcification of the aortic arch again noted.  The hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema or focal consolidation is demonstrated. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Attenuation of the pulmonary
 vasculature towards the apices may reflect emphysema. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
