                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IBD associated interstitial lung disease p/w
 flu, pna, now s/p intubation  // please evaluate ET tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph from earlier today, the patient has been intubated,
 with tip of tube terminating 4.7 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is
 been placed, terminating in the distal stomach.  Allowing for lower lung
 volumes on the current radiograph, there has not been appreciable change in
 the appearance of the chest since the prior study of earlier today.
