 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___.
 
 Decrease in lung volumes over night and the increase in generalized
 interstitial abnormality, largely due to fibrosing interstitial lung disease,
 could be due to either a decrease in positive pressure ventilator support or
 return of concurrent pulmonary edema.  The consolidation in the axillary
 region of the left lung is probably resolving pneumonia.
 
 Left pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Indwelling
 cardiopulmonary support devices are in standard placements respectively.  No
 pneumothorax.
