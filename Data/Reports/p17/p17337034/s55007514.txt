  ETT is 5 cm above the carina. NG in the stomach. PA catheter is probably in
  the right lower lobe pulmonary artery and should be pulled back by 2 cm for
  optimal placement. Left chest tube and mediastinal drain noted. Left
  infrahilar opacity could represent atelectasis or consolidation.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the preoperative study ___ ___, there are intact midline
 sternal wires following cardiac surgery.  The endo tracheal tube tip lies
 about 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach and a
 right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the lower lobe branch of the right
 pulmonary artery. It could be pulled back about 2 cm for optimal placement.
 Left chest tube is in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Areas of
 opacification in the left mid and lower zones most likely reflect regions of
 atelectasis.
