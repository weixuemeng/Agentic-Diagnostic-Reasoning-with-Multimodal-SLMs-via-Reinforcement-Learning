                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Reported pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and more remote exams dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  While the patient always has had some prominence of his vasculature
 in the right hemithorax, on today's exam it appears to be more consolidative
 than on the prior exams.  In addition, near the costophrenic angle on the
 frontal view, there is a halo-like opacity with a central clearing.  The left
 lung is clear.  Calcifications of the aortic knob are stable.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple prior studies demonstrate increased bronchovascular
 markings in the right hemithorax, but on today's exam these appear to be
 slightly more consolidative.  In addition, there is a new halo-like opacity
 near the costophrenic angle which is worrisome for possible cavitation. 
 Overall, these findings are concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
