                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS  // ?PNA      ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at the left base, most likely related to pleural fluid volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
 Otherwise little change.
