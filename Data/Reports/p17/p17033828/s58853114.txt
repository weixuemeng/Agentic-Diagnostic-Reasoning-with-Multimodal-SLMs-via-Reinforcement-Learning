 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:10 AM
  Due to low lung volumes and portable supine technique, the left lung base
  cannot be evaluated on this study.  If further evaluation of the posterior
  left lung base is desired, upright frontal and lateral chest radiographs are

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with consolidation on lumbar spine CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  Lumbar spine CT and chest x-ray from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Left chest wall single lead pacing device
 is again seen.  Low lung volumes noted on the current exam with linear
 opacities at the left mid to lower lung.  There is also crowding of
 bronchovascular markings likely due to lower lung volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left mid to lower lung opacities potentially due to atelectasis although
 underlying infection is also possible.  Consider repeat PA and lateral views
 to better characterize if patient is amenable.
