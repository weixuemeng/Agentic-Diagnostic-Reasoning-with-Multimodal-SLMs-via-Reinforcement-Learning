                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain after a fall.  Evaluate for traumatic
 injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations, there is no
 focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal, likely exaggerated by the low lung volumes.  There is no evidence of a
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
