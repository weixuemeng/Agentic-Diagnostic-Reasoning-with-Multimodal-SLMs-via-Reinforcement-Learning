                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___, ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As also seen on multiple prior studies, there is marked elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There is likely a small to moderate right pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis, difficult to exclude right basilar consolidation. The
 left lung is grossly clear. No left pleural effusion is seen. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 Hilar contours are stable. Subtle chronic biapical and perihilar fibrotic
 disease, similar to prior.
