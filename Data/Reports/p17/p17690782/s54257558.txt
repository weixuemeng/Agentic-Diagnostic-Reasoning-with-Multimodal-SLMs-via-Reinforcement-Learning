                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fluid overload and anemia requiring transfusion. 
 Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  It is
 difficult to ascertain on this study whether obscuration of the posterior
 portion of the right hemidiaphragm is due to a pleural effusion or
 atelectasis. Increased prominence of interstitial markings, on a background of
 chronic lung disease consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Linear opacity in
 the right lung likely represents fluid in the fissure.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and stable.  The
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  It is difficult to
 differentiate whether obscuration of the posterior margin of the right
 hemidiaphragm is due to atelectasis or pleural effusion.  Recommend a
 decubitus film for further evaluation.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Chronic interstitial lung disease.
