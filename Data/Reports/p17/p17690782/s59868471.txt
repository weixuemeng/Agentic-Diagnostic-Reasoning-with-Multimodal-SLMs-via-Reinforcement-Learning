                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with crackles, egophony at right base.
 Evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP chest
 examination ___ ___.
 
 Right-sided diaphragmatic elevation persists and appears unchanged. 
 Significant cardiac enlargement as before.  Configuration includes prominence
 of main pulmonary artery and consistent with previously diagnosed pulmonary
 hypertension.  We on previous portable chest examination suspected right-sided
 pleural effusion with blunted right-sided lateral pleural sinuses confirmed as
 the present lateral view demonstrates rather extensive pleural densities
 reaching into the posterior pleural sinus.  The left-sided pleural space
 remains free.  There is no evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical area on
 either side.  Comparison with the PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The at that time existing pulmonary congestive vascular pattern does
 not exist anymore.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right-sided diaphragmatic elevation with evidence of
 pleural effusion.  As recommended on previous portable chest examination, a
 decubitus film may be helpful to assess more precisely the magnitude of
 pleural effusion and reveal possible right lower lobe atelectasis or
 infiltrate.
