 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sarcoid, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of bilateral apical and perihilar fibrotic lung disease.  There also is
 unchanged cardiomegaly with slightly increased diameters of the pulmonary
 arteries, notably on the left.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sinuses
 suggestive of a small pleural effusion.  The vascular diameters are at the
 upper range of normal, potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.
