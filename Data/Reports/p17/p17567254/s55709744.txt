                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question right ptosis with normal chest exam, question chest lesion
 or cause of Horner syndrome.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There are good inspiratory volumes.  The heart is not enlarged.  Within the
 limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
 detected.  No apical mass is identified.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  Possible minimal atelectasis in the right
 cardiophrenic region. Slight asymmetry in the soft tissues of the right neck
 and supraclavicular region is noted, but may be accentuated due to difference
 in the position of the arms.  Minimal degenerative spurring in the mid
 thoracic spine is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic findings to account for the physical findings. 
 If there is continued concern for subtle mediastinal/hilar pathology, then CT
 could help for further assessment.
