                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Found down.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph obtained at an outside hospital on ___ at 11:01.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 3.8
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses in the left mid hemithorax.  This
 may due to deviation of the esophagus, though could be in the left main stem
 bronchus and into a posterior left lower lobe bronchi.
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax in this patient status
 post left pneumonectomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is deviated
 leftward.  A component of consolidation or fluid is difficult to exclude.  The
 right lung is clear without a consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no definite left
 pneumothorax.  Old rib deformities are noted on the left which may relate to a
 prior procedure.  They appear well corticated.  No definite acute fractures
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Complete opacification of the left hemithorax status post pneumonectomy.  
 2.  Uncertain positioning of the enteric tube.  It may be in a deviated
 esophagus, though could be in the left main stem bronchus.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ Dr. ___ at 1:05 p.m. on
 ___ via telephone by Dr. ___.  At the time these findings were discussed,
 the enteric tube had been pulled.
