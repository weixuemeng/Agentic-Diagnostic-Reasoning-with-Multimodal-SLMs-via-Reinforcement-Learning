                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sarcoidosis, now with increased dyspnea, here to
 evaluate for progression of pulmonary sarcoid or acute CHF exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated ___ and chest radiograph,
 last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased nodular opacities scattered throughout both
 lungs, greater on the right than the left with a basilar predominance,
 compatible with progression of sarcoidosis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The heart is top normal in size.  The hilar
 contours are top normal without evidence of large lymphadenopathy.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased nodular opacities throughout both lungs compatible with
 progression of sarcoidosis.  No evidence of large lymphadenopathy.
