                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sarcoidosis, presenting with three days of dyspnea,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse micronodular opacities are again seen within the lungs
 compatible with history of sarcoidosis.  There is mild linear density at the
 right lung base which likely represents scarring.  No large effusion is seen.
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the lungs with diffuse tiny nodular
 opacities compatible with sarcoidosis.  Mild right basal linear density is
 likely scarring or atelectasis.
