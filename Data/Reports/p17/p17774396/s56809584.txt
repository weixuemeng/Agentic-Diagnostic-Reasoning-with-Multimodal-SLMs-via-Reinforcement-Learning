 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Again seen is a slight

 significance.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilum, and pleural surfaces
 are normal.  There is mild scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Right basilar opacity likely not of clinical significance. 
 Unremarkable chest radiograph.
