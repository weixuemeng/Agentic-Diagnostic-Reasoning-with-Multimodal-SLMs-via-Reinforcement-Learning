                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after lung biopsy and seed
 placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to the
 CT interventional procedure obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The known left upper lobe
 lesion is re-demonstrated with a fiducial marker in place. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax on the current examination after the procedure.  No
 immediate post-procedure complications are currently noted.
