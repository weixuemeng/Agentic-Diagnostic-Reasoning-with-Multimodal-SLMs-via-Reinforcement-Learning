                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Again there is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the aortic knob. Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Surgical clip is again associated with unchanged left upper
 lobe opacity which is partially obscured by overlying cardiac lead on the
 current exam.  There is trace bibasilar atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise
 clear. There is no fluid overload.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
