                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently described focal left lower lobe opacity has rapidly
 improved.  However, there is now a more diffuse reticular pattern present with
 mid and lower lung predominance, and accompanying bronchial wall
 thickening/peribronchial cuffing.  Focal left upper lobe lung nodule with
 adjacent fiducial seed appears similar to the recent radiograph, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable as well.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Rapid resolution of focal left lower lobe opacity favoring atelectasis or
 aspiration as the likely etiology.  
 
 2.  Subtle bilateral mid and lower lung reticular opacities, for which the
 differential diagnosis includes evolving atypical pneumonia, interstitial
 edema, and drug reaction.
