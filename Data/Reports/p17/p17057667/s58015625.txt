                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // eval for ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, increased
 compared to the prior study, consistent with patient's known diffuse
 interstitial fibrotic lung disease raising concern for worsening of the
 interstitial lung disease with possible superimposed vascular congestion.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.  Aortic knob calcification is re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsened diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally in this patient
 with known history of diffuse fibrotic interstitial lung disease, concerning
 for progression of interstitial lung disease and/or possible superimposed
 vascular congestion.
