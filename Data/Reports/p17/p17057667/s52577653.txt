                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ is a ___ year old female with history of ILD
 (fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia), prior MI, HLD, HTN, Diabetes
 Mellitus, LBP, and GERD, who presented for 3 day history of neck swelling and
 hoarseness in the setting of 4-weeks of prednisone use, imaging significant
 for pneumomediastinum.  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, diffuse pneumomediastinum extending
 into the cervical region is a persistent finding.  There is likely a very
 small left apical pneumothorax.  Widespread fibrotic interstitial lung disease
 is again demonstrated as well as increasing confluence of opacification in the
 left perihilar and retrocardiac regions, potentially due to developing
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  No other relevant changes
 since recent study.
