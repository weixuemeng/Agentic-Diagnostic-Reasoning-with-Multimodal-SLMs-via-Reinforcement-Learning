                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent, distribution,
 and severity of the pre-existing interstitial changes have increased.  As a
 consequence, the lung volumes have decreased.  Increase is particularly
 obvious at both lung bases and at the level of the left hemithorax. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No other relevant changes.
