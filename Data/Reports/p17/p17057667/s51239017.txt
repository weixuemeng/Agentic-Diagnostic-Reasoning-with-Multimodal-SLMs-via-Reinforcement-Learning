                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, and there is bilateral interstitial prominence.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.  No focal consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.  Calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly and interstitial opacities compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Less likely, this could represent chronic lung disease, and
 correlation with EKG and cardiac enzymes is recommended.
