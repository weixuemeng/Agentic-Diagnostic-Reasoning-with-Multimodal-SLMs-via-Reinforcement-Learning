                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with crepitus and voice changes concern for
 esophageal/ bronchial tree injury/pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval development of pneumomediastinum with air tracking
 into the fascia planes of the neck.  No large pneumothorax is identified. 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Coarse
 diffuse interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally compatible with known
 fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease.  Increased opacities at the lung
 bases likely rib reflect superimposed atelectasis.  No new large pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema is definitively present.  Surgical anchor projects
 over the right humeral head.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 seen within the thoracic spine.  Multiple clips are noted in the left upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval development of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas tracking
 into the fascia planes of the neck.
 2. Fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease, not substantially changed in
 the interval, with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
 3. Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.
