                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Displaced PICC line.  Evaluate line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 right PICC is seen terminating within the mid-to-low SVC, not significantly
 changed.  A left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial, right
 ventricular, and left ventricular leads is unchanged in appearance.
 
 A moderate left pleural effusion is increased while a small right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  There is left lower lung compressive atelectasis,
 although concomitant infection at the left base cannot be excluded.  There is
 no overt pulmonary edema, although the hila appear engorged.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned right PICC, with tip in the mid-to-low SVC.
 
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion and left lower lung atelectasis. 
 Concomitant infection at the left lung base cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Unchanged moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
