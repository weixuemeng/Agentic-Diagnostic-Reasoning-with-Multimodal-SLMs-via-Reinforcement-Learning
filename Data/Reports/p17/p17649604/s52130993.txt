  1. Right IJ central line terminates in the right atrium. This could be pulled
  back 2-3 cm to be at the superior cavoatrial junction.
  
  2. New opacity in the right lung base, likely reflecting atelectasis but
  cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
  
  3.  Possible small right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension now sp RIJ placement  // adequate
 RIJ CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central line terminates in the right atrium. This could be pulled
 back 2-3 cm to be at the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and demonstrate emphysematous changes. A new
 opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis, but cannot exclude
 pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. There is possible small
 right pleural effusion. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
