                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R IJ line pulled back // assess for line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from 23:00 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval retraction of the right
 internal jugular central venous catheter, which now terminates in the low SVC.
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with slightly improved aeration of the right lung
 base since the prior study. Bilateral emphysematous changes are stable. There
 is no over pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable.
 
 Nodular opacity in the right lung base is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous line is in appropriate position,
 terminating in the low SVC.
 2. Improved aeration of the right lung base since the prior study.
 3. Severe emphysema.
 4. Right basilar opacity likely represents overlapping structures rather than
 a discrete pulmonary nodule, however attention on follow-up imaging is
 recommended.
