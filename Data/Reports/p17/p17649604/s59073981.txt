                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  The exam is otherwise
 unchanged since the recent study performed five days earlier.  If there is
 strong clinical suspicion for acute rib fracture, dedicated rib radiographs
 with metallic marker at site of symptoms may be helpful for more complete
 assessment if warranted clinically.
