                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  The patient is examined in
 upright position using PA and lateral views.  In comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination, the mostly basally located hazy
 densities have decreased.  The left lung base remains obscured by the heart
 shadow.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified.  Comparison is
 extended to the PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The
 previously existing bilateral pleural effusions have clearly improved and only
 a minor degree of elevation and blunting of the posterior pleural sinus
 remains.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  Previously described
 cardiac enlargement, status post sternotomy and multivessel bypass surgery
 with metallic surgical clips in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax is
 identified and the position of the previously described dual-lumen
 hemodialysis catheter advanced via the right internal jugular approach remains
 unchanged, terminating in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of bilateral pleural effusions, some crowded
 pulmonary vasculature on the left base, but no new acute infiltrates
 identified.
