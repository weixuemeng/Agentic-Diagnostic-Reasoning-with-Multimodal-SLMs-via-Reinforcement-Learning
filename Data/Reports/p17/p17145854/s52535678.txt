                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion.  Evaluate for change in
 effusion after hemodialysis.
 
 A semi-upright portable chest radiograph shows obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm by pleural fluid and possibly some associated consolidation. 
 The most recent previous study is dated one day earlier, and fluid today
 appears increased rather than decreased.  The central pulmonary vasculature
 appears somewhat full, but unchanged.  No overt edema is evident.  The heart
 is large, better evaluated on yesterday's image because of fluid silhouetting
 out the lateral border of the heart on today's study.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, and intact sternal wires and multiple
 mediastinal clips are seen.  Right-sided tunneled hemodialysis catheter is
 seen and both the tips appear at the level of the proximal right atrium. 
 Joint space loss is seen at the right glenohumeral joint where subchondral
 sclerosis and bony eburnation is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  In taking into account differences in technique, there is
 probably no decrease in pleural fluid at the left base and possibly increased
 consolidation compared to yesterday's exam.
