                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been no change in perihilar interstitial
 opacities but interval increase in bibasal consolidations and bilateral
 pleural effusion. The findings most likely represent a combination of
 multifocal infection in the presence of interstitial edema. Left basal
 consolidation is particularly progressing as compared to previous examination.
 The patient is after right axillary surgery. Giving the complexity of the
 above described findings correlation with chest CT would be beneficial to
 exclude the possibility of the process different from interstitial pulmonary
 edema and consolidation in the lungs.
