 FINDINGS: 
 
 A do lead pacemaker is unchanged in position compared to the prior study.  The
 heart size appears enlarged even allowing for the projection.  Lung volumes
 are within normal limits.  There is diffuse prominence of the bronchovascular
 markings with apparent diffuse reticular opacities.  The findings are more
 consistent with interstitial lung disease than acute infection although this
 could have a similar appearance.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation seen however there is diffuse prominence of the
 bronchovascular air markings and increased haziness throughout both lungs. 
 The appearance is more suggestive of interstitial lung disease however acute
 infection could have a similar appearance.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
