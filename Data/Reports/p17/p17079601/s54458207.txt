                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a little overall
 change and no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Areas of fibrotic scarring
 are again seen bilaterally.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of
 normal in size.  Mild increase in the AP diameter of the chest and flattening
 of the hemidiaphragms suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
