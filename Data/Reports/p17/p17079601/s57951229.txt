                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate increased AP diameter of
 the chest and flattened hemidiaphragms, suggestive of underlying chronic lung
 disease.  Linear opacities in the lung bases are stable and likely represent
 areas of scarring.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is
 top normal.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
