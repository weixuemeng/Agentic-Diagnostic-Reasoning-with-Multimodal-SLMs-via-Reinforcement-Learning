                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Strep pneumonia, bacteremia, question focal consolidation.
 
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is new hazy density at the right base,
 consistent with a small effusion.  The possibility of an underlying pneumonic
 infiltrate cannot be excluded.  There is probably also a small left-sided
 effusion.  
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary hila are prominent, with a tapered
 appearance.  The AP window is obscured, which can reflect the presence of
 lymphadenopathy.  Upper zone redistribution, but no CHF.
 
 Incidental note is made of clips in the subcutaneous tissues along the upper
 right abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right greater than left small pleural effusions.  Possibility of an
 underlying pneumonic infiltrate at the right base cannot be excluded.  
 
 2. Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 3. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 4. Prominent pulmonary hila raise the question of pulmonary hypertension.  
 
 4.  Obscuration of the aortopulmonary window. Note is made that there was a
 similar fullness to the AP window, albeit slightly less pronounced, on a
 radiograph from ___.  The appearance on that film was more suggestive of
 overlap of vascular structures. In the appropriate clinical setting, the
 differential diagnosis would include AP window lymphadenopathy.
