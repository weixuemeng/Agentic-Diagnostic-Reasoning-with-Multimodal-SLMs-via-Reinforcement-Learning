                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 4.4 cm below the superior
 aspect of the aortic knob.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right
 pulmonary artery, and nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, although
 the side port is in close proximity to the GE junction.  There remains marked
 volume loss in the left hemithorax, with a substantial shift of
 cardiomediastinal structures towards the left.  In the absence of more remote
 radiographs for comparison, it is uncertain whether the left-sided volume loss
 is longstanding (for example related to previous surgery or chronic scarring),
 or a more acute process.  There remains extensive lung opacification
 predominantly in the left lower lobe, as well as a moderate left pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is markedly overexpanded, and demonstrates severe
 emphysema in the upper and mid lung regions.  Developing opacity at the right
 lung base is concerning for an evolving pneumonia in this region.  A probable
 small right pleural effusion has developed, and there is a questionable tiny
 right apical pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Marked volume loss in left hemithorax of uncertain chronicity. In the absence
 of outside radiographs for comparison, consider contrast-enhanced CT to
 exclude a central mass as a potential cause for extensive left lung volume
 loss and associated left lower lung atelectasis/consolidation.
 
 Evolving right lower lobe pneumonia.
