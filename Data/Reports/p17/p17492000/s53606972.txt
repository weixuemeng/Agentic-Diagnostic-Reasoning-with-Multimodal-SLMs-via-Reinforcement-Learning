                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, rule out pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 4:14 a.m.
 
 Compared with film from one day earlier and allowing for technical
 differences, I doubt significant interval change.  There are low inspiratory
 volumes with an elevated left hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is enlarged but unchanged.  There is increased retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and mild diffuse
 vascular blurring.  Possible slight interval improvement in patchy opacity at
 right lung base.
