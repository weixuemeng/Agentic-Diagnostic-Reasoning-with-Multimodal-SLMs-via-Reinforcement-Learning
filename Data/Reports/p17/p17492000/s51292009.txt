                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:15 p.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, there has been slight increased
 opacification at the left base, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
