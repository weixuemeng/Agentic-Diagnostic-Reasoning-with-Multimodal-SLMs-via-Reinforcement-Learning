                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, rule out pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, at 15:22 p.m., there is slight interval improvement
 in the pulmonary opacities.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacity, with
 faint alveolar component in the right mid zone and patchy increased
 retrocardiac density, remains present.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggests a small right effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in bilateral opacities, with residual
 interstitial opacities bilaterally and faint alveolar right mid zone and left
 lower lobe opacity.  Small right effusion. This could represent reolving CHF,
 though a diffuse underlying process cannot be excluded at this time.
