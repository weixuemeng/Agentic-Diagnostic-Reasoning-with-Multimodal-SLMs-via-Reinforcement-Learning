                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD1 with sacrospinous suspension, TVT,
 cystoscopy for vaginal prolapse with h/o lung nodules and new oxygen
 requirmement  // please eval for pneumonia, effusion, pulm edema and interval
 change in lung nodules
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes with right base atelectasis versus developing pneumonia.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions. Cholecystectomy clips. Calcified thoracic
 aorta. Heart size within normal. No pneumothorax. Mild interstitial prominence
 is noted.  An ovoid focus overlying the right chest on frontal view measures
 12mm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral interstitial prominence, nonspecific finding, possibly indicating
 interstitial lung disease rather than interstitial edema.  CT correlation
 would be helpful for characterization.
 
 Ovoid focus in the right chest, possible pulmonary nodule.  Recommed
 comparison with prior studies and acquisition of CT if clinically warranted.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
