                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___ at 10:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A large right pleural effusion is present.  There is associated right basilar
 opacification likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Left lung is
 clear.  No left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  The mediastinal contours appear
 unremarkable where visualized.  Heart size is difficult to assess, but is
 likely within normal limits.  Probable cholecystectomy clips are seen in the
 upper abdomen on the lateral view.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large right pleural effusion with right basilar opacification likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely
 excluded.
