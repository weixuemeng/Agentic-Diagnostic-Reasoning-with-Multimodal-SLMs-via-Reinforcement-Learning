                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with seizures, further evaluate
 alleged small triangular radiodense lesion seen on lateral view only.
 
 FINDINGS:  A repeat PA and lateral chest study has been performed with patient
 in upright position.  The images are better penetrated in particular.  The
 lateral view shows improved demonstration of upper thoracic pulmonary and bony
 structures.  The patient has a mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature in the
 upper portion of the thoracic spine and mild degenerative changes in the form
 of osteophytic reactions at the vertebral body anterior edges.  No vertebral
 body compression fracture can be identified.  There are multiple overlying
 external wires on the lateral view.  Again there is no evidence of any acute
 pulmonary infiltrate, pleural effusion or pneumothorax and thus a pneumonia
 can be ruled out.  The technically improved PA and lateral chest view cannot
 identify any other suspicious pulmonary or skeletal abnormalities as
 detectable on routine PA and lateral chest views.
