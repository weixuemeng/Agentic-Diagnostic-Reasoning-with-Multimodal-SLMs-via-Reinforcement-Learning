                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness and increasing WBC. 
 Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left pectoral neural stimulating device
 sends a lead to the left neck. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  On the frontal view, both lungs are clear, and there is no pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax. On the lateral view a triangular radiodensity
 overlying a upper thoracic vertebral body could be the superimposition of
 overlying bone structures, but because it could also be a lung nodule or small
 region of consolidation, we recommend oblique radiographs for further
 evaluation. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:12 am on ___ via telephone.
