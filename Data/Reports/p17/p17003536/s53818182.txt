                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent craniotomy, presenting with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs were acquired.  As before, there is
 hyperinflation of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms and widening
 of the retrosternal airspace, consistent with COPD.  Aside from minimal
 bibasilar linear atelectasis, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Minimal biapical pleural thickening is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, COPD.
