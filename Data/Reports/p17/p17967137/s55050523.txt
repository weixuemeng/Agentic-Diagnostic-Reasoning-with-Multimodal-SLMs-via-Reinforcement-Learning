                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic sulcus on the frontal view suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  A right internal central
 jugular venous catheter is somewhat difficult to follow in the mediastinum but
 it appears to terminate in the superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
