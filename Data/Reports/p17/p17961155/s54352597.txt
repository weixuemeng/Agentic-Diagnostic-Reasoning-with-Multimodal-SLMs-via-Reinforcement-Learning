                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with polysubstance o/d, cough and wheezing  // ?cpd 
 ?cpd
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 THERE ARE NO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW.
 
 A vague increase in relative ___ base of the left lung could be due
 to overlying breast tissue, since there is no clear correlate on the lateral
 view.  However I would recommend oblique views to get a second look what might
 be a subtle pneumonia.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal
