  1.  Endotracheal tube tip at the level of the clavicles.  Consider advancing
  1.5 cm for better positioning.
  2.  New retrocardiac opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration
  pneumonia and less likely atelectasis.   Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute respiratory distress  // respiratory
 distress, interval change      respiratory distress, interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly placed or newly visible endotracheal tube ends just above the upper
 margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina and should be
 advanced 3 cm for optimal placement.  Left lower lobe consolidation with
 volume loss, indicating a component of collapse, is new.  A very small amount
 of air highlighting the left mediastinal border from the aortic arch to the
 left atrial appendage, is probably pneumomediastinum.  This may be a function
 of positive pressure ventilation.  Clinical monitoring is advised prior to any
 additional imaging, especially because the subsequent chest radiograph
 available the time of this review, 05:46 on ___, shows no progression of
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 Feeding tube ends in the region of the pylorus.  Right upper lung is clear. 
 Right lower lung may be shadowing early consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
