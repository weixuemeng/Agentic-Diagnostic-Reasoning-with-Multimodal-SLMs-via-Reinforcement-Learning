                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, pna, incr secretions  // interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 549
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 An enteric type tube is present, with radiopaque tip overlying the distal
 stomach.  A left subclavian central line is present, tip overlying distal SVC.
 There is probably an ET tube present.  The ET tube tip is poorly visualized
 due to overlying structures, but it appears to lie at the level of the lower
 clavicular heads, approximately 6.6 cm above the carina, similar to the prior
 film.
 
 Compared with the prior film, there is new hazy opacity at the right base,
 which appears to represent a small to moderate size pleural effusion. 
 Underlying collapse and/or consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is also
 increased retrocardiac opacification, with new obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is upper zone redistribution,  without overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Hazy opacity right base, likely a new effusion, probably with some degree
 of underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 3. Findings at the bases include the possibility of pneumonic infiltrates.
