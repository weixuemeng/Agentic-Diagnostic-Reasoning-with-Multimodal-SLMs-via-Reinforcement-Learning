 There are low lung volumes in this patient with normal-sized heart who has
 previously undergone CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires.
 Dual-channel pacer device is in place with leads in the right atrium and apex
 of the right ventricle.  There is indistinctness of pulmonary markings
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Mild basilar atelectasis
 is seen bilaterally.  There is an area of more focal opacification in the
 right mid zone. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect a
 developing consolidation.
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
