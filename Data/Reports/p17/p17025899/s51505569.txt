                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with removal of mediastinal chest tubes
 and central line change over wire, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The patient is now extubated.  The previously
 existing Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  The sheath has been exchanged
 over a wire by a right internal jugular route line, the tip of which reaches
 some 4 cm below the level of the carina in the area of the expected right
 SVC/atrial junction.  Whereas the right-sided chest tube has been removed, the
 left-sided tube remains in unchanged appropriate position.  Heart size has
 increased slightly postoperatively, but no significant increase of pulmonary
 congestive pattern or new infiltrates is seen.  The previously mentioned
 metallic structures of a mitral valve prosthesis remain in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Central venous line terminating close to atrial
 junction.  Recommend withdrawal by 2 cm to avoid possible contact with cardiac
 structures.
