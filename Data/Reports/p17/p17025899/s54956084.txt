                                 FINAL REPORT
 Hypoxia, chest pain and crackles, assess for infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable upright radiograph was obtained of the chest.  Lungs are low in
 volume with extensive bilateral perihilar and lower lung opacities with likely
 trace bilateral pleural effusions compatible with pulmonary edema.  However
 the heart is normal size and less than three weeks ago there were findings in
 the right lower lobe more likely pneumonia. Fullness in the right paratracheal
 stripe could be due to venous engorgement or adenopathy, now involving the
 aortopulmonic window.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, alternatively severe
 pneumonia.
