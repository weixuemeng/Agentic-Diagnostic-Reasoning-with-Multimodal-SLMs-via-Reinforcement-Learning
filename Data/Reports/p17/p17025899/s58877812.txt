 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Dual-channel pacer is in place with leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Opacification is seen at the left base.  On the frontal view it
 suggests a meniscus reflecting pleural effusion, though on the lateral view
 the appearance could well represent pleural thickening.  Lateral decubitus
 view could make this distinction.
