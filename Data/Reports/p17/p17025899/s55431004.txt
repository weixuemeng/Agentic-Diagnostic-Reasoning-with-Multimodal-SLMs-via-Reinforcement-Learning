                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with crackles on right lower lobe, cough
 for four days.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size remains within normal limits. 
 There is mild widening and slight elongation of the thoracic aorta, but no
 local contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  There exists now hazy infiltrates on the right lung base,
 confirmed on the lateral view and locating to the posterior segment of the
 right lower lobe.  The pleural spaces remain free.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 In comparison with the previous study, the now described pneumonic infiltrate
 is new.  It is recommended to perform a followup examination after successful
 treatment.
