                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray in ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior study from ___, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable, reflective of probably mild cardiomegaly.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are again seen.  There are low lung volumes with crowding of
 the normal bronchovascular structures.  Centrally predominant prominence of
 the pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There
 is no pneumothorax, however note that the lung apices are obscured on this
 study.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  No sizable right pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. 
 No focal lung consolidation.
 2. Probable trace left pleural effusion.  No definite right pleural effusion.
