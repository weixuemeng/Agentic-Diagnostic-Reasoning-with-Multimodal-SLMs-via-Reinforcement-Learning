   PICC has been pulled back.  Now the tip is in the upper SVC.  Improved
  basilar opacities, likely from resolving atelectasis.  Nearly completely
  resolved pleural effusions, possible tiny effusion persists on the left.  No
  pulmonary edema.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.

 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the PICC line has been pulled
 back to the upper SVC.  The bibasilar opacifications and pulmonary congestion
 has substantially improved.  Any residual pleural effusions would be quite
 small and there are minimal atelectatic changes at the bases.
