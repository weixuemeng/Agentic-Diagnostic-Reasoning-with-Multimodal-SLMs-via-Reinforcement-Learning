                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Left base
 retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings
 without definite focal consolidation.  Dedicated PA view with deeper
 inspiration may be helpful for further evaluation.
