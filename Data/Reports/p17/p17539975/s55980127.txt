                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  However, there is also mild interstial opacities
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 confluent consolidation or pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema though no consolidation.
