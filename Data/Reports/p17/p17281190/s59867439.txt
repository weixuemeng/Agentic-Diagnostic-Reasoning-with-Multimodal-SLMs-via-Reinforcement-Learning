                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Advanced CKD, now with pain and swelling of extremities after
 missing 4 days of Lasix with some subjective shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded.  There are prominent interstitial
 markings, increased from prior exam, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. 
 There is a right apical 1.5 cm density, potentially within the first rib, but
 could represent a lung nodule.  There is free intraperitoneal air, consistent
 with peritoneal dialysis.  Cardiomegaly is seen.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Right apical 1.5 cm density, potentially within the first rib, however
 apical lordotic view recommended to exclude lung nodule. 
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema. 
 
 3.  Small amount of free intraperitoneal air, consistent with peritoneal
 dialysis.
