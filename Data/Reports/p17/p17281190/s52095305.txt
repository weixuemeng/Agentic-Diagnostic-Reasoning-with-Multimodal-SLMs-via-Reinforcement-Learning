 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Scarring is re- demonstrated in the
 right apex.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 moderate multilevel degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
