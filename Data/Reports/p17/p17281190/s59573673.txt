                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p renal transplant with multifocal pneumonia,
 worsening SOB  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:57
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Again seen is marked cardiomegaly.  Allowing for
 technical differences, this is probably similar to the prior study. 
 Crescentic opacity adjacent to the right heart border may correspond to the
 thickened inferior portion of the right hilum seen on the prior study. 
 Allowing for technical differences between the 2 films,  again seen is some
 patchy opacity in the right upper zone and possibly some increased
 retrocardiac opacity.  No definite interval change is seen in these areas. 
 Equivocal new focal opacity in the left upper zone.  No overt consolidation is
 identified.
 
 A small left effusion is present is likely present.  Possible minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle, but no gross right effusion is seen.
 
 Again seen is an enteric tube extending beneath the diaphragm off the film and
 a right subclavian PICC line tip near cavoatrial junction.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked cardiomegaly is similar to the prior film, allowing for differences
 in positioning.
 2. Multifocal opacities most pronounced in the right upper and left lower
 zones again noted, non-specific, but compatible with pneumonic infiltrates. 
 Equivocal new area of patchy opacity at the left upper zone.
 3. Although there may be small bilateral effusions, the difference, if any, is
 minimal.
 4. No definite superimposed CHF.
