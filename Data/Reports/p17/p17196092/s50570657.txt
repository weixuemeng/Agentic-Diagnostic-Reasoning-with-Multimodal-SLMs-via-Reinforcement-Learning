                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right-sided chest wall tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are slightly low lung volumes and minimal right base
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 There may be slight irregularity of the right scapula; however, is not fully
 included on this study nor well evaluated; if this is site of concern, suggest
 dedicated imaging of the scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If clinical concern for
 fracture, suggest dedicated imaging of the region.
