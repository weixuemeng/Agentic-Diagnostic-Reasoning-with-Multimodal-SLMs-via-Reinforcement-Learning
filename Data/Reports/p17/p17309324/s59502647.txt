                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with confusion, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm, though much less prominent than on the previous study.
 Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size, but there is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen
 at the bases.
 
 The dense calcification in the mitral annulus seen previously is again noted.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia.
