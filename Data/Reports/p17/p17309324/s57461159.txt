                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Low
 lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular structures, particularly at
 the lung bases.  No focal areas of consolidation are identified.  There is a
 suggestion of a small right pleural effusion.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No definite pneumonia, but repeat radiograph
 with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete evaluation of
 the lung bases when the patient's condition permits.
