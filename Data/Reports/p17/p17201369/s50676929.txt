                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:26 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is no longer elevated, presumably reflecting either
 improvement in intestinal distention or remission of previously unrecognized
 left lower lobe atelectasis.  Lungs are clear aside from a small cylindrical
 opacity in the right mid lung laterally which could be either atelectasis or
 tiny mucoid impaction.  Pleural effusion is insignificant, if any.  The heart
 is normal size.  This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis
 of acute pulmonary embolism.
