                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:56.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided pacemaker
 device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle remain
 in unchanged positions.  The heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged.
 The aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present with patchy retrocardiac opacity
 potentially reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis though infection is difficult
 to exclude in the correct clinical setting.
