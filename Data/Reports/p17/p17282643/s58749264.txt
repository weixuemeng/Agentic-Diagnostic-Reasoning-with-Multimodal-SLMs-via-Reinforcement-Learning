                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with chest pain, pneumomediastinum, possible pneumothorax
 on OSH xray.  Please do an expiratory film to best assess for pneumothorax  //
 Evaluate status of free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Inspiratory and expiratory and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is evidence of pneumomediastinum extending into the base of the neck in
 the supraclavicular region on the left.  There is no visualized pneumothorax. 
 There is an 8 mm nodule projecting over the right upper lung and anterior
 right first rib.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormalities, no
 displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumomediastinum.  No visualized pneumothorax.
 An 8 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right lung apex.  It is possible
 that this is related to the anterior right first rib, apical lordotic can
 confirm after patient's acute symptoms resolve.
