                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate retrocardiac opacity seen in prior study.  Patient
 with HIV, on HAART.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger
 on the left side and are associated with adjacent opacities, most likely
 atelectases, though superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.  There
 is mild vascular congestion with no pneumothorax.
