                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new diagnosis of subacute bacterial
 endocarditis on aortic and mitral valves.  Please evaluate for evidence of
 septic pulmonary emboli that may suggest right-sided involvement. Please
 evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is substantially enlarged.Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is diffusely increased interstitial opacity, likely due to
 pulmonary edema.  There are no parenchymal opacities suggestive of
 radiographic evidence of septic pulmonary emboli.
 There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mildly enlarged heart.  Pulmonary edema.
 2. No evidence of septic pulmonary emboli at the resolution of plain film.  If
 there is strong suspicion for septic emboli, CT chest would be the next
 imaging modality.
