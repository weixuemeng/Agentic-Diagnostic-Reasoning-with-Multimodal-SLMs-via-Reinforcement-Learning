                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p AVR/MVR  // reeval right hemidiaphragm
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a subdiaphragmatic lucency has
 decreased in extent and likely reflects resolving pneumoperitoneum.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for slight increase in size of small to moderate left
 pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar atelectasis.  Small right pleural
 effusion persists.
