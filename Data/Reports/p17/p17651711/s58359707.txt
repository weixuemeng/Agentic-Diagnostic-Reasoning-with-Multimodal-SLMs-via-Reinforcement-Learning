                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, hypotension  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There may be mild, central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  Again noted are
 aortic arch calcifications.  There appears to be an opacity in the
 retrocardiac region.  Evaluation of the lateral film is limited due to patient
 positioning and poor inspiratory effort.  Possible small right pleural
 effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity which could be consistent with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical context.
