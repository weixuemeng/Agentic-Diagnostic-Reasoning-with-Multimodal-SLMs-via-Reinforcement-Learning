 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in the postoperative period.  Atelectatic changes in the
 right middle and both lower lobes are again demonstrated, slightly worse in
 the left lower lobe in the interval.  Moderate right and small left pleural
 effusions are unchanged when allowances are made for positional differences
 between the exams.
