                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough/blood  // hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since chest radiographs dated ___, there is been interval resolution of
 the left apical pneumothorax and moderate right pleural effusion.  There is
 hazy opacification of the ipsilateral left lower lung without air bronchograms
 or ipsilateral pleural effusion.  Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear
 without consolidations.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Pleural surfaces are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, hazy opacification of the lateral left lower lung is concerning for an
 infectious process which may be contributing to the patient's hemoptysis. 
 Recommend follow-up PA and lateral chest radiographs in 4 weeks to assess for
 resolution.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up PA and lateral chest radiographs in 4
 weeks.  If hemoptysis persists, consider CT chest.
