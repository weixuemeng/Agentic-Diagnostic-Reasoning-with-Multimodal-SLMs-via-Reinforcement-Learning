                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Heart remains mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right are relatively unchanged.  Linear
 opacities within the left lung base likely reflect chronic scarring.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present. 
 Previously seen calcified pleural plaques on the chest CT are not clearly
 visualized on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little interval change from prior with continued small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, and left basilar scarring.
