                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracotomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has been
 removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The right subcutaneous
 emphysema has substantially cleared.  There is some increasing opacification
 at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, suggesting
 atelectasis and small effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
