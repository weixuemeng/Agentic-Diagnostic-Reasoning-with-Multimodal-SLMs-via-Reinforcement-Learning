                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Stent with the needed to more
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The aorta
 is tortuous and calcified.  Bilateral interstitial opacities are suggestive of
 an atypical infection or potentially related to fluid overload.  A calcified 6
 mm nodule projected over the right mid lung is consistent with a granuloma. 
 Multiple compression deformities are seen throughout the thoracic spine of
 unknown chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Predominantly interstitial lung pattern which raises concern for atypical
 pneumonia versus fluid overload.  Multiple compression deformities of the
 thoracic spine of unknown chronicity.
