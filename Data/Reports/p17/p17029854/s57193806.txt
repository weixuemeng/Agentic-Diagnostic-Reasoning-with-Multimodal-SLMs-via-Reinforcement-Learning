                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post redo sternotomy and mitral valve repair
 posterior.  Evaluate for effusions and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 When compared to prior radiograph dated ___, there is improved
 aeration of bilateral lungs.  No new focal consolidation.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or definite pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly
 and hilar contours.  Two sclerotic lesions are identified within the proximal
 humerus, only partially seen on prior recent chest radiographs and which most
 likely represent bony islands.  Recommend dedicated shoulder view radiographs
 in 3 months for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improved aeration of bilateral lung fields with stable cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Two sclerotic lesions identified in the proximal humerus, only partially
 viewed on recent prior chest radiographs.  Recommend dedicated shoulder view
 radiographs in 3 months to confirm suspicion of bony islands.
