                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve
 replacement.  Stable postoperative appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. 
 Worsening atelectasis in the left lower lobe with persistent small left
 pleural effusion.  Patchy and linear atelectasis in the right mid and lower
 lung is again demonstrated.  Small right apical lateral pneumothorax is
 probably unchanged while allowances are made for positional differences
 between the exams.
