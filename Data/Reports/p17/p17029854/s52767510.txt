                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, hx chf/afib  // overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Probable background hyperinflation, which could reflect COPD.  Again seen is
 marked, polychamber cardiomegaly, similar to ___.  The appearance
 raises the possibility of pericardial fluid, but no obvious interval change is
 identified.  Sternotomy wires and prosthetic mitral valve are again noted.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and minimal vascular plethora, without
 other evidence of CHF.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is again noted to be elevated.  There is patchy
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  This is similar in appearance to
 prior studies seen could reflect atelectasis and/or scarring.  Otherwise, no
 focal infiltrate is identified. Minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic
 angles is consistent with tiny bilateral pleural effusions versus minimal
 pleural thickening and is less pronounced than on ___.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked cardiomegaly, without significant change.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, with mild vascular plethora and minimal
 posterior pleural fluid and/or thickening.
 3. Probable atelectasis and/or scarring in the right cardiophrenic region,
 similar to the prior study.
 4. Allowing for this, no new focal pneumonic infiltrate identified.
