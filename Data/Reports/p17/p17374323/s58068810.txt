                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for widened mediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  The lung volumes are
 low.  There is likely bronchovascular crowding accounting for the lower lobe
 opacities, though the possibility of mild pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No
 convincing signs of pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears essentially stable from
 prior.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to low lung volumes.  Lower lung opacities
 likely reflect bronchovascular crowding, though interstitial edema is not
 excluded.
