                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with possible consolidation on chest radiograph
 at an outside hospital, now status post resuscitation, presenting with
 worsening hypoxia.  Patient has a history of metastatic signet ring cell
 rectal cancer and on palliative chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Vague linear opacities in the left lung likely represent atelectasis and is
 largely unchanged from prior studies.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  A right chest wall infusion port and catheter are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague linear opacities in the left lung likely represent atelectasis.  However
 very early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting cannot be entirely
 excluded.
