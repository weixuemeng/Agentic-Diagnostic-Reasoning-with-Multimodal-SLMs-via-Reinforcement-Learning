                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged, and likely accentuated
 due to the presence of low lung volumes. The aorta remains tortuous. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present, more pronounced on the right.
 Bibasilar opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is
 present though assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck
 soft tissues projecting over these regions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar
 opacities, likely atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
