                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are relatively low lung volumes which
 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Indistinctness of mildly
 engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite acute pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
