                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall, question acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Given lower lung volumes there has been no change. 
 The lung volumes likely account for crowding of the pulmonary vascular
 markings.  Linear opacities at the left lung base likely due to atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Calcific density
 projecting over the right scapula, potentially intra-articular bodies. 
 Osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
