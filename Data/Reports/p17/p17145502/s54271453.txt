                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous x-ray
 from ___.  Correlation is also made to CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There is somewhat linear opacity
 identified at the right lung base suggestive of atelectasis.  Increased
 density projects over the posterior costophrenic angles compatible with
 Bochdalek hernia on the left identified on prior CT.  Elsewhere, lungs are
 clear.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Probable right
 basilar atelectasis.  If desired, repeat exam with better inspiratory effort
 can be performed.
