                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained, though the
 left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic sulcus are excluded from view.  The heart
 remains markedly enlarged with interval increase in mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and perhaps trace new pulmonary edema.  Small right and likely
 small left pleural effusions are seen without focal consolidation on the
 imaged portions of the chest.  There is no pneumothorax.  Dual lead pacemaker
 device is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Trace pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions with incomplete
 evaluation of the left base without findings of pneumonia on the imaged chest.
