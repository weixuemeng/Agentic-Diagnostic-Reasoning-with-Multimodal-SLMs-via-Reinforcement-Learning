                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again, there are small bilateral pleural effusions with basilar
 atelectasis in a patient with huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 without pulmonary vascular congestion.  This discordancy suggests underlying
 cardiomyopathy or possible pericardial effusion.  Pacer device remains in good
 position.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
