 INDICATION:  ___M with fatigue x 3d  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low. There is
 mild left basal opacity which is more compatible with atelectasis though
 difficult to exclude a subtle pneumonia.  Otherwise lungs are clear.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild left basal opacity which could represent atelectasis, though difficult to
 exclude pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
