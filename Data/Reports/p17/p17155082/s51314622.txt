                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia overnight with bibasilar crackles, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP portable chest radiograph.  Lungs are low in volume with mild
 right basilar atelectasis and trace effusion.  Increased retrocardiac
 consolidation suggests larger amount of atelectasis and small to moderate
 pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lungs are clear without pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac size is stably enlarged with tortuous aortic contour. Left PICC
 courses into the SVC with an unusual turn, raising concern for termination
 within the azygous. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Left greater than right basilar atelectasis and pleural effusions,
 slightly increased on the left. Left PICC may terminate within the azygous;
 consider a lateral radiograph for further assessment. 
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at ___ on ___, 2
 minutes after discovery.
