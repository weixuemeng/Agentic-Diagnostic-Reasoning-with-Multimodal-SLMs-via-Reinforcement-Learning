                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 1:45 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old from outside hospital with PICC line, check
 position.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 1:45 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been a prior median sternotomy.  Heart is mildly enlarged
 despite portable technique.  There is some prominence of both hilar regions,
 which could reflect prominent pulmonary arteries, raising the possibility of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension or lymphadenopathy.  Comparison to prior
 studies would be helpful to assess for interval change and clinical
 correlation would also be advised.  The left subclavian PICC line courses
 across midline and appears to have its tip abutting the lateral border of the
 proximal superior vena cava.  A pullback of 2-3 cm would place the tip in a
 more central portion of the vessel. Streaky opacities at both lung bases
 likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  There is likely a layering left
 effusion with more focal patchy opacity at the left base which could reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although superimposed infectious process should also
 be considered.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
