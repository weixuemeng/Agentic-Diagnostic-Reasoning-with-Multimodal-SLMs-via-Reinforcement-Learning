                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for
 marked leftward patient rotation.  Lung bases are difficult to accurately
 assess due to patient rotation, but there has been apparent slight worsening
 of nonspecific patchy areas of opacity at both lung bases.  Attention to these
 regions on a repeat non-rotated radiograph would be helpful in this regard. 
 Remainder of lungs are clear.
