                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy with possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The costophrenic angles are quite sharply seen at this
 time.  There may be minimal atelectatic changes at the right base, but no
 definite evidence for discrete consolidation.
 
 The right subclavian catheter again extends to the upper to mid portion of the
 SVC.
