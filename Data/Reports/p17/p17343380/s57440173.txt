                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with frequent falls and
 chest pain, assessment for rib fractures.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___ obtained earlier.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Slight interval increase in bibasal
 opacities is noted.  No pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  Within the limitations of this study technique, no clear
 evidence of rib fractures is demonstrated but dedicated rib views would be
 beneficial to exclude non-displaced fracture.
