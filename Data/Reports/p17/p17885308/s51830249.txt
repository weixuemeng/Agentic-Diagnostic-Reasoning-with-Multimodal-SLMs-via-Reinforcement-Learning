                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are two relevant
 findings.
 
 The size of the heart is increasing with subsequent development of a small
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  However, there are currently no signs of overt
 pulmonary edema, and no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 In the left lung, there is a 1.5 cm nodular opacity, projecting behind the
 sixth and seventh posterior rib.  Although the opacity could correspond to a
 slightly calcified costochondral junction, the presence of a pulmonary nodule
 should be excluded using CT.
 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusions.  No other pulmonary nodules or
 parenchymal changes.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The finding was communicated through the radiology dashboard at the time of
 dictation, 5:09 p.m., on ___.  The original observation of the
 abnormality was made seven minutes prior to this time point.
