                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NG tube placement for small-bowel obstruction, here to evaluate
 NG tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 04:14 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an enteric feeding tube which
 courses to the level of the diaphragm and appears coiled at this level with
 the tip pointing cranially in the lower esophagus.  Recommend repositioning. 
 The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged from the study performed
 earlier the same day without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately
 enlarged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with mediastinal
 surgical clips compatible with prior CABG surgery.  Calcification at the
 aortic knob is redemonstrated.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube coiled above the gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend
 repositioning.
