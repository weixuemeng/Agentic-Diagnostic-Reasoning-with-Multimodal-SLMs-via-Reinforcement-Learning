                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right PICC line  // eval for PICC line
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the right PICC line is
 unchanged. The line projects over the mid to lower SVC.
 The cavitary lesion in the left upper lung has minimally decreased in extent.
 However, there is a newly appeared mild to moderate right pleural effusion
 with subsequent right basilar atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 sinus suggests the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion. Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
