                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p intubation  // tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   2 discrete round metallic densities
 project over the heart, likely external.  The endotracheal tube is seen with
 its tip positioned 4.7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube passes into the left
 upper abdomen.  There is a linear density in the left lower lung which may
 represent atelectasis.  Adjacent vague opacity is also noted, possibly
 representing aspiration or pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  No supine
 evidence for effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly unremarkable.  No acute bony injuries.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube position with tip 4.7 cm above the carina.  NG tube positioned
 appropriately.
 2. Left basal atelectasis with adjacent opacity, likely aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 3. 2 discrete rounded metallic densities projecting over the heart, likely
 external though clinical correlation is advised.
