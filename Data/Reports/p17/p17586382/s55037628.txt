                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Severe cough, chest pain, lupus and nephritis.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  A rounded opacity in the lower right
 hemithorax could be superimposition of normal structures or a lung nodule. 
 Shallow obliques are recommended for further evaluation.  Otherwise the lungs
 are clear with no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
