                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with primary bone lymphoma s/p chemotherapy in
 ___ presents with cardiac arrest  // Assess position of esophageal balloon
 and OG tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph from earlier today, a Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 repositioned, now terminating in the proximal descending left pulmonary
 artery.  Orogastric tube extends into the distal stomach, with tip beyond the
 field of view.  Other support and monitoring devices are similar in position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Widespread bilateral airspace
 opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left have
 slightly improved.  The right pleural effusion is a persistent finding.
