                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lung suggest
 minor atelectasis.  There is, more generally, mild coarsening of interstitial
 markings and peribronchial cuffing in the mid-to-lower lungs which may suggest
 airway inflammation or potentially slight fluid overload.  A non-displaced
 fracture involving the right posterolateral eighth rib appears at least
 subacute and perhaps more remote.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumonia.  Mildly prominent interstitium
 with peribronchial cuffing, which is not specific and could be seen with fluid
 overload or airway inflammation among other causes, but which is not striking.
