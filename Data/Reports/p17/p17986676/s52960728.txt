 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with a left

 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs are well-aerated and
 clear.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  A small left
 apical pneumothorax appears increased.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable, other than incompletely imaged spinal hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased small left apical pneumothorax.
 2. Although the NG tube terminates within the stomach, the side port is
 proximally GE junction.
