                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with polytrauma s/p fall, now s/p spine surgery,
 intubated/sedated  // ?interval change in pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  APsingle view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 6.2 cm above the carina.  Metallic spinal hardware projects
 over the lumbar spine.  EKG leads overlie the chest wall.  There is asymmetric
 appearance of both lungs, likely due to patient rotation.  Minimal right
 basilar atelectasis, otherwise lungs are clear.  A left apical pneumothorax is
 not clearly visualized.  No pleural effusion noted.  Heart size is within
 normal limits allowing for technique. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  Previously visualized left apical
 pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on this radiograph.  This may partly be
 related to obscuration by overlapping ribs and tubing overlying the patient,
 however there is no interval increase in size, within limitations of this
 supine radiograph.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   NOTIFICATION:
