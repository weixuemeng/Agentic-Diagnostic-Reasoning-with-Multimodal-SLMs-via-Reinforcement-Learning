                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hiatal hernia with
 continued reflux symptoms.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  The bulging contours
 adjacent to the right edge of the thoracic vertebral bodies appears to be
 decreased since the prior study and unchanged dating back to ___. 
 Given the presence of mild scoliosis it most likely reflects the paraspinal
 tissues.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no radiographic evidence of hiatal hernia.  If clinically warranted,
 correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
