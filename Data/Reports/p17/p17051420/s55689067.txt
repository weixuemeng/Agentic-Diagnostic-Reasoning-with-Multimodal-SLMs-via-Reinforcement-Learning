                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 exam was obtained in the relative AP lordotic view position.  Subtle right mid
 lung opacity may be artifactual; however, underlying consolidation or
 ground-glass opacity is not excluded.  Suggest repeat PA and lateral views 
 for better evaluation.  There is minor basilar atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette appears relatively globular in
 configuration.  Underlying pericardial effusion is not excluded.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace
 right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Relative subtle opacity projecting over the right mid lung may be
 artifactual, although underlying ground-glass opacity/consolidation is not
 excluded.  Suggest repeat or dedicated PA and lateral views for further
 evaluation.
 
 2.  The cardiac silhouette appears relatively globular which may relate to
 technique.  However, underlying pericardial effusion is not excluded.
