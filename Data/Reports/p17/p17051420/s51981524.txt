                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CTA ___, chest
 CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. No pulmonary vascular congestion
 is visualized. Subtle increased interstitial opacities are demonstrated
 diffusely within the lungs, likely reflective of known chronic interstitial
 lung disease and chronic airways disease, better assessed on the previous
 chest CT. Atelectasis is also noted in both lung bases. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild chronic interstitial abnormality better assessed on the previous chest CT
 from ___. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
