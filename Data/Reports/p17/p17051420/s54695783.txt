                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multifocal pneumonia,here with chest pain and worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph dated ___ at ___ p.m.
 
 Compared to a prior film and allowing for technical differences, there is some
 new patchy opacity at the right base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution
 with mild vascular plethora.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora.
 
 2.  Developing patchy opacity at the right base.  This could represent
 prominent atelectasis, but the possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate or focus
 of aspiration is also in the differential.  No gross effusion.
