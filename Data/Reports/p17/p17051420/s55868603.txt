 normal limits.  No evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  Wispy equivocal opacity
 projecting over the medial right lung base may represent an early pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting. Otherwise the lungs are clear.  Osseous
 structures demonstrate degenerative changes without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal subtle opacity projecting at the medial right lung base, possibly
 representing an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. Otherwise
 unremarkable.
