                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely borderline enlarged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  There is no focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  No definite radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
