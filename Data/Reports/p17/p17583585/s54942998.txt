                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, now with hypoxia  // interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, heart is upper limits of
 normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and new
 interstitial edema.  More confluent opacities in both lower lungs as well as a
 slightly nodular opacity in the periphery of the right base may reflect
 atelectasis, aspiration, and/or developing infection.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
