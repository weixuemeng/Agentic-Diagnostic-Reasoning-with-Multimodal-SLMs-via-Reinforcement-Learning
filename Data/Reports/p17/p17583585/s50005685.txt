                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, fluid overload  // evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT abdomen pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Airspace consolidation is patchy throughout the left lung concerning for
 pneumonia.  Opacification of the left mid to lower lung is likely secondary to
 a moderate pleural effusion and associated atelectasis in the right lower
 lung.  The right apex remains well aerated.  Heart size cannot be assessed. 
 Bony structures are intact though there is severe degenerative disease at both
 shoulders partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Airspace consolidation in the left lung concerning for pneumonia. Moderate
 right pleural effusion with compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
