                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and history of congestive heart failure and coronary
 disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is also a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable including cardiac enlargement.  There has been
 partial resolution of atelectasis at the left lung base with better expansion
 of the lung, but with a persistent pleural effusion.  In addition, there is a
 nodular focus measuring about 12 mm in diameter, which projects over the left
 lower lung, although most likely due to a nipple shadow.  A new fine
 reticulonodular opacification pattern suggests mild pulmonary edema.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild new reticular nodular pattern suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Improved expansion of the lung at the left base, although with persistent
 small effusion, probably loculated and chronic.
 
 3.  Nodular focus projecting over the left lower lung, newly apparent. 
 Although it is likely to turn out to be a nipple shadow, when clinically
 appropriate, standard PA view with nipple markers is recommended for
 confirmation.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone on ___.
