                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 clear except for minimal linear scar or atelectasis at the left base. There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Ribs are not optimally assessed on a standard
 chest radiograph.  With this limitation in mind, no acute, displaced rib
 fractures are evident. 2.  Subtle lucent bone lesions are better demonstrated
 on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute, displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.  If symptoms are
 localized to a specific region, consider dedicated rib radiographs with
 metallic marker at the site of tenderness.
