                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs with no prior for comparison
 demonstrate bilateral central airspace opacities inferior to the pulmonary
 hila.  There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal appearing, mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Airspace opacities seen inferior to the hila bilaterally, left
 greater than right.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent
 multifocal pneumonia.
