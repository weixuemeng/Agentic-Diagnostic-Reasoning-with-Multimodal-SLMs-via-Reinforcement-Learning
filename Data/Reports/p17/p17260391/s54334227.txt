                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with sore throat and subjective fevers.  Evaluation
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging of the chest is available for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are
 hyperexpanded, but clear, with no evidence of focal air space opacity, pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Mild peribronchial cuffing is
 noted bilaterally.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The
 heart is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation, with mild peribronchial cuffing, possibly due to
 underlying asthma.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
