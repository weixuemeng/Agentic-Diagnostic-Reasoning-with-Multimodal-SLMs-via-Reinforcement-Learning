                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infection or congestion in a patient with fatigue,
 thrombocytopenia, and tenderness to palpation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mildly increased opacity in
 the right infrahilar region, with a possible corresponding opacity on lateral
 view.  This may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia in the right clinical
 setting cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased opacity in the right infrahilar region with a corresponding
 opacity on lateral view may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the right clinical setting.
