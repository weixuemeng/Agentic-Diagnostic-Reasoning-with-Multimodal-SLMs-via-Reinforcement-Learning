                                 FINAL REPORT
 SUPINE PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, seizure, intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Underlying trauma board and other external artifact partially
 obscure the view.  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.9 cm above the carina. 
 An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not
 included on the image.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes and AP supine technique, although this will be
 further evaluated on pending CT torso.  Possible patchy left base opacity
 versus related to overlying external artifact.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No displaced fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, inferir aspect not included
 on the image.
 3.  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, which will be further evaluated on pending CT.
 4.  Possible left base retrocardiac opacity versus external artifact.
