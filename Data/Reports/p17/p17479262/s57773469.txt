                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with incidentally noted possible lung cancer with
 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is a 2.1 x 1.9 cm round mass in the
 left upper lobe.  There is right basilar atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  There is minimal wedging of some midthoracic vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2.1 x 1.9 cm mass in the left upper lobe, highly concerning for malignancy. 
 Recommend correlation with outside imaging, if available.  Alternatively, a CT
 chest with contrast could be performed for further evaluation.
 
 Right basilar atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:   Recommend correlation with outside imaging, if available, to
 assess stability.  Alternatively, a CT chest with contrast could be performed
 for further evaluation.
