                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with palpitations  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Aortic knob calcifications are
 demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 Diffuse coarse interstitial opacities are seen within both lungs, compatible
 with a chronic interstitial lung disease. Patchy opacities within the lung
 bases are more pronounced compared to the prior exam, and could reflect
 progression of interstitial lung disease, but atelectasis or superimposed
 infection is not excluded. Previously noted consolidative opacity in the right
 upper lobe has essentially resolved. No pulmonary edema is present.  No
 pleural effusion, new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect progression of
 underlying chronic interstitial lung disease, but superimposed atelectasis or
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
