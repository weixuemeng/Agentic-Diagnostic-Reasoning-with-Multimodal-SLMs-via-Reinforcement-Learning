                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening hypoxia.  Evaluate for worsening opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bilateral
 parenchymal opacities have slightly improved, particularly at the right lung
 base. There is an element of right lung volume loss. Left basilar opacity is
 likely atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 particularly in the right lower lobe.
