                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large area of right upper lobe opacity highly worrisome for right
 upper lobe pneumonia.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen
 which could be due to a trace pleural effusion, although not substantiated on
 the lateral view.  Areas of scarring are seen scattered in the left lung with
 possible underlying pulmonary emphysema.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
