                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluation for infection or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes and
 bibasilar opacities most consistent with atelectasis given the lack of
 corresponding findings on lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No fracture is
 identified.
