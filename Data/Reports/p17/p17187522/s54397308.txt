                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  COPD, cough and sputum, suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since ___,
 most recently ___:
 
 Distortion of the right anterior diaphragmatic interface is responsible for
 hazy opacification at the base of the right hemithorax.  Lungs are clear. 
 Left lung is hyperinflated, and there may be a diaphragmatic pleural
 calcification.  Explanation for air and fluid collections in the right upper
 quadrant is presumably migration of the intestinal tract following hepatic
 resection in that area, but this is not a complete evaluation of that region
 which should be considered from a clinical standpoint to see if additional
 imaging is necessary.  Post-traumatic rib coalition and pleural thickening is
 noted along the left anterolateral chest wall.  Heart size is normal.  There
 is no left pleural effusion.
