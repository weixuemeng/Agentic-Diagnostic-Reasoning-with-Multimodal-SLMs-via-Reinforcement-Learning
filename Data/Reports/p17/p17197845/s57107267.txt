                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes and elevation the right hemidiaphragm.No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Prominence of the right hilum
 may relate to lower lung volume on the right with possible mild prominence of
 the right pulmonary artery ; this is less evident on the scout image for the
 cervical spine CT performed 10 minutes earlier, which includes the full chest,
 and most likely relates to patient position and low lung volumes on the
 current study.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation.
