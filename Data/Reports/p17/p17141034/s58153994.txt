                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe non-small cell lung cancer, undergoing
 chemotherapy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a superior right lower
 lobe mass, which was recently characterized on CT chest from ___.
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and linear opacities likely represent
 volume loss and atelectasis. Pulmonary nodules are unchanged.  The heart is
 normal in size.  There is a moderate right pleural effusion, and no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate right pleural effusion. 
 
 2. The superior right lower lobe mass is better evaluated on recent CT chest. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and opacity obscuring the right heart
 border likely represent volume loss and atelectasis.
