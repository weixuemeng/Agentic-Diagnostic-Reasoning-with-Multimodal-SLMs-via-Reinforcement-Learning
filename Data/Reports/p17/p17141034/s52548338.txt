                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Shoulder radiograph of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously reported 7 mm diameter nodular opacity in the left
 lower lung is again demonstrated, as well as multiple additional subcentimeter
 nodules throughout both lungs.  A dominant mass is present in the superior
 segment of the right lower lobe, measuring at least 6.5 cm in diameter, with
 adjacent right hilar, and likely mediastinal nodal involvement in the
 subcarinal and possibly the azygos nodal stations.  A subtle interstitial
 pattern is also present in the right mid and lower lung regions.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  Heart size is normal.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Large superior segment right lower lobe mass is consistent with a primary lung
 cancer. Associated intrathoracic lymph node enlargement, widespread pulmonary
 metastases and possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  
 
 Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended, as entered
 into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
