                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increasing opacity in the right lower and probably middle
 lobes with air bronchograms concerning for pneumonia including a small
 suspected pleural effusion.  A decubitus view may be useful if further
 assessment of the effusion is desired.   A small nodular focus projecting over
 the right lung apex reflects a lung nodule seen on the prior CT.  A left
 apical nodule is also visible while other small nodules are not well seen on
 radiography.  Sclerotic metastases involving the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies
 are not optimally visualized, particularly the L1 metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right basilar opacification including a pleural
 effusion.
