                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No aortic valve
 calcifications. No acute fractures are identified. Right scapula and clavicle
 appear irregular and suggestive of either post-surgical changes or congenital
 abnormalities. Diminished vasculature is also noted in the right upper lobe
 but may be due to decreased soft tissues in this region. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Right scapula and clavicle appear irregular and suggestive of either
 post-surgical changes, post-infectious or congenital abnormalities. Please
 correlate with prior history and imaging.
