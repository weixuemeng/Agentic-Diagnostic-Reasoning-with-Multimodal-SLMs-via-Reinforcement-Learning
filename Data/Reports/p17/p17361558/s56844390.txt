                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the
 stomach.  Subcutaneous gas along the upper abdomen and lower chest appears to
 be somewhat increasing.  There are bilateral atelectatic changes with multiple
 right rib fractures and adjacent loculated pleural effusion.
