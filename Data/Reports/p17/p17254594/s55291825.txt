                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with suboxone and heroin overdose, possible
 Tylenol overdose, with cough and possible aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 bilateral confluent opacifications in the dependent areas of the lower lungs
 posteriorly.  Patchy opacifications in the mid and upper lungs are also noted.
 There is some upper mediastinal widening and hilar prominence likely due to
 vascular distention but lymphadenopathy could appear similar.  Heart size is
 top normal and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral lower lobe dependent consolidation, which could be due
 to clinically suspected aspiration, but infection and edema may have a similar
 appearance radiographically.  Multifocal patchy opacities in the mid and upper
 lungs could represent coexisting pulmonary edema or additional sites of
 aspiration. Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution. 
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at ___, 5 minutes after the finding was discovered.
