                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:47 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with severe COPD and prior intubation, now with
 shortness of breath, cough and chest radiograph of multifocal pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe nearly confluent and symmetric bilateral pulmonary opacification
 obscures what were smaller foci of probable pneumonia in the right mid lung
 laterally.  The new process, accompanied by mild mediastinal vascular
 engorgement is probably edema, not necessarily cardiogenic, or diffuse
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  I doubt that pneumonia would develop and coalesce so
 quickly.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
