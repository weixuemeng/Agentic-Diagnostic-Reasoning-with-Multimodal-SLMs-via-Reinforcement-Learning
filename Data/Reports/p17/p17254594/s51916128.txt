                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, increased sputum, wheezing throughout, elevated BNP and
 possible NSTEMI.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Perihilar haziness is noted with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Focal patchy opacity within the right upper to mid lung field is
 again noted.  Patchy opacity is also demonstrated within the left lung base. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Bilateral breast implants are re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities within the left lung
 base and right upper to mid lung field are nonspecific, and could reflect
 areas of infection.
