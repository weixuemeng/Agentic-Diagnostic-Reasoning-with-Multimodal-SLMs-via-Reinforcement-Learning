                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  New areas of opacification are demonstrated within the right lower
 lobe compatible with pneumonia.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen. 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis though an
 additional site of infection cannot be excluded.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New areas of opacification in the right lower lobe compatible with pneumonia. 
 Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis or additional
 area of pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion.
