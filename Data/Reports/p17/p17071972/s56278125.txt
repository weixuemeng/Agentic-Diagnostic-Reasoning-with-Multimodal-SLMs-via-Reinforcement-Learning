                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy with cough, crackles, dyspnea 
 // evaluate for acute change, edema, atelectasis, consolidation      evaluate
 for acute change, edema, atelectasis, consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Right chest tube remains in place and there is no definite
 pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacification most likely reflects a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 most likely indicates some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Lucency beneath the right hemidiaphragm raises the possibility of
 pneumoperitoneum related to recent surgery. The tip of the nasogastric tube is
 within the neo esophagus.
