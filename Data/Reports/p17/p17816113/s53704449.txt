                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, congestion ? fever.  // ? pneumonia  
 ? pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Large mediastinal fat collection makes it difficult to decide whether there is
 consolidation in the lingula.  Lungs are otherwise clear, although mildly
 hyperinflated.  Oblique views may be helpful.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged, but pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable and there is no edema or pleural effusion.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If definitive radiographic assessment regarding pneumonia
 is necessary before initiating treatment, I recommend oblique chest
 radiographs, shown to a radiologist before the patient leaves the department.
