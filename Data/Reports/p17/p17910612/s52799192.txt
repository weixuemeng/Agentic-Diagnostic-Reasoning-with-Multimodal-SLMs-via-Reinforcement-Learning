                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:18 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Two views are submitted.  The examination marked 7:27 shows a nasogastric tube
 ending at the segmental level in the right lower lobe bronchial tree.  This
 study marked 7:56 shows the nasogastric tube has been repositioned in the low
 esophagus and would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports into
 the stomach.  Mild pulmonary edema has recurred, largely in the right lung,
 making it difficult to exclude concurrent pneumonia.  Small right pleural
 effusion has not changed since ___.  Pneumoperitoneum is decreasing. 
 Severe cardiomegaly and moderate-to-severe left lower lobe atelectasis have
 both worsened.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube and right
 subclavian central venous line are in standard placements, unchanged. 
 Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified throughout, but not focally dilated.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:18 a.m., one minute following recognition of the
 radiographic findings which we discussed by telephone at 9:20AM.
