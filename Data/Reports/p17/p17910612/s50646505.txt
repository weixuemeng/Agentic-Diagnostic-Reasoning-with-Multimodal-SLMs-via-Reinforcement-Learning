                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive event with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an
 endotracheal tube in place with the tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
 Opacification at the right base is again consistent with pleural effusion and
 underlying atelectasis.  The hazy opacification on the left has substantially
 decreased.  This may reflect change in patient position with re-distribution
 of previously described effusion.
 
 There is a substantial amount of intraperitoneal gas.  Presumably related to
 the recent PEG insertion, though the substantial amount of gas has been
 conveyed to Dr. ___.
