                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ongoing cough, sob, ?.LLL pna  // r.o pna   
 r.o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, read
 in conjunction with chest CT scanning most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild hyperinflation is unchanged, indicating small airway obstruction.  There
 is no focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size, given the large
 lung volumes, is top-normal but there is no pulmonary edema or pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 Moderately extensive asbestos related pleural plaque, some calcified, is
 unchanged since the previous study and although there is no pleural effusion,
 lung lesion, or other strong suggestion of intrathoracic malignancy, or
 indication of developing pulmonary fibrosis, these determinations are made
 more reliably with chest CT scanning
