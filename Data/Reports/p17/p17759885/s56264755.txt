                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough for several months  // ild,
 effusion, pna      ild, effusion, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the lateral view, an oval ___ x 11 mm opacity projecting over the upper
 aspect of the lowest fully visible thoracic vertebral body could be an
 osteophyte, likely osteophytes on the lower endplate of the vertebral body
 just above, or the superimposition of normal structures, but I can't exclude a
 small lung nodule.  Hopefully, repeat lateral views, in shallow obliquity,
 will be able to distinguish among these possibilities.  In all other respects
 the lungs are clear.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Shallow oblique lateral views, should be shown to a
 radiologist before the patient leaves the department to see if additional
 imaging or even CT scanning is necessary.
