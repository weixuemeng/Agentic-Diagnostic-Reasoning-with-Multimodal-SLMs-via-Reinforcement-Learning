                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, reduced breath sounds on
 right, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is present.  Thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated but has not undergone any
 significant interval change since the preceding examination ___ years ago. 
 No local new aortic contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  As before, however, the marked distortion of
 the peripheral pulmonary vasculature is noted, consistent with the previous
 diagnosis of COPD, bronchiectasis and scarrings already diagnosed as early as
 ___ chest CT.  Comparison of the present abnormalities with the
 appearance of the lungs on the next preceding chest examination of ___, indicates an increased diffuse haze in the right lower lobe area as well
 as in the right middle lobe, consistent with an exacerbation of the chronic
 changes.  Although one cannot identify a well described discrete pneumonic
 infiltrate, the now described findings are consistent with some diffuse
 inflammatory changes present on the previous study.  As they match the
 clinical findings, it is recommended to have a followup examination in about
 ___ weeks.
