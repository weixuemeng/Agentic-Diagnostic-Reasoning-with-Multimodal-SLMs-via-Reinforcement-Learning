 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Community-acquired pneumonia with spiking fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the basal component of the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacity is slightly more extensive.  In addition,
 increasing areas of atelectasis are seen.  Moderate cardiomegaly without
 pulmonary edema.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.
