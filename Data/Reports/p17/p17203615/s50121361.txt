                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis, hx aspiration pna, cp  //
 r/o pna      r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs currently available, study
 is read in conjunction with images of the chest on torso CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the abdomen CT performed ___ there were small bilateral pleural
 effusions and mild interstitial edema. This radiograph shows moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and distension of mediastinal and
 pulmonary vasculature as well as a more serious interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality, presumably worsened edema. Because some of the pulmonary
 abnormality has a micronodular quality, I would recommend conventional
 radiographs when feasible.
