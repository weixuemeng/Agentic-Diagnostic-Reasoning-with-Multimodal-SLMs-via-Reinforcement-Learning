                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD stents with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are low lung volumes and extensive soft
 tissues in the patient, which may accentuate the size of the cardiac
 silhouette and mediastinum.  Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could
 reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure or merely be a manifestation
 of low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 There are midline sternal wires in place, the upper three of which are broken.
