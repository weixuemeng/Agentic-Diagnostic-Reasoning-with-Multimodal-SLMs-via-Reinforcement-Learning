                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is a band-like
 opacity at the left lower lung, which is new from prior study and given the
 associated volume loss is likely to represent atelectasis.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Given the low lung volumes, there is no obvious
 consolidation or overt signs of edema.  The heart and mediastinal contours
 appear normal.  No bony abnormalities are seen.  Distended gas-filled loops of
 bowel in the upper abdomen are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal atelectasis.  Limited exam due to low lung volumes. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Please refer to subsequent CT of
 the abdomen and pelvis for further details.
