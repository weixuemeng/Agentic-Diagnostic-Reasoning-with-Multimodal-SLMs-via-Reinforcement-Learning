 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with b/l effusions s/p right pigtail ___ with
 1020ml out total s/p left TPC with 1320ml out thus far (minimal entrainment of
 air during procedure).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, there is substantial decrease in left pleural
 effusion, consistent with history of thoracentesis.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small, if any.  The left lung has re-expanded and is grossly
 clear.  Left basal opacity may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.  Mediastinal
 vessels are mildly enlarged without evidence for pulmonary edema.  Moderate to
 severe cardiomegaly is long standing. Sternotomy wires are aligned and intact.
 Aortic knob calcification is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small residual bilateral pleural effusions.
