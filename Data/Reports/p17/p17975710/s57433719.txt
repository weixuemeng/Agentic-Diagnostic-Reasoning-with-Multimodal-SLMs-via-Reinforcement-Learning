                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right middle lobe wedge resection for sarcoid nodules. 
 Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest when compared to the
 prior radiograph demonstrate interval resolution of small right apical
 pneumothorax.  There is increase in lung volumes bilaterally.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm represents volume loss after right middle lobe resection. 
 Stable postoperative appearance at the right lower lung field is noted.  Mild
 right pleural scarring and left basilar atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear with no acute opacity.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 No pleural abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative appearance after right middle lobe wedge
 resection.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
