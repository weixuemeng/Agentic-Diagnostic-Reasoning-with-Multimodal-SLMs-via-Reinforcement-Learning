                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Intubated post medflight transfer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates within the proximal right mainstem bronchus.
 Enteric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach. Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Opacity within the left lung base may
 reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  Peribronchial cuffing
 suggests airway inflammation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right mainstem bronchial intubation. Standard position of the enteric tube.
 2. Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.
 Peribronchial cuffing suggests airway inflammation.
