 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multidrug ingestion, intubated  // ? pulm
 edema, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Enteric tube is unchanged in position.
 
 Bronchovascular markings are accentuated by very low lung volumes.  There is
 decreased opacification of the left hemithorax, which may reflect improving
 pleural effusion or semi-erect positioning.  There is also left lung base
 atelectasis. No new areas of consolidation. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease opacification of left hemithorax, which may reflect improving pleural
 effusion or may be due to semi-erect positioning.  Lateral view would be
 helpful for further evaluation.
