                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded. Irregular opacity at the right base most
 likely reflects atelectasis although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 completely excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 heart is likely normal allowing for AP technique. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Irregular opacity at the right base most likely reflects atelectasis although
 in the right clinical setting pneumonia cannot be excluded.
