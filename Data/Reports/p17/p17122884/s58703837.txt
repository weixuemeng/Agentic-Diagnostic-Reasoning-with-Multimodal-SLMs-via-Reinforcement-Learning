                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A left perihilar
 consolidation has resolved but now there is a new extensive opacity involving
 the posterior left lower lobe which is consistent with pneumonia.  A vague
 opacity in the lateral right upper lobe is probably unchanged and may reflect
 a mild form of chronic scarring in the area.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  A thin anterior flowing syndesmophyte is
 noted along the mid through lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia.
