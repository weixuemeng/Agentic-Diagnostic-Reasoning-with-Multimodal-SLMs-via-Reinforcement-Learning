                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of AML, COPD and recurrent pneumonia
 presenting with 3 days of shortness of breath w/ mildcough.  // Pneumonia,
 effusion, cardiomegaly?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip ends in the low SVC.  The lungs are hyperexpanded with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggesting chronic pulmonary disease,
 unchanged.  Bronchovascular congestion is unchanged.  Small right pleural
 effusion is also minimally changed.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 may indicate a trace left pleural effusion or scarring.  No pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No focal consolidation
 to suggest focal pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bronchovascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
 2.  Persistent small right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion or
 scarring.
 3.  Chronic pulmonary disease.
