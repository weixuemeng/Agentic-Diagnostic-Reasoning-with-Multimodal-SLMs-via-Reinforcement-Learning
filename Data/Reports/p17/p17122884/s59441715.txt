                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___ as
 well as a CT chest from ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fevers and cough, recurring pneumonia, assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are subtle
 poorly defined opacities in the right upper and lower lungs, which likely
 reflect pneumonia.  Subtle effacement of the left heart border is likely due
 to a known fat pad seen previously.  The left lung appears clear.  Tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions are new from prior exam.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures appear intact.  There is no
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  DISH-related changes of the T-spine
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacities in the right upper and lower lungs concerning
 for pneumonia.  Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are new.
