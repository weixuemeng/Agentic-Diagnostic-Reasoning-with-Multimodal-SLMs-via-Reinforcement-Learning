                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, somnolent
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged. There is
 worsening volume loss in the right lung with increased rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures and evidence of right lower lobe collapse, worse since
 the previous radiograph.  Right hilar lymphadenopathy is re- demonstrated, and
 known right lower lobe mass is not well assessed on this current exam, though
 there is abrupt cut off of the right bronchus intermedius in the region of the
 mass compatible with obstruction.  Patchy opacity within the right mid lung
 field may also reflect postobstructive atelectasis or pneumonia.  The left
 lung is hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  Moderate size right
 pleural effusion is increased from the previous study.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Cardiac silhouette size
 is difficult to assess given the presence of right lower lobe collapse.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacification in the right lung base compatible with increased right
 lower lobe collapse and potential post obstructive infection.  Known right
 hilar lymphadenopathy and right lower lobe mass are better visualized on the
 prior PET-CT.  Moderate size right pleural effusion, increased in the
 interval.
