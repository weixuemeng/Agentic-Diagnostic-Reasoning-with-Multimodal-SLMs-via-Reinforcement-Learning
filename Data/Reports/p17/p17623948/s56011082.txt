                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with weight loss, cough, tobacco use, was
 homeless  // eval for lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, nodule      eval for
 lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, nodule
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no previous image available for comparison.  The lung volumes are
 normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.  No evidence of masslike lesions or abnormal pulmonary nodules.
 
 However, in the lung parenchyma surrounding the right hilus, notably in the
 mid and lower lung zones, there is evidence of an ill-defined parenchymal
 opacity with multiple air bronchograms, highly suspicious for pneumonia. 
 Based on the lateral image, the process is likely located in the right lower
 lobe.
 
 No complications such as pleural effusions.
