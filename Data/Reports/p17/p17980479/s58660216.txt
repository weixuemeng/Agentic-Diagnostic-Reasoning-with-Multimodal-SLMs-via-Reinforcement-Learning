                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggests
 underlying emphysema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes are present within both
 glenohumeral joints with marked narrowing of the right acromiohumeral interval
 suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Emphysema.
