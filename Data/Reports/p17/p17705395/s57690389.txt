                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased patchy opacifications in the left mid and lower lung
 zones as well as possibly the right lower lung, likely reflect pneumonia,
 possibly lingula with some involvement of the right lung base.  Mediastinal,
 hilar and cardiac contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.  No osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of left mid and lower lung zones as well
 as right lower lung may reflect lingular pneumonia with possible right lower
 lung involvement.
