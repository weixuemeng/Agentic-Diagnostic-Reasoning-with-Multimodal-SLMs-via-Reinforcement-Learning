                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with lung cancer, fever and cough. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and PET-CT on ___. Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Postoperative changes in the right lung are redemonstrated, with loss of
 volume and tenting of the right hemidiaphragm. There are bilateral increased
 interstitial opacities compatible with interstitial edema. The right hilum is
 engorged and there is loss of the normal contour of the hilar bronchovascular
 bundles, compatible with hilar adenopathy and radiation changes better seen in
 recent PET-CT. A right middle lobe nodule seen on recent chest CT cannot be
 properly assessed in this radiograph given superimposition of bony structures.
 No focal opacities are seen in the left lung. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of mild cardiomegaly. Right hilar
 engorgement is compatible with hilar adenopathy and radiation changes better
 seen on recent PET-CT. A right middle lobe nodule seen on recent chest CT
 cannot be properly assessed in this radiograph given superimposition of bony
 structures.
