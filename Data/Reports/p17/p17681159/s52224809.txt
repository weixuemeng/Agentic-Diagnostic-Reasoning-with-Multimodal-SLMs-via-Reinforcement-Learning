                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, crackles throughout the right
 lung fields, now with generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  The patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  Mass within the
 medial aspect of the right lower lobe is unchanged, and innumerable nodules
 are noted throughout both lungs.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged mass within the medial aspect of the right lower lobe, likely
 reflective of the primary malignancy, and innumerable nodules throughout the
 lungs compatible with metastatic disease.
