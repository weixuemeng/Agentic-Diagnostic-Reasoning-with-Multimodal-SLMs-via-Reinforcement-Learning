                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___ and radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable, including a mass
 along the right cardiophrenic angle.  On CT, it had been noted that this had
 increased somewhat since the earlier radiographs, although small changes are
 difficult to judge on radiography.  A few of the nodules seen on CT are
 visible radiographically.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings associated with known malignancy, but no evidence for
 superimposed acute disease.
