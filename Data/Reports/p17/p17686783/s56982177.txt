                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with a large left pleural effusion after thoracentesis
 of 2 L.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The small to moderate left pleural effusion is substantially smaller since
 earlier in the day and mediastinum has returned to the midline.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A coarse interstitial abnormality, as seen on ___
 preceded the development of this large pleural effusion, and is therefore not
 re-expansion edema, instead most likely disseminated carcinomatosis.  Multiple
 lung nodules, particularly in the right middle lobe, the have been growing
 since ___.  Right supraclavicular central venous infusion port
 scans in the upper right atrium.  Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead is
 continuous from the left axillary pacemaker to the floor of the right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small moderate residual left pleural effusion, is primarily dependent, but not
 necessarily layering.  Diffuse carcinomatosis left lung and multiple pulmonary
 metastases predominantly in the right lung unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
