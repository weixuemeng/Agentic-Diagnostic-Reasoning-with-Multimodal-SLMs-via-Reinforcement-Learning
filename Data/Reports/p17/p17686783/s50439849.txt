                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 Current AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate large left pleural
 effusion, substantially larger than back on ___ radiograph and
 also larger than on CT torso from ___.  Right upper lobe mass
 appears to be partially obscured by pleural effusion.  Multiple pulmonary
 nodules seen on the CT torso can be also identified on the chest radiograph. 
 There is also increase in the right middle lobe consolidation.  No substantial
 right pleural effusion is seen, although small amount of fluid cannot be
 excluded.  The Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of right
 atrium.  The pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle.
