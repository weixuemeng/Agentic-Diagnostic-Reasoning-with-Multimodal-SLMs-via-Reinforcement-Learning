                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Brain metastases, lung cancer, and seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs, ___ CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with lead terminating in the right ventricle,
 unchanged.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip also is re- demonstrated anterior
 terminates within the proximal right atrium, unchanged.  Left basilar chest
 tube is re- demonstrated, in similar location.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Hazy opacification of the right
 lung is new compared to the prior exam and could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema or infection.  Increased interstitial and nodular opacities within the
 left lung are similar compared to the prior study with unchanged dominant
 lesion in the left mid lung field, previously demonstrated to be located along
 the major fissure.  Moderate size left pleural effusion is unchanged.  No
 right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Known nodular opacities
 within the right lung are better demonstrated on the prior CT.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Inferior vena cava filter is visualized within the upper
 abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New hazy opacification of the right lung which could reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or an atypical infectious process.
 
 2. Lesion along the left major fissure as well as multiple other smaller
 nodules in both lungs are relatively unchanged, compatible with metastatic
 disease.  Interstitial opacities in the left lung are compatible with
 lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
 
 3. Moderate size left pleural effusion.
