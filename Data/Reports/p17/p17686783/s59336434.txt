                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status after seizure, assess for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  Increased interstitial
 abnormality throughout the upper and mid left lung is suspicious, given its
 asymmetric nature, for an infectious process, including atypical organisms. 
 Left midlung and multiple right-sided metastases are better assessed on the
 recent CT torso.  The heart is normal in size with single lead defibrillator
 noted.  Port-a-Cath terminates in the right atrium as on the CT.  Blunting of
 the costophrenic sulci posteriorly could reflect trace pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased interstitial abnormality in the left upper and mid lung is
 suspicious for an infectious process, potential etiologies include atypical or
 viral pathogens. 
 
 2.  Pulmonary metastases better assessed on recent CT.
