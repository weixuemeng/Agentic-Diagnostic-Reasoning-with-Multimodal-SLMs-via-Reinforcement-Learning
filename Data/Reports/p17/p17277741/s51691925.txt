                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough, syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 increase in opacity at the right lung base most likely relates to atelectasis,
 although an underlying early consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung demonstrates mild retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in right base opacity may relate to atelectasis,
 although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
