                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // evaluate effusions, atx     
 evaluate effusions, atx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have generally improved and the cardiomediastinal silhouette has
 a normal postoperative appearance.  A flame shaped opacity projecting over the
 left upper lung is more obvious following resolution of previous left-sided
 atelectasis and decreasing left pleural effusion.  It was not present
 preoperatively.  It is either loculated pleural fluid or upper lobe
 consolidation.  Because of this location, I cannot attribute it to atelectasis
 and pneumonia is therefore the major concern.
 Right jugular sheath ends just above the thoracic inlet.  No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs to distinguish left upper
 lobe pneumonia from loculated pleural effusion.
