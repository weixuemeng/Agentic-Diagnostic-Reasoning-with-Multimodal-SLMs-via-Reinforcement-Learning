                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with headache and hypertension, new PICC placement, evaluate for
 placement..
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs dating back to
 ___. Comparison is also made to CTA from ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC ends in the proximal to mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires are
 present. Moderate cardiomegaly, mildly increased from prior. Interstitial
 edema persists, similar to prior. There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, consistent with a left-sided pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity
 likely represents atelectasis. A rounded density in the left upper lobe likely
 corresponds to mass seen on prior CT scan.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left PICC ends in the proximal to mid SVC.
 2. Persistent cardiomegaly and left pleural effusion.
 3. Interstitial edema.
 4. Redemonstrated left apical mass like opacity corresponding to lesion seen
 in this location on prior CT scan.
