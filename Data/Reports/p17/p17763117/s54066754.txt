                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Right back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiographs dated
 ___ in correlation with CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pneumothorax or
 significant pleural effusion is present.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  There
 are multiple calcified nodules consistent with prior granulomatous disease. 
 However, a right upper lobe nodule measuring 9 mm is concerning.  This
 previously measured 8 mm on the CT ___ ___, though comparison is limited
 across these modalities.  The heart size is top normal.  There is tortuosity
 and calcification of the thoracic aorta.  A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is
 unchanged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Surgical clips in
 the right upper quadrant are consistent with cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Right upper lobe nodule measuring 9 mm on this examination.  This measured
 8 mm on the prior CT, though comparison across modalities is limited.  Given
 the concerning appearance, this nodule would be better followed by dedicated
 CT.
