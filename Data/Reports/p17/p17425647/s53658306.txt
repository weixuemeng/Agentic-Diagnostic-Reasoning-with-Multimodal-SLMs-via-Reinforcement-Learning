                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with history of recurrent
 pneumonia, presenting with weakness, fever and rigors.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart is moderate to severely enlarged with a prior coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with
 associated unchanged volume loss in the right hemithorax.  There is a
 suspected increased degree of right basilar opacification, probably primarily
 due to a further increase in pleural effusion.  Opacity at the right lung base
 can probably be attributed to atelectasis associated with effusion.  Patchy
 opacities in the right lung have otherwise improved, however.  There is a very
 small suspected new pleural effusion on the left.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected increase in right pleural effusion; improvement in
 parenchymal opacities, however.
