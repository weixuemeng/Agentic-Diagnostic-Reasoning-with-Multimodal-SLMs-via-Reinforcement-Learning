 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous unilateral opacification affecting the right lung and probably due to
 recurrent aspiration pneumonia has nearly cleared.  Small lung lesions, better
 assessed by chest CT scanning have been cited as possible recurrent
 malignancy.  Distortion of right upper posterior rib is due to surgical rib
 fracture.
 
 Left lung is hyperinflated but clear.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  LAD
 coronary stent noted.  Patient has also had median sternotomy for coronary
 bypass grafting.
