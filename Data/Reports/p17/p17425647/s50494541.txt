 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, coronary artery
 disease, worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Coronary artery stenting is also
 noted.  The patient's arm overlies the chest in the lateral view, partially
 obscuring the view.  Given this, in the interval since the prior study, there
 has been increase in moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  Trace left pleural effusion may be present.  Underlying right
 basilar consolidation is not excluded.  Patient is status post right upper
 lobectomy with associated volume loss in the right lung, hemithorax and
 post-surgical changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
