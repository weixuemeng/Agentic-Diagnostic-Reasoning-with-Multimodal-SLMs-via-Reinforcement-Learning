 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension,  lung cancer // Eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are noted with coronaries dense. There is a chronic
 right pleural effusion which may be slightly increased from prior CT. There is
 increased opacity in the right mid to upper lung which raises concern for
 worsening metastatic disease versus a superimposed pneumonia. Scattered
 nodular opacities in the left lung consistent with metastatic disease. The
 heart is stably enlarged. The mediastinal contour is also unchanged. Bony
 structures are intact.
