 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with nausea, weakness and history of cancer, status
 post resection with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is new patchy consolidation at
 the right lung base compatible with a right lower lobe pneumonia.   Volume
 loss in the right hemithorax from prior right upper lobectomy again seen with
 post-thoracotomy changes of the ribs on the right.  There is chronic blunting
 of the left lateral costophrenic angle, potentially due to pleural thickening
 or scar.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  Median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips and coronary artery stents again seen as well as
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  Hypertrophic changes noted in the
 spine.  Surgical clips identified in the upper abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe compatible with
 pneumonia.  Please repeat after treatment to document resolution, especially
 in the setting of patient with prior malignancy.  Chronic changes as detailed
 above.
