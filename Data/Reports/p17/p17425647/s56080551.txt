                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent pneumonias and history of non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Patient is status post
 right upper lobectomy, and there is evidence of loss of volume in the right
 lung.  Increase in the interstitial markings in the lower lobes suggests mild
 interstitial edema.  Aeration of the medial right lower lobe has decreased;
 this could be due to the edema.  There is no evidence of lobar consolidation. 
 Right upper paramediastinal opacity is unchanged, and there is no pneumothorax
 or effusion.  Severe degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Patient is status post CABG.  Right upper
 rib fractures are again noted.  Aeration of the periphery of the lung
 occupying the right upper hemithorax has improved.
