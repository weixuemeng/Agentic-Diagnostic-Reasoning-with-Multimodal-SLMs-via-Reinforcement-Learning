                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, metastatic NSCLC with new O2
 requirement.  // Evaluate for volume overload/PNA      Evaluate for volume
 overload/PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  The layering effusion at the right base is not seen, though this may
 merely represent a more upright position of the patient with and elevated
 right hemidiaphragmatic contour. The increased opacification in the right mid
 to upper lung zone is less prominent, suggesting that this could have been a
 manifestation of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multiple nodules on the left
 again are consistent with metastatic disease.  Otherwise little change.
