                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bicycle accident, landing on left shoulder; question rib
 fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is an acute
 fracture involving the mid shaft of the left clavicle.  The underlying ribs
 appear intact.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No free air is
 seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left clavicular mid shaft fracture, better assessed on the
 dedicated left shoulder/clavicle radiograph.  No definite rib fractures or
 pneumothorax seen.  If there is strong clinical concern for rib fracture,
 dedicated rib series is advised.
