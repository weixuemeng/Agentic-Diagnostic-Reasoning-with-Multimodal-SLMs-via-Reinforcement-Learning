                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with abdominal pain, s/p NGT placement  //
 confirm NG placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube terminates below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the
 stomach but the side port likely at the gastroesophageal junction.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The aorta is minimally
 tortuous.  Streaky opacity at the base of the right lung likely reflects
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube has its tip projecting over the stomach but the side port is at the GE
 junction.  Consider advancing 4-5 cm for ideal positioning.  Right basilar
 patchy atelectasis.
