                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with CHF and post-obstructive pneumonia.  Now with
 stent placement.  Evaluate interval changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There is again seen a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Heart size is prominent, but unchanged.  There is
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of emphysema.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There is atelectasis at the lung bases and
 likely a small right-sided pleural effusion. Several old right-sided rib
 fractures are seen.  There is also a fracture deformity of the right humerus
 at the surgical neck.  Contrast is seen in the transverse colon.  A portion of
 a right humeral head prosthesis is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No significant interval change.  There is atelectasis at the lung bases, small
 right-sided pleural effusion prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
 markings, and emphysematous changes, which are all stable.
