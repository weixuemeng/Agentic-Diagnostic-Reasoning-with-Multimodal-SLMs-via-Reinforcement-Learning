                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is a ___-year-old ___-speaking gentleman with a
 past medical history significant for CAD, diastolic heart failure, COPD (on 4L
 home O2), and aortic stenosis  // eval pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, signs of mild pulmonary edema have
 overall decreased in severity. However, there are new parenchymal opacities
 with air bronchograms at the bases of the left lung. This could be infectious
 in origin.  Calcified pleural plaques are present. Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Clips projecting over the right hilus.  The presence of small pleural
 effusions is likely.
 
 Performance of a repeat radiograph after diuresis is recommended to further
 evaluate potential pleural changes and the morphology at the right
 postoperative hilus.
