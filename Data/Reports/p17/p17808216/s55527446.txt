                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the descending aorta.
 Multiple clips are again noted about the right hilum compatible with prior
 lobectomy.  Calcified pleural plaques are again seen bilaterally. Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again seen.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right are re- demonstrated. Moderate pulmonary
 edema appears worse in the interval.  No pneumothorax is detected. Patchy
 opacity in the left lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis. Rib
 deformities on the right likely reflect postoperative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval, with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.
