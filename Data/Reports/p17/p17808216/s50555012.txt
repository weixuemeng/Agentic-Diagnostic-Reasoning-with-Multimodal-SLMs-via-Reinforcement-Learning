                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increasing dyspnea and hypoxia  // ?chf
 ?other lung dis  ?ca  ? still infiltrates  no clinical pmeumonia      ?chf
 ?other lung dis  ?ca  ? still infiltrates  no clinical
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there may be some increase in the
 left pleural effusion. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with diffuse
 chronic pulmonary disease and pleural thickening with dense calcification in
 the pleura along the right hemidiaphragm.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacification most likely reflecting atelectatic change.
