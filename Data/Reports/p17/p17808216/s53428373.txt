                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure with worsening hypoxia and
 tachycardia. Evaluate for pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, there has been improved aeration at the right base. 
 Two, now confluent left lower lobe and a consolidative right upper lobe
 opacity are all worsening. There is new mild pulmonary edema which obscures
 diffuse micronodules seen in ___ and earlier in this admission. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged and heavy pleural calcification,
 probably due to asbestos exposure, is long-standing. . There is no
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in size, including
 clips along the right heart border and moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema. Increasing moderate cardiomegaly.
 2.  Enlarging regions of likely bilateral infection not fully characterized by
 radiography. Diffuse micronodular abnormality is probably disseminated
 infection or malignancy.  Consider a CT for further evaluation.
 3.  Asbestos pleural calcifications.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 1:23 PM, 15 minutes after discovery of the findings.
