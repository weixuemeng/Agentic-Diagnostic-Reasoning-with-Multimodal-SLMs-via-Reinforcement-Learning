 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough.  // ___ year old man with cough.     
 COUGH 1 MONTH NO FEVER PER PT R/O INFILTRATE
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion
 of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease with pleural thickening
 and blunting of the costophrenic sinuses as well as postsurgical changes at
 the right hilum and resection of the right upper rib.  Continued cardiomegaly
 and pleural calcification bilaterally. .
 There is the suggestion of an area of increased opacification at the left
 base. Although this could merely be a manifestation of chronic pulmonary
 disease and atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
