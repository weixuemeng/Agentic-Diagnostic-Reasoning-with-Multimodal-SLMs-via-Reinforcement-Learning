 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bronchitis, expectorations.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Signs of marked overinflation.  Pleural calcifications with clips
 at the right hilus and right rib defect likely resulting from prior right
 lobectomy.  Pleural thickening is present in both lungs, leading to blunting
 of the costophrenic sinuses.  Peribronchial thickening suggests chronic
 airways disease.  Moderate cardiomegaly with no signs indicative of pulmonary
 edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
