                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an ___-year-old man with hypoxia, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable semi-upright view of the chest was provided. 
 There is left lung base opacification which could represent a combination of
 effusion and atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A trace right
 pleural effusion is also seen.  There is mild interstitial congestion.  Heart
 size is difficult to assess.  Atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic
 knob noted.  Patient is slightly rotated to his left somewhat limiting the
 evaluation.  No pneumothorax.  The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation at the left lung base could represent atelectasis
 and/or pneumonia with moderate left and small right pleural effusion.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion also noted.
