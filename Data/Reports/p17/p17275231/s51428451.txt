                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fevers to 101 and cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A CBD stent in
 the right upper quadrant is again noted as well as a catheter in the anterior
 upper abdomen with adjacent surgical clips.  There is no definite sign of
 pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A subtle nodular opacity
 adjacent to the left heart border in the left lower lung is seen on the
 frontal view, possibly may represent a new pulmonary nodule as it was not
 clearly seen on the prior exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. 
 The hyperinflated widened AP diameter reflects known underlying emphysema. 
 Bony structures appear intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema, possible nodule in the left lower lung.  Recommend
 non-emergent CT to assess further.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.
