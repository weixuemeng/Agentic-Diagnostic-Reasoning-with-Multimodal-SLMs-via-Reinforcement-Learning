                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHB s/p PPM now with pericardial effusion 
 // evaluation of PPM lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 00:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen trans subclavian  AV pacer has been converted to a
 conventional left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The right Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 similar.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or gross effusion is detected.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis and possible minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, allowing for technical
 differences.
 2. Left-sided dual lead pacer, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 3. Doubt acute pulmonary process.  Possible minimal blunting of left
 costophrenic angle and minimal bibasilar atelectasis .
