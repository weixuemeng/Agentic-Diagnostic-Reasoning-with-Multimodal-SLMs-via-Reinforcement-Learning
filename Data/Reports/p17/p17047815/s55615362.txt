 HISTORY:  Left arm pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The
 arch is calcified.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is a vague patchy right basilar opacity, most
 suggestive of minor scarring or atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the right lower lung suggesting minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Mild cardiomegaly.
