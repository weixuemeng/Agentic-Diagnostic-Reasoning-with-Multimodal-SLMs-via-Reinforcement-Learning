                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased interstitail markings are seen in the lungs with most confluent
 basilar opacities most significant at the right lung base.  There is a small
 to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, and a
 probable small left pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Redemonstrated is a left pectoral pacemaker
 with 2 intact leads seen terminating within the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively. A right upper extremity vascular stent is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  More confluent basilar opacities in
 part due to effusions and atelectasis although infection is also possible.
