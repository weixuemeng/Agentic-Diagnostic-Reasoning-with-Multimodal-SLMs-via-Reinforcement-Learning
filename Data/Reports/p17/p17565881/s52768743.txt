                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Thoracic aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions with streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is chronic.  No overt pulmonary edema is present
 although crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted due to low lung
 volumes.  There is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are noted in both
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
