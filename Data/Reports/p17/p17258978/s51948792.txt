                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F PMHx IgA nephropathy s/p living relative renal transplant
 (___) on Sirolimus and methylprednisone, presenting from an OSH w/ concern
 for multifocal pneumonia.  // Worsening pulmonary edema vs
 consolidation/infiltrate.    Worsening pulmonary edema vs
 consolidation/infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation at the base the left lung has improved since ___.  Less
 severe consolidation on the right is not appreciably changed.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions persist.  Heart size is normal.  Upper lungs are clear.  I
 doubt that the abnormality is due to pulmonary edema -more likely
 pneumonia-but its severity may reflect intravascular volume.
