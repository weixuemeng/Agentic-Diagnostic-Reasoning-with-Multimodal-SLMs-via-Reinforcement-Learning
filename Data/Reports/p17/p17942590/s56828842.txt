                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left rib pain after fall, evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 SINGLE PA VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear, there is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no airspace consolidation.  Slight
 irregularity of the anterior aspect of the fifth and sixth ribs is suggestive
 of possible fracture.  Overlying hyperdensity may represent a soft tissue
 hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible left fifth and sixth rib fractures.  Better evaluation
 may be performed with a dedicated rib series.
