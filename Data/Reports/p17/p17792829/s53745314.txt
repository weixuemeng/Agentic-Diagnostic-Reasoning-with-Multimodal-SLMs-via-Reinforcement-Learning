                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with unwitnessed fall and cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted with the patient's
 upper arms overlying the retrosternal airspace on the lateral view.  Crowding
 of interstitial markings at both lung bases appears to be related to degree of
 inspiration and no definite consolidation suggestive of pneumonia is seen.  No
 pneumothorax or rib fracture is evident.  Compared to the most recent prior
 study from ___ years ago (___), there is irregularity of the
 upper humeral heads, but no suspicious focal osseous lesion is seen.  Heart
 and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits in size and shape and
 thoracic vertebral bodies are of maintained height.  Calcified plaque is seen
 in the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pneumonia or acute fracture seen.
