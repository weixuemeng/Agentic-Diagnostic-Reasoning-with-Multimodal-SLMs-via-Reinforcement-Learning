 ___ year old woman s/p pleurx placement reeval per IP request
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest tube is now located lower within the right hemithorax, with its
 tip projecting over the ascending aorta.  There has been interval near
 resolution of a large right pleural effusion.  Prominent opacities in the
 medial middle and lower right lung may reflect a combination of known hilar
 mass, pneumonia, or re-expansion edema.  Linear atelectasis at the left lung
 base is new.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is unchanged.  A right main stem
 bronchus stent is noted.  Prominent gas over the right upper quadrant appears
 to be intraluminal, likely colonic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nearly resolved right pleural effusion status-post right chest tube
 adjustment.  No pneumothorax.  Mid and right lower lung opacities may reflect
 a combination of known right hilar mass, pneumonia, and/or re-expansion
 pulmonary edema.
