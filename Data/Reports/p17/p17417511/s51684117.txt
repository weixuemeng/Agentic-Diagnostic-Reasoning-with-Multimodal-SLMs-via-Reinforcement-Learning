                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, smoking history  // r/o mass     
 r/o mass
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  There is a newly appeared parenchymal opacity
 at the bases of the right upper lobe.  This opacity.  Likely represents
 pneumonia.
 
 More importantly, however, is an associated substantial enlargement of the
 right hilus, visible on both the frontal and the lateral radiograph, causing
 partial effacement of the paratracheal stripe.  The change could theoretically
 represent reactive lymphadenopathy, but is nonetheless highly suggestive for
 the presence of a central neoplasm.  CT must be performed to workup this
 change.
 
 Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Normal size of the heart.  No
 pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT must be performed to rule out the presence of a right
 central neoplasm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  At the time of dictation and observation, the findings and the
 recommendations were entered into the radiology dashboard system.
