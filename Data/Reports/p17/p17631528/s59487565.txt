                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with metastatic rectal cancer status post radiation
 therapy on ___ now with fever to 103
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Innumerable bilateral
 pulmonary nodules have progressed since the previous chest radiograph, and
 allowing for differences in technique, are not substantially changed from the
 previous CT where many were shown to be centrally cavitating. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable pulmonary metastases, grossly unchanged from the previous CT.  No
 new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
