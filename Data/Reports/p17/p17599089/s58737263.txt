                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent smoke exposure  // Is there an
 intrapulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are n hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease. There is increased opacity at the right lung base, which could be due
 to underlying infection or aspiration. There appears to be perihilar
 peribronchial thickening. No large pleural effusion is seen although a trace
 right pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest COPD.  Right basilar patchy opacity could be due to infection
 or aspiration.  Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views for better evaluation
 when patient able. Difficult to exclude trace right pleural effusion.
