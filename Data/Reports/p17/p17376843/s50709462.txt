                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man chronically immunosuppressed, with prolonged URI
 earlier this month, now with persistent cough and dullness to percussion of
 the left lower lobe  // ?pleural effusion, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Branching nodular opacities in the left upper lobe, as well as linear and
 irregular opacities in the lingula.  The right lung is relatively clear. 
 Heart size is normal.  The hila are unremarkable.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal nodular opacities in the left upper lobe can represent
 bronchopneumonia.  Irregular opacities in the lingula have a more chronic
 appearance may be the sequelae of prior infection.  If prior imaging is
 available for comparison, the images can be reviewed and an addendum dictated.
 Otherwise follow-up chest radiograph in 4 weeks is suggested to ensure
 resolution.
