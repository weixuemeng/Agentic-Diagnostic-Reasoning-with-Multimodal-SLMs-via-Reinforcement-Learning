                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable supine view of the chest reveals endotracheal tube that
 terminates in the left mainstem bronchus and should be retracted for better
 positioning.  The lung volumes are low which cause vascular crowding.  The low
 lung volumes may also be contributing to the right lower lobe opacities,
 although aspiration is certainly a consideration as well.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is present.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left mainstem intubation.  ET tube should be retracted for better
 positioning.
 
 2. Right lower lobe opacities, aspiration versus atelectasis.
