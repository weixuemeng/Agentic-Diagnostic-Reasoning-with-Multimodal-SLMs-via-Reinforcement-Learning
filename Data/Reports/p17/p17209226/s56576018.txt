                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough, AMS  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ CTA.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly which appears to have progressed but this is
 likely in part due projection and lower lung volumes. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen in the aorta which is tortuous. Enlarged hila are
 compatible with enlarged pulmonary arteries in the setting of pulmonary
 hypertension. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen but there is no
 confluent consolidation or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with signs suggesting pulmonary hypertension and vascular
 congestion.
