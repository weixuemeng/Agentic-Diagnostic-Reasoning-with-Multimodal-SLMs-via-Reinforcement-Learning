 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___ at 10:44.

 Lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature more engorged, and
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is wider, pointing to volume overload or cardiac
 decompensation.  Focal abnormality at the right lung base is most likely
 atelectasis.
 
 Mediastinal caliber and right Lung should be followed closely to exclude
 mediastinal bleeding and pneumonia, respectively.  Subsequent chest radiograph
 available the time of this review shows a benign course to both findings.
