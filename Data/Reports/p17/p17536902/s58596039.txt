 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:05 AM
  
  
  
  Compared with the chest radiograph from the prior day, there are continued
  dense atelectatic streaks in the right lung base.  No change in the appearance
  of the superior mediastinum.  Opacification at the left lung base with
  silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the
  left lower lobe and a small pleural effusion.
