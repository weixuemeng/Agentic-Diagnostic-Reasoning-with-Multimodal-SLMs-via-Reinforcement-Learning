                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A left-sided cardiac generator pack
 projects leads into the right ventricle and atrium.  Coarse widespread
 reticular opacities across both lungs are again seen.  A previously seen right
 basilar opacity on the ___ chest radiograph appears improved.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar densities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic-appearing widespread reticular opacities. No superimposed
 acute process.
