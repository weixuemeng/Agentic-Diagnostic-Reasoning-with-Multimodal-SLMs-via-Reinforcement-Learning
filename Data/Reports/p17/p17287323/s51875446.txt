                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is a moderately severe
 thoracic scoliosis convex to the right with a more severe lower compensatory
 curve convex to the left centered at the thoracolumbar junction.  Clips are
 projected over the left hypochondrium.  None of these findings are changed
 from prior study.  On today's examination, the cardiomediastinal contour
 appears normal, and the lungs are grossly clear.  The left costophrenic sulcus
 and posterior costophrenic recess appear sharper on today's examination.
 
 There is an impression of a rounded ring on the lateral view unchanged from
 before, which may represent a valve replacement.
 
 Conclusion
 
 No acute findings
