                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough and chills, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are ___ midline median sternotomy suture wires and multiple
 mediastinal surgical clips.  The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous, similar to
 prior.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, and within
 normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  New since prior is the
 development of retrocardiac opacification and silhouetting of the medial left
 hemidiaphragm.  Lateral view demonstrates posterior lower lung opacification. 
 Findings overall are compatible with consolidation involving the left lower
 lobe.  The remainder of the left lung is clear.  The right lung is clear. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity compatible with left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
