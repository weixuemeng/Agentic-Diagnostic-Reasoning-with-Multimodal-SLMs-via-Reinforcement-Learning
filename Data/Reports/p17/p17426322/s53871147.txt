                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC line positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a right PICC line with tip now terminating in the
 upper to mid SVC.  The remainder of the chest radiograph appears unchanged

 opacities may represent developing consolidations, although there is not much
 change overal from the most recent prior study.
