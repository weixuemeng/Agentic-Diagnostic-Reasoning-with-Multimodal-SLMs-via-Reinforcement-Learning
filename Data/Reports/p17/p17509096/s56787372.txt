                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ESRD on dialysis with increasing chest pain,
 shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Coarse interstitial
 opacities are again noted, more pronounced in the periphery of the upper
 lobes, previously thought to reflect NSIP, without substantial interval
 change.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion pneumothorax is present.
 Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  Vascular stent is seen within the region of the
 right subclavian vessels.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease, similar to prior, thought previously to
 reflect NSIP.  No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary
 edema.
