 inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is diffuse moderate pulmonary
 edema and small bilateral pleural effusions compatible with volume overload. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged,
 as before.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
