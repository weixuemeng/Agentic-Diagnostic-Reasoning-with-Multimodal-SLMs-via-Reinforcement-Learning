                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  New bilateral, relatively symmetrical perihilar and basilar
 ground-glass and reticular opacities are present, with some apparent
 associated bronchial wall thickening.  Lung volumes are increased, in keeping
 with history of COPD.  
 
 Heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Bilateral hilar prominence persists, left greater than right, similar
 to baseline CXR of ___.
 
 
 There are no acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New perihilar and basilar ground-glass and reticular opacities
 with associated bronchial wall thickening. 
 
 In the setting of significant immunosuppression, pneumocystis pneumonia should
 be strongly considered.  However, a community-acquired, atypical pneumonia
 could produce a similar imaging pattern.  
 
 Followup chest radiographs are recommended in ___ weeks to document
 resolution.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 2 p.m.
