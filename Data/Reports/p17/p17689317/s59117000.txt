                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with angioedema intubated  // ? tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip located 1.9 cm above the carinal. An orogastric tube extends into the left
 upper abdomen. There is retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis
 versus pneumonia/ aspiration. There is a small left pleural effusion
 suspected. No supine evidence for pneumothorax. Mild right basal atelectasis
 noted. Bony structures appear demineralized though grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip 1.9 cm above the carinal. OG tube positioned appropriately.
 Retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting a combination of consolidation and
 effusion.
