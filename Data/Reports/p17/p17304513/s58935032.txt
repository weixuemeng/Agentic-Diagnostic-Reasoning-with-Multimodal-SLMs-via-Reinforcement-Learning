 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:27 PM
  ETT 6.4 cm above the carina. Diffuse airspace opacities have markedly worsened
  from prior study in only 3 hr ago. Etiology is likely severe pulmonary edema.
  Although this may represent decompensated CHF, noncardiogenic etiologies
  should be considered, such as ARDS. Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
  If there is diagnostic uncertainty, consider obtaining a chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // et placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous study obtained the same date earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient was intubated in the interim with the ET tube being 6.4 cm above
 the carina. Diffuse airspace opacities have markedly worsened from prior study
 in only 3 hr ago. Etiology is likely severe pulmonary edema. Although this may
 represent decompensated CHF, non-cardiogenic etiologies should be considered,
 such as ARDS.  Also extensive hemorrhage is a possibility. Underlying
 infection cannot be excluded. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, consider
 obtaining a chest CT.
