                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p single chamber ICD evaluate for lead
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided single chamber ICD with its
 tip projecting over the expected location of the right ventricle. Relationship
 to the anterior wall of the right ventricle is indeterminate. The lung volumes
 are low, accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette and interstitial
 markings.  Moderate cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary vasculature are
 unchanged. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of mediastinal
 hematoma or hemothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided single-chamber ICD, terminating in the right ventricle, though
 relationship with the anterior ventricular wall cannot be determined.
