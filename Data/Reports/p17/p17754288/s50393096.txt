                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a linear opacity projecting over the right middle lobe likely
 represent atelectasis/scarring.  Subtle right base opacities most likely
 represent atelectasis, however, underlying consolidation is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle right base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis although
 early consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Right middle lobe atelectasis/scarring.
