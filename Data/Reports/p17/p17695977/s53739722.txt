 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with new chest pain, now worsening hypoxia,
 assess for extension of the pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest
 CT.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum, enlarged pulmonary arteries and
 ectatic aorta are better seen in prior CT.  Extensive consolidation of the
 left lung and mild opacities in the right lower lobe are all stable.  There
 are no new lung abnormalities, loss of volume, pneumothorax or pleural
 effusions.
