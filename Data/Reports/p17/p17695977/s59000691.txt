                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Continued dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for pathology.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, which limits evaluation.  There is
 minimal right basilar atelectasis.  The left upper lobe opacity appears to
 have nearly completely resolved; there is possible mild residual scarring or
 atelectasis.  There is no new airspace opacity.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 The mediastinal contours are widened due to the known ectasia and tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  The heart size is enlarged, and unchanged from prior
 exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Unchanged tortuous and ectatic thoracic aorta and cardiomegaly.
