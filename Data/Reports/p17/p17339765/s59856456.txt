                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AML with pneumonia and pleural effusions.  Worsening
 cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest  radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC ends at or just beyond the atriocaval junction.  To be
 confident that it would end in the SVC, could pull back 2 cm.  The large right
 pleural effusion has increased in size.  The large left pleural effusion is
 stable.  Bibasilar associated atelectasis is unchanged.  Given the large
 effusions, cannot exclude underlying pneumonia or other parenchymal
 abnormalities.  The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased size of large right pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable left pleural effusion.
 3.  PICC at or just beyond the superior atriocaval junction.  To be confident
 that it is in the low SVC, could pull back 2 cm.
