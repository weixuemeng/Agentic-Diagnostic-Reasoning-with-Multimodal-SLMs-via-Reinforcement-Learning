 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Leukemia and prolonged neutropenia with multiple line infections.
 Evaluation for shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in extent of the bilateral pleural effusions.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged, with multiple widespread parenchymal opacities, strongly suggesting
 multifocal pneumonia, and underlying pulmonary edema, as documented by
 increased vascular diameter and massive cardiomegaly.
 
 The right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.
