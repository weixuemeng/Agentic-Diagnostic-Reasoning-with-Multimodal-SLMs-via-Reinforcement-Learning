                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:58 P.M.  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions and severe cough after right
 thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Small right pleural effusion is dramatically smaller than it was on ___, but there is a new large area of consolidation in the right mid lung, which
 could be either in the middle or lower lobe.  I suspect this is a complication
 of thoracentesis, either localized reexpansion edema or hemorrhage, but since
 there was substantial atelectasis prior to thoracentesis, I do not know if
 this is necessarily a new finding or newly apparent consolidation that was
 present earlier in previously collapsed lung.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 and left lower lobe consolidation, presumably atelectasis has worsened.  There
 is no longer edema in the upper lungs, but severe enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists.  A right PIC line can be traced as far as the low SVC,
 but the tip is indistinct.
