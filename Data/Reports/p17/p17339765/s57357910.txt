                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with leukemia and worsening
 cough.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip cannot be clearly seen, most likely at the level of
 low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is interval
 increase in bilateral pleural effusions as well as in mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Left perihilar opacity currently is not as prominent, might
 reflect gradual decrease in left perihilar consolidation/atelectasis.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
