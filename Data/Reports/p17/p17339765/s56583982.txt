                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Leukemia, hematocrit drop.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased.  There is also
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe and left perihilar region.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.  Right pleural effusion and right perihilar opacities
 have increased.  The opacities could be due to atelectasis but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Right
 central catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
