 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxia.  Assess for fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrated right PIC catheter
 projecting over mid SVC.  Low lung volumes.  Moderate-to-large bilateral
 pleural effusions have significantly increased in size since prior exam. 
 Cardiac contour is obscured by overlying opacities, which is likely enlarged. 
 Azygous vein appears prominent.  There is pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 consolidations are new since prior exam.  Thickening of right minor fissure is
 again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ exam, there is significant progression of
 moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar consolidations may represent atelectasis, however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
