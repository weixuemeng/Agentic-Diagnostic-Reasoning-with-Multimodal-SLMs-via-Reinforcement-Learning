                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Neutropenia and chest pain.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion is stable to minimally decreased.  Small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette is obscured by
 pleural parenchymal abnormalities.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Left PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities.
