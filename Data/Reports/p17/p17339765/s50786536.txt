                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AML.  Status post left thoracentesis.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC ends in the low SVC.  A left pigtail pleural drainage
 catheter is new.  The left pleural effusion has significantly decreased in
 size.  Mild left basilar atelectasis persists.  A moderate right pleural
 effusion has increased in size with enlargement of the associated
 consolidation, most likely from increasing atelectasis.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is no edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left pleural effusion decreased since placement of pleural drain.
 2.  Increase in size of right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
