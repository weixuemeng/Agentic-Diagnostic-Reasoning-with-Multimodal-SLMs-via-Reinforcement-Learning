                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Fever.  Thoracentesis yesterday.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 10:58 p.m.:
 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged following
 thoracentesis.  Region of dense consolidation in the right mid lung is
 clearing, presumably post-reexpansion edema.  There is also better aeration of
 the previously densely consolidated left lower lobe.  Whether there is a small
 region of pneumonia in the abnormal lower lungs is radiographically
 indeterminate, but if present it is not worsening nor is there any pneumonia
 in the upper lungs.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears improved, but just because
 of differences in from AP to PA projection.  Right PIC line ends in the upper
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
