                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with widespread pneumonia. 
 Possibility of leukemic infiltrate or pulmonary hemorrhage must be considered.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There appears to be
 increased opacification in the right paramediastinal area, possibly also on
 the left, raising the possibility of substantial lymphadenopathy.
 
 PICC line remains in place.
