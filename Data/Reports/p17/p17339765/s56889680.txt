                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison to prior studies is somewhat limited due to apparent
 semi-upright rather than fully upright positioning.  Apparent increase in size
 of moderate-to-large right and moderate left pleural effusions could in part
 be related to the positional differences.  Worsening bibasilar lung opacities
 are probably due to atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusions, but
 underlying infectious process is also possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Diffuse haziness in the upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
