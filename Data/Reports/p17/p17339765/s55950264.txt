                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known AML, known pleural effusions, increasing positional cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pleural
 effusion on the right has minimally decreased.  The effusion on the left is
 unchanged.  Overall, the extent of the effusions is still moderate-to-severe,
 this is better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph. 
 Subsequent areas of bilateral, relatively extensive atelectasis.  The exact
 size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be determined.  Unchanged mild fluid
 overload.
