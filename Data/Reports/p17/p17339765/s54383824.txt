                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right PICC is at or just below the expected level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged but stable
 compared to prior studies.  This likely corresponds to a pericardial effusion
 as demonstrated on prior chest CT of ___.  Bilateral moderate
 pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with associated atelectasis within
 both lower lobes.  Minor degrees of atelectasis are also present in the middle
 lobe and lingula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC, position as described above.
 
 2.  Persistent pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
