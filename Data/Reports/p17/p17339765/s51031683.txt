                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and PA and lateral chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are increased opacities in the lung
 bases, left greater than right.  Findings likely reflect recurrence of
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Underlying consolidation may be due to
 atelectasis, though aspiration or pneumonia, particularly in the left lung
 base, cannot be excluded.  Mild vascular congestion is evident, however, there
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  Detailed evaluation of the hilum and cardiac
 contours is limited due to basilar opacities, but there is marked
 cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right PICC line terminates in the
 mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Recurrence of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left
 and small on the right.  Probable associated underlying bibasilar atelectasis,
 though pneumonia or aspiration, particularly within the left base, cannot be
 entirely excluded. Vascular congestion present.
