                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  AML and recurrent pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right side are
 unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  They are
 associated with large bibasilar atelectasis greater on the left side. 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  There are bilateral mid lung atelectases.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is in the
 lower SVC.
