 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman with leukemia, neutropenia, and fever. 
 Please evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The position of the right-sided PICC line is unchanged.  Heart
 appears enlarged.  Trachea is midline.  There is some widening of mediastinum,
 mainly on the right side of the carina suggestive of a loculated pleural
 effusion.  This does not appear to be significantly changed from the prior
 study.  A small left pleural effusion is stable.  There is some improvement of
 the right-sided atelectatic changes.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marginal improvement of the right lung atelectatic changes
 compared to the previous study, otherwise unchanged.
