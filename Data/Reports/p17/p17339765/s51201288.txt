                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of biphenotypic leukemia,
 disseminated Fusarium infection, enterococcal empyema with recurrent fevers in
 the setting of septic shock and GNR (gram-negative rods) bacteremia, growing
 E. coli, ? new infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Similar as on preceding examination, there is
 evidence of bilateral basal infiltrates partially covered by pleural effusions
 that blunt the lateral pleural sinuses, slightly more on the right than on the
 left.  Comparison does not reveal any new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates or
 increased pleural effusion.  The previously described internal jugular
 approach central venous line remains in unchanged position and the previously
 described cardiomegaly is also unaltered.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, there is no evidence of new pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates as can be excluded on this single AP portable chest
 view examination.
