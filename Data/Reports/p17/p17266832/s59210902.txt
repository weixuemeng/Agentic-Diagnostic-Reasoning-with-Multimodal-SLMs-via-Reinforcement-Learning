 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of right-sided pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided pneumonia
 has substantially decreased in extent and severity.  However, notably on the
 frontal radiograph, remnant opacities are seen at the right lung base.  No new
 parenchymal opacities.  Moderate cardiomegaly and minimal left pleural
 effusion.  Unchanged right-sided and left-sided axillary clips.
