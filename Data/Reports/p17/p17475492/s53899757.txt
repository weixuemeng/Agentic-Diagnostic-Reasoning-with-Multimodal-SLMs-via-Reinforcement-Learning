                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with small-bowel obstruction // please evaluate for
 NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 06:48 chest radiograph from outside institution,
 CT abdomen and pelvis ___ at 07:09 from outside institution, CT chest
 ___ from outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  An enteric tube is demonstrated with tip in the distal
 aspect of the stomach.  Low lung volumes are re- demonstrated.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Peripheral and basilar
 predominant coarse heterogeneous opacities with fibrosis and associated
 bronchiectasis are compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Hypertrophic changes are seen
 within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube tip within the stomach.  Re- demonstration of fibrosing chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
