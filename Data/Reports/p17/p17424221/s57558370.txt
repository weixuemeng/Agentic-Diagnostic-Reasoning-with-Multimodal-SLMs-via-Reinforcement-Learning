                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New diagnosis of multiple myeloma, to assess for pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous chest radiographs.  There is some hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with prominence of interstitial markings, raising the possibility of
 some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  Apical pleural thickening is seen
 bilaterally.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 The rib lesion seen on CT is not definitely appreciated on the plain
 radiographs.
