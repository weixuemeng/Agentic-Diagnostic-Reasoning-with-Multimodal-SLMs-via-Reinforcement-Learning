                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  At least the medial segment of the right middle lobe is collapsed,
 possibly due to bronchial obstruction from mucus or mass.  There is no
 peripheral lung nodule or evidence of substantial lymphadenopathy in the right
 hilus or elsewhere.  There is no consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe or medial segment collapse.  Would evaluate in
 several weeks with a repeat radiograph to check for resolution.  If the lobe
 does not reexpand a CT would be necessary to assess the status of the middle
 lobe bronchus.
 
 Results were telephoned to Dr. ___ at 11:15 a.m. on ___ by Dr. ___.
