                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with abnormality on previous chest
 examination, followup for comparison with chest examination and CT scan.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  Mild cardiac enlargement is present with a
 relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left, posteriorly. 
 This finding in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated thoracic
 aorta consistent with longstanding systemic hypertension.  The pulmonary
 vasculature, however, is not congested.  There is no evidence of any pleural
 effusion on either side.  On previous examination identified triangular-shaped
 density adjacent to the right cardiac contour consistent with and interpreted
 as representing collapse of the right middle lobe medial segment has markedly
 improved, both on the frontal as well on the lateral view.  There remains a
 mild degree of relative under aeration in this area, but progression into
 total atelectasis in this area, possibly related to bronchostenosis or
 inclusion cannot be identified.  No other new pulmonary abnormalities are seen
 and no pneumothorax is present in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of segmental atelectasis in right middle lobe area as
 observed on chest examination six weeks ago.  Unless patient's clinical
 symptomatology has deteriorated, I do not think that one needs to perform a CT
 scan at this time in this elderly female patient.  A further followup chest
 examination in a few weeks may be advisable to document complete normalization
 of the observed findings in the right middle lobe.
