                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with DOE  // SOB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There is central vascular congestion with minimal
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Opacity within the right middle lobe has
 improved since prior study and suggests atelectasis, less likely infection. 
 Trace right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta with calcification
 at the aortic knob.  Otherwise, mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No
 compression deformity in the thoracic spine is visualized on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable mild cardiomegaly with central vascular congestion and mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2. Right middle lobe opacity suggests atelectasis, less likely infection.
