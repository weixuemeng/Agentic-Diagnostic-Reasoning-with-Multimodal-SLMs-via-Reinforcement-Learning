 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Hilar congestion is noted with
 mild interstitial edema.  There is increased opacity in the right middle lobe
 region which may represent atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  Mild blunting
 of the CP angles likely indicates tiny pleural effusions.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is normal aside from a unfolded
 thoracic aorta.  Bony structures are intact with demineralization noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with hilar congestion and mild edema.  Tiny pleural
 effusions.  Opacity in the right middle lobe may represent atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.
