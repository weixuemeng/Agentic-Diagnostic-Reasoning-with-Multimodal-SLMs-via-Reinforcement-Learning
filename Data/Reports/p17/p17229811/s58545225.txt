                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Recent thoracentesis.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  An extensive consolidation in the right upper lung has increased
 both in density and extent.  There is also a developing consolidation in the
 left upper lobe.  A small-to-moderate pleural effusion is seen on the right,
 and probably a trace one which is suspected on the left.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Small-to-moderate right-sided
 pleural effusion, probably similar in size.  Increasing consolidations.
