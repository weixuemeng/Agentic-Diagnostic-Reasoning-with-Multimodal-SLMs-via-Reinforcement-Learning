                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, crackles and squeaks.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is suspicion for
 substantial dilatation of main pulmonary artery as well as right and left
 pulmonary arteries concerning for pulmonary hypertension.  Lymphadenopathy is
 an alternative, although less likely.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Correlation with chest CT for
 assessment of the size of pulmonary arteries and pulmonary hypertension versus
 lymphadenopathy is required.
