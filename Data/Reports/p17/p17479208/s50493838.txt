 HISTORY:  Vocal cord paralysis status post liver transplant, question change
 in pleural effusion aspiration.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Left IJ central line is present, tip in proximalmost SVC.  A nasoenteric type

 Again seen is a moderately large right effusion, essentially unchanged

 atelectasis of the left base is unchanged.  Mild prominence of upper zone
 vessels is also unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 Note is made of a stent or other tubing in the right upper quadrant, clips
 over the right upper quadrant, and a calcified granuloma at the left
 costophrenic angle.
