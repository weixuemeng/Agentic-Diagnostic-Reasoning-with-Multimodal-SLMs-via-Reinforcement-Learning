 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, increasing right upper quadrant pain and leukocytosis,
 status post washout hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The image is compared to ___.  The monitoring and
 support devices are unchanged.  Also unchanged is the right upper abdominal
 drain.  The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved
 ventilation.  The pre-existing extensive right pleural effusion has moderately
 decreased in extent, permitting improved ventilation of the right upper lung
 and reduction in extent of the basal areas of atelectasis.  The true extent of
 the effusion is better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal image.
 
 The signs indicative of mild-to-moderate fluid overload have also decreased in
 severity.  The left lung base is now fully expanded.
 
 No evidence of changes in cardiac ___.  No pneumothorax.  No interval
 appearance of new parenchymal opacities.
