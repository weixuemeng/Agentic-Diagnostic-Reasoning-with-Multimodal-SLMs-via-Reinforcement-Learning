                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right thoracentesis, question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 2:49 p.m.:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is only slightly smaller, but mediastinum has
 returned towards the midline.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left jugular line
 ends in the upper SVC, supraclavicular hemodialysis line ends closer to the
 superior cavoatrial junction and a feeding tube passes into the duodenum and
 out of view.  Vascular congestion in the left lung is explained by severe
 atelectasis caused by pleural effusion on the right.  Heart shadow is enlarged
 but size is difficult to assess because of adjacent pleural effusion.  No left
 pneumothorax.
