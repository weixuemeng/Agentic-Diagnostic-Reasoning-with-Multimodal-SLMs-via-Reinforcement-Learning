                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina above the
 level of clavical. Consider advancing ETT by 2 cms for better seating. Right
 PICC and subclavian line terminates at lower SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter through
 the left internal jugular approach ends approximately at the level of main
 pulmonary artery and is appropriate.  Orogastric tube is seen to course below
 the diaphragm into the stomach and is off radiographic view.  Mild pulmonary
 edema has improved. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased. 
 Increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm
 suggesting lower lung atelectasis has also worsened since ___.
 Abdominal drains one in the right hypochondriac and another in the epigastric
 regions are unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, mild pulmonary edema has improved, n
 mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and left lower lung atelectasis are
 worse.
