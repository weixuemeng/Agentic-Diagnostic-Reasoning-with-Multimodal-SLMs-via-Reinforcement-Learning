                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and chest congestion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is focal opacity in the left lower
 lung, most likely representing atelectasis and unlikely to represent
 infectious process.  If clinically warranted, followup of the patient four
 weeks after completion of antibiotics might be considered but again from the
 radiographical standpoint, the suspicion for pneumonia in the left lower lung
 is not substantial.
