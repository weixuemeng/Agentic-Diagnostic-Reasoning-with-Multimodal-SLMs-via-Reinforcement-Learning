                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pain with deep breathing, crackles heard on
 right lung base  // ? volume overload, effusion, atelectasis, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight asymmetric increased opacity in the right infrahilar region may reflect
 an early bronchopneumonia versus atelectasis.  Retrocardiac streaky opacities
 are probably atelectasis.  No edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant, suggesting
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight asymmetric increased opacity in the right infrahilar region could
 reflect an early bronchopneumonia versus atelectasis.
