                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 increase in severity and extent of the pre-existing, already severe bilateral
 parenchymal opacities.  The lung volumes appear to have decreased.  A number
 of visible air bronchograms is clearly increased.  Larger pleural effusions
 are not present.  The exact size of the cardiac silhouette can no longer be
 determined.  The course of the nasogastric tube and of the left PICC line
 constant.
