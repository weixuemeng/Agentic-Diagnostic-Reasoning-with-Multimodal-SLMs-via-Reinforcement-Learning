                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Multifocal
 alveolar opacities persist in both lungs, with overall slight improved
 aeration at both lung bases, but otherwise no relevant change.  Small left
 pleural effusion also appears slightly decreased compared to the recent
 radiograph.
