                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Painless jaundice, mild hypoxia, EKG changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:36.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is stable with unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  Since the prior study, there is new mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity also appears progressed, and could
 reflect an area of worsening atelectasis though infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm persists.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, new compared to the prior study, and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Worsening retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 increasing atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
