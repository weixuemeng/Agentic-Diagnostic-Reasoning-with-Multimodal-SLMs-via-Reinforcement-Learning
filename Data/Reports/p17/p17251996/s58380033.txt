 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube terminates within the distal stomach.  Cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Multifocal patchy opacities with a mid and lower lung predominance have
 worsened in the interval.  Although, possibly due to multifocal atelectasis,
 differential diagnosis includes an evolving infectious pneumonia and
 multifocal aspiration.  Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size,
 and small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
