                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post fall complaining of pain when breathing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low.  This accentuates the cardiac and mediastinal
 contours, with the heart size appearing borderline enlarged.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly
 identified.  Loss of height of a low thoracic vertebral body is of
 indeterminate age.  No displaced rib fractures are demonstrated, though the
 left lateral chest wall is not completely included in the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Markedly low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Limited assessment of the left lateral chest wall, though no grossly
 displaced rib fractures are seen.
 3. Mild compression deformity of a low thoracic vertebral body of
 indeterminate age, and clinical correlation is needed.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 1. Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort when
 the patient is able to better assess the lung bases.
 2. If there is concern for an acute thoracic spine compression deformity, CT
 of the thoracic spine is recommended.
 3. If there is high concern for rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib series
 if CT imaging of the thoracic spine is not pursued.
