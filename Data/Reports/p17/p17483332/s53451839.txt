                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs
 compatible with emphysematous changes. A subtle streaky opacity in the right
 lower lobe is identified potentially pneumonia.  The remainder of the lungs
 appear clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle is slightly increased
 suggestive of a very small right sided pleural effusion.   There is no
 pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Subtle right lower lobe streaky opacity for which an infectious process is
 possible versus atelectasis or airway inflammation.
 
 2. Hyperinflated lungs and probable emphysematous changes.
