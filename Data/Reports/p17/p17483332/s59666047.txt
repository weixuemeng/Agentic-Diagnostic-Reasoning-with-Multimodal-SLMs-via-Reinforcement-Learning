                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with body aches and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities in the lung bases and
 hyperexpansion are findings which correspond with stable underlying chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  A calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe
 is stable.  There is no new pulmonary nodule or mass.  No consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  Stable blunting of the posterior right costophrenic
 angle likely represents scarring.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underlying probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without
 acute process.
