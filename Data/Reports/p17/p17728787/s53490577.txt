                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epigastric abdominal pain and history of rectal cancer status post
 ostomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette size is unchanged, and
 borderline enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable otherwise.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Numerous clips are demonstrated within the left upper
 abdomen.
 
 No free air is identified under the diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.
