                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left shoulder pain, history of myocardial infarction and cardiac
 stent.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The heart size is likely mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but
 no overt pulmonary edema is present.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable mild cardiomegaly.
