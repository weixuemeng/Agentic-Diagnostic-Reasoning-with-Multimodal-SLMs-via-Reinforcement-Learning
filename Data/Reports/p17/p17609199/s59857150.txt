                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema, recent course of
 epidural steroids.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a faint opacifications in the left lower lobe that may
 represent pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  The heart size is top
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Otherwise, this most likely represents atelectasis.
