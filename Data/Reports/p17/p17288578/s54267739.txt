                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, intubation, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Initial radiographs show coiling of the tube in the pharynx and the
 tube tip projecting over the gastroesophageal junction.  Image 4, however,
 documents the tip of the tube in the middle parts of the stomach.  There is no
 documentation of the pharynx at that time point of the procedure.
 
 No evidence of complications.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette as
 well as mild bilateral areas of atelectasis are unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or other complications.
