                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is at least mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is
 identified.  Linear opacities in the lung bases are most compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with subsegmental atelectasis in the lung bases.
