                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subcutaneous gas, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with studies of ___, there is an extensive amount of
 gas in the supraclavicular regions bilaterally as well as pneumomediastinum as
 well as gas in the region of the neck close to the vertebral bodies.  There
 appears to be a right apical pneumothorax that is somewhat small.  There is a
 line suggesting pneumothorax at the base laterally, though there is suggestion
 of some vessels extending beyond this so that it may merely represent a skin
 fold.  There is some increased opacification at the level of the right
 cardiophrenic angle, which could reflect developing consolidation.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 7 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is above the
 esophagogastric junction.
 
 A repeat study with optimal technique would be helpful.
