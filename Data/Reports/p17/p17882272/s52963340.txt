                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough/fever, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a 2.6 cm linear metallic density only seen on the frontal view which
 projects over the expected site of the right pulmonary hilum. Possibility of
 foreign body is consider though this most likely represents external artifact
 and clinical correlation is advised. This finding is new from prior study
 dated ___.
 
 Lungs appear clear though volumes are low. The heart size is within normal
 limits.  The mediastinal contour is normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Linear metallic density projecting over the right pulmonary hilum, new
 from prior exam, likely external artifact, less likely foreign body.
 2.  Low lung volumes without definite sign of acute intrathoracic process.
