 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pleural effusion
 has substantially increased in extent and is now accompanied by substantial
 left lower lung atelectasis.  On the right, the effusion is unchanged and
 overall moderate.  Asymmetry of the mediastinum, caused by a known scoliosis. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Severe degenerative shoulder changes.  No
 evidence of new focal parenchymal opacities in the well-ventilated lung areas.
