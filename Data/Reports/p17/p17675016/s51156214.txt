 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Volume overload, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pre-existing
 pleural effusions have moderately increased in extent.  Also increased are the
 size of the cardiac silhouette and the areas of bilateral parenchymal
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  The right PICC line and the tracheostomy tube
 are in unchanged position.  In the well-ventilated lung areas, there is no
 evidence for the presence of new parenchymal opacities.
