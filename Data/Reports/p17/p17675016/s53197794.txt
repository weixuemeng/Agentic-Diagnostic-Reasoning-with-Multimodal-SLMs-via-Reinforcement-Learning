                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:56 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after tracheoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:48 p.m.:
 
 Mediastinum is wider than 12 hours earlier.  This could be due to vascular
 engorgement but raises concern for fluid accumulation.  Lung volumes are
 lower, with particularly worse atelectasis at the left base where there is
 also increase in moderate left pleural effusion.  I don't see an appreciable
 pneumothorax.  Right apical pleural drain and tracheostomy tube in standard
 placements, unchanged.  Findings, especially low lung volumes, mediastinal
 widening and possibility of volume overload were discussed by telephone with
 Dr. ___ at 9:15 a.m.
