                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with tracheobronchomalacia, intubated with positive
 pressure ventilation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there has been interval increase in
 pulmonary edema, particularly in the right lower lung, along with slight
 increase in size of moderate left and small right pleural effusions.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance.  The right internal
 jugular central venous catheter, and other support and monitoring devices are
 unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacification of the right lower lung, likely due to worsening
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Followup radiographs after diuresis are
 recommended to exclude pneumonia.
 
 2.  Slightly increased bilateral pleural effusions.
