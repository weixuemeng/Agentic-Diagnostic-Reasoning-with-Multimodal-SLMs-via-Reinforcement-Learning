                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheobronchoplasty, readmission, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion
 is constant, whereas the left pleural effusion has decreased in extent.  The
 effusions, however, are still clearly seen on the lateral image.  The lung
 parenchyma is more radiolucent than on the previous radiograph, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Scars at the level of the right hilus and
 moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persist.  No
 pulmonary edema.
