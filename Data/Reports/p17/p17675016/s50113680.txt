                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in place as well as a right PICC.  Stable
 appearance of cardiomediastinal contours allowing for positional differences
 between the studies.  Moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions are again
 demonstrated, with adjacent bilateral lower lobe opacities which most likely
 represent atelectasis.
