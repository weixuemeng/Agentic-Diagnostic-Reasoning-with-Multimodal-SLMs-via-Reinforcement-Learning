                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post right cannula placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with increased
 right pleural effusion with scars at the level of the lower right hilus
 previously identified.  The left lung appears clear, although there is
 increased left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  Secondary
 to overlying densities, it is difficult to appreciate exact placement of
 tracheal cannula.  There is no pneumothorax.  There has been interval removal
 of right central line.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Secondary to overlying densities, placement of tracheal cannula difficult to
 interpret.  Bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size.
