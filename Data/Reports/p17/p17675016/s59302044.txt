                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC ends in the superior cavoatrial junction.  An enteric
 tube ends off the inferior portion of this image.  Tracheostomy is in place. 
 There are low lung volumes.  There are persisient right greater than left
 small bilateral pleural effusions, at least mild cardiomegaly with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Visualization of the lower lobes is difficult and cannot
 rule out pneumonia in these areas.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  At least small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right,
 and moderate pulmonary edema consistent with fluid overload.  Cannot entirely
 rule out pneumonia in the lower lungs.
