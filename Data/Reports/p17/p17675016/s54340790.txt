                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the Dobbhoff
 tube extends to the distal esophagus, where it turns upon itself with the tip
 pointing upward and the tip at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  This
 information was immediately telephoned to the ICU.
