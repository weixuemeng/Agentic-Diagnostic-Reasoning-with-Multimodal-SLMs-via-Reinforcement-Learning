                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Repeated attempt at NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a
 supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___
 at 13:20.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of the Dobbhoff tube, previously coiled in the
 upper esophagus.  Interval placement of a new NGT, which turns towards the
 patient's left at the level of the diaphragm, somewhat higher than expected,
 and is presumed to end within the fluid-filled stomach.  The remainder of the
 lungs, mediastinum, and pleura are unchanged in appearance from the prior exam
 performed one hour earlier.
