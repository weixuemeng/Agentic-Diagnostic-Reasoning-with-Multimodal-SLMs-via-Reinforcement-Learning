                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with tracheomalacia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Tracheostomy is partially imaged as well
 as the Dobbhoff tube due the tilting of the patient's head.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted, but there is probable minimal improvement in vascular
 engorgement.  Right basal atelectasis is unchanged.
