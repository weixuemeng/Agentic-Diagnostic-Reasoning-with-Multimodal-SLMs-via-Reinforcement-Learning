                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions and tracheobronchomalacia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, as well as a
 right-sided PICC line, again terminating in the superior vena cava.  A pigtail
 catheter is partly visualized over the right hemithorax, although it may have
 been retracted somewhat noting that the pigtail appears partly uncoiled. 
 Persistent confluent left retrocardiac opacification.  The right costophrenic
 sulcus is partly excluded, but it appears that aeration is better at the
 visualized right lung base.  Severe degenerative changes involves the left
 glenohumeral joint. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suggestion of tension on a right pleural catheter; correlation
 with catheter condition is recommended.  Improving aeration of the right base,
 but persistent left retrocardiac opacification.
