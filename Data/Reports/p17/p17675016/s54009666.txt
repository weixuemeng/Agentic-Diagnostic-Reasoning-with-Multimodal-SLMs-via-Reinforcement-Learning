                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:10 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheobronchomalacia after
 tracheobronchoplasty, now undergoing diuresis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:11 p.m.:
 
 Pulmonary edema has improved substantially, if not cleared, in the right lung,
 and worsened in the left.  This could be positional.  Previous moderate right
 pleural effusion has largely resolved, pleural drainage tube still in place in
 the right lower hemithorax, with configuration that suggests the lumen may be
 compromised at several folds.  No pneumothorax.  Small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion may have increased.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal
 vascular engorgement unchanged.  Right PIC line ends in the region of the
 superior cavoatrial junction.  Short intratracheal excursion of the
 tracheostomy tube is now visible.
