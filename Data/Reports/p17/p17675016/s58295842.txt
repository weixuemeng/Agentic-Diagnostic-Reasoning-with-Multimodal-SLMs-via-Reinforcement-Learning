                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, evaluate pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:53.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 5:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in
 position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. 
 There are layering bilateral effusions with associated patchy bibasilar
 airspace process, likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although
 superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall, the
 perihilar vasculature appears somewhat prominent, but the pulmonary and
 interstitial edema has resolved.  No pneumothorax.
