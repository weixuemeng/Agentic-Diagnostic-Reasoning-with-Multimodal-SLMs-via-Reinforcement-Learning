 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New intubation, evaluation for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the patient now clearly
 carries an endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects approximately 6 cm
 above the carina, the tube could be slightly advanced.  The lung volumes have
 improved.  There is asymmetry of the mediastinal lines, caused by severe
 scoliosis.  Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions is
 unchanged, although the effusions distribute in a slightly different manner
 given changed patient position.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases are
 constant.  In the well-ventilated lung areas, there is no evidence for newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.
