 AP CHEST 6:05 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with hypercarbia.  Rule out effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and severe left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged. 
 The heart is enlarged and mediastinal veins dilated, probably indicating a
 volume overload.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Right
 pleural drain unchanged in the apex.  No appreciable pneumothorax.  The
 position of the tracheostomy tube with regard to the trachea is indeterminate
 because the airway is not clearly identified.
