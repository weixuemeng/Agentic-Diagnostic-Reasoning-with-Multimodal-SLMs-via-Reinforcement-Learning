                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:11 P.M.,  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion after chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:44 a.m.:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller following insertion of a right
 pleural drainage catheter, which is sharply folded, at least when seen in a
 single projection, and should be evaluated to make sure that it is freely
 opened.
 
 Moderate cardiac silhouette enlargement is probably unchanged, along with
 vascular congestion, mild edema and bibasilar atelectasis or pneumonia.  Some
 left pleural effusion is presumed, but not nearly as large as the right.  The
 internal portion of the tracheostomy tube is not visible, obscured by the
 mandible.  No pneumothorax.  A right upper posterior rib osteotomy node, and
 severe degeneration of the left shoulder noted.
