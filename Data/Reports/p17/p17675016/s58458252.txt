                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes which enhance the transverse diameter of the heart.  The degree of
 pleural effusion is probably slightly more than on the previous study, though
 it is difficult to compare the erect examination with the previous portable. 
 There is fluid within the minor fissure on both studies.  The left pleural
 effusion appears less prominent, but again this may merely reflect a change in
 patient position.  No definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
