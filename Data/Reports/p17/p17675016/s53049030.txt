                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate position of new tracheostomy tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  A Dobbhoff tube was placed, was
 malpositioned in the latest view, still is in the distal esophagus. 
 Increasing opacities in the right lung could be due to difference in
 positioning of the patient and different redistribution of pleural effusion,
 but increasing consolidation of the right upper lobe is suspected.  There is
 no pneumothorax. No other interval changes.
