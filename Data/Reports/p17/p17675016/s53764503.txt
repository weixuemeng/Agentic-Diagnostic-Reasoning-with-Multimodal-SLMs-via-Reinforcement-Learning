 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheobronchomalacia, pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, pre-existing moderate
 right pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent.  As a consequence,
 the transparency of the right lung, at its bases, is improved.  However, a new
 area of atelectasis has appeared on the left.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 The tracheostomy tube is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
