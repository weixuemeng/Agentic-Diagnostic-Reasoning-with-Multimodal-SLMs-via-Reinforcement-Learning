                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There appears to be a calcification in
 one of the valves in the heart, but this is difficult to evaluate and warrants
 further evaluation clinically and with echocardiography if clinically
 indicated.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  There
 is some possible pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  Probable
 calcification in  one of the cardiac valves, likely the aorta, warrants
 further evaluation clinically and with echocardiography if clinically
 indicated.
