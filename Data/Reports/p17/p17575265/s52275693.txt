                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Traumatic injury and reactive effusion on the left.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable.  Left pleural effusion
 appears to be unchanged since yesterday, moderate-to-large.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is redemonstrated.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mild vascular engorgement is noted.  Right
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
