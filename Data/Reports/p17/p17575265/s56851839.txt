                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a splenic laceration, kidney hematoma and
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous pulmonary edema has cleared, right lower lobe consolidation has
 improved, but left lower lobe consolidation is still very large, very dense,
 and accompanied by a moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  Of note, there has
 been little change in the radiographic findings since ___ when a
 concurrent chest CT showed no pericardial effusion, and left lower lobe
 collapse, attributable to the large minimally hemorrhagic left pleural
 effusion.
 
 No pneumothorax.
