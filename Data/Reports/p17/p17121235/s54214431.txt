                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax with hypoxia, assess for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Given supine technique assessment
 of pneumothorax is limited without evidence of large pneumothorax.  Small
 apical pneumothorax is likely still present.  Lungs are low in volume with
 resultant bronchovascular crowding and linear basilar atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite change in pneumothorax, although supine positioning limits
 assessment.
