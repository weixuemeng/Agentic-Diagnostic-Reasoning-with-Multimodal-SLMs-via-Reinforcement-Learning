                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is similar to the prior
 study allowing for differences in lung volumes, with apical visceral pleural
 line now below the right third posterior rib level.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion with apparent subpulmonic component also appears similar.  Patchy and
 linear atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region is slightly improved.  Left
 lung and pleural surfaces are otherwise clear.  Note is made of
 moderate-to-marked gastric distension in the imaged portion of the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax and moderate right
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Gastric distention.
