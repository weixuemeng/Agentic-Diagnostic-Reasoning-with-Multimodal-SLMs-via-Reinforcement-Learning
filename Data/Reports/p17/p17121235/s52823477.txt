                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax is unchanged.  There are persistent low lung volumes.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, largely on the right side are probably
 unchanged along the difference in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar
 atelectases, larger on the right side, have minimally increased.  Cardiomegaly
 is stable.
