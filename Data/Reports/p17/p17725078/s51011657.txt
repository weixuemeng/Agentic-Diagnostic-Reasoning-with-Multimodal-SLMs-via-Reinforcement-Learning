                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and COPD, who presents
 with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes have decreased in the interim, and there is
 interval increase in bilateral opacities projecting outward and upward from
 the hila.  There is an increased small left pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral perihilar pulmonary edema which given the
 normal heart size is likely noncardiogenic, possibly from volume overload in
 this patient with renal failure. The upper lobe predominance may reflect
 reverse Trendelenberg positioning or the patient's intrinsic pulmonary
 physiology.
