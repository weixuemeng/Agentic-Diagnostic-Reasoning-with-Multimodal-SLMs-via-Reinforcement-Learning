                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with shortness of breath, crackles, eval for intrapulmonary
 abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 The NG tube and right IJ has been removed.  A right PICC line terminates in
 the low SVC.  The left pleural effusion is slightly improved.  Bibasilar
 opacities are likely secondary to layering pleural effusions and atelectasis,
 though pneumonia is certainly possible.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities likely secondary to bilateral layering pleural
 effusions and atelectasis.  However, a supervening pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
