                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and hemoptysis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  The PA view is
 unremarkable.  Lateral view demonstrates questionable opacity posterior to the
 mid trachea that is not seen on the PA view.  Although finding may be a
 summation of shadows, given the patient's symptoms, further assessment is
 required with lateral oblique views.
