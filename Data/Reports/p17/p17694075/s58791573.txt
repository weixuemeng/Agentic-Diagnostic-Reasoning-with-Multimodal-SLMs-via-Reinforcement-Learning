                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with low O2 saturations.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips in the right axillary region are compatible with prior
 dissection.  Endotracheal tube tip sits between the clavicular heads.  Two
 endogastric tubes course inferiorly into the stomach and out of field of view.
 A right-sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip sits in the main pulmonary artery. 
 Left-sided IJ central venous catheter sits at the confluence of the left
 brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve
 as well as mediastinal clips appear unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are large but stable compared to prior study.  The lungs demonstrate bibasilar
 atelectasis as well as increasing pulmonary edema, moderate.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
