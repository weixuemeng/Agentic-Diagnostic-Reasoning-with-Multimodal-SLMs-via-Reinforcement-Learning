                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rising white blood count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  Low lung volumes again most likely account for the prominence
 of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Extensive scattered radiation
 obscures the image, though no definite vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia is identified.
