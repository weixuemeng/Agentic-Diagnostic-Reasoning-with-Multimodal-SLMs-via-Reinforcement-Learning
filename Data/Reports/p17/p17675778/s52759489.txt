                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with epigastric pain  // epigastric pain, blood, SOB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Heterogeneous radial opacity, smaller than 2 cm across projects
 over the anterior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are clear on the frontal view.  On the lateral view heterogeneous radio
 opacity, 2 cm across, in the middle lobe or lingula, projects over the
 anterior cardiac silhouette.  Its chronicity is indeterminate because there
 are no prior lateral chest radiographs.  It could be a scar,, but it could
 also be a small pulmonary infarct or in lung nodule.  When feasible, repeat
 radiographs should be obtained at full inspiration if the abnormality persists
 it should be evaluated with chest CT.
 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is top-normal in size.  Mediastinum and
 hilar contours are normal.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suggest further evaluation of possible left lung nodule, infarct, or scar.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional radiographs when feasible.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ (In Hospital,
 On Page), ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at
 08:50, one minutes after discovery of the findings.
