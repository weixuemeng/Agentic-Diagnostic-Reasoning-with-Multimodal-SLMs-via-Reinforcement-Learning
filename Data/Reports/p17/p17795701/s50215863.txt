                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right VATS, right lower lobe wedge
 resection.  Study requested to rule out pneumothorax after second chest tube
 placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval placement of a second right chest tube which terminates in the
 medial aspect of the right upper lung.  Prior chest tube is stable and in
 unchanged position.  There has been interval improvement of right basilar air
 collection. Residual right apical pneumothorax persists.  Lucency along the
 left upper lobe and absence of the first and second left ribs are consistent
 with prior surgical changes. There is associated volume loss and elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema over the
 right hemithorax and bilateral neck and supraclavicular regions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of second right chest tube with interval
 improvement of right basal pneumothorax and residual small right apical
 pneumothorax.
