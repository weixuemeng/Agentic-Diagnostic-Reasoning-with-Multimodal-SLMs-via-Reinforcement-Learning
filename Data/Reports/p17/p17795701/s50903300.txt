                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Recent chest tube placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Cardiac size is
 normal.  On the right, ___ apically oriented chest tube is in unchanged
 position since the prior study.  There is ___ extensive amount of subcutaneous
 emphysema, which is also similar in extent to the prior study.  There is now
 ___ extensive right hydropneumothorax several air-fluid levels are present in
 the inferior right hemithorax.  Interval increase in right base opacity is
 seen, could be from atelectasis and effusion, but underlying infection not
 excluded. Note is made of a prior left upper lobe resection; otherwise, the
 left lung is essentially clear aside from minimal basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right basilar hydropneumothorax with fluid
 components increasing since the prior study.  
 Interval increase in right base opacity is seen, could be from atelectasis and
 effusion, but underlying infection not excluded.Unchanged diffuse subcutaneous
 emphysema and apically oriented right-sided chest tube.
