                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen are 2 right chest tubes with tips in the right apex.  there is
 increased lucency at the right apex which may represent a small right
 pneumothorax, althought the lung margin is difficult to visualize.  Chain
 sutures are again seen projecting over the right upper lung. there is a right
 effusion extending laterally.  there are volume loss and compressive changes
 and scarring in both bases.  there  continues to be a large amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema on the right. lucency within the right major fissure
 suggests loculated pneumothorax in that region.
