 Right chest tube has been pulled back, now the tip projects at the level of
 the third anterior rib which before was projecting at the level of the
 anterior right first rib.  There is no pneumothorax.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  A small
 right effusion has minimally decreased.  Vascular congestion has resolved. 
 There are no new lung abnormalities.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has
 improved.  Sternal wires are unchanged.  Multiple surgical chains are again
 noted in the left medial hemithorax.
