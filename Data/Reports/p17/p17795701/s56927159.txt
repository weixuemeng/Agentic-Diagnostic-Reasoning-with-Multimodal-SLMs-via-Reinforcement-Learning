                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Upper lobe wedge resection and decortication.  Now with
 pull-back of chest tube, assess for change.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Right apical chest tube now projects at the level of the posterior fourth
 right rib.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  A small right pleural effusion
 has decreased.  Mild pulmonary edema has almost resolved.  Bibasilar
 atelectases, larger on the right, have markedly improved.  Cardiac size is
 normal.  Mediastinum is not widened.  Multiple surgical clips project in the
 left apex medially.  Sternal wires are in unchanged position.  Right PICC can
 be followed to the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins, but not in the
 SVC, has been pulled back from prior study.  There are no other changes.
