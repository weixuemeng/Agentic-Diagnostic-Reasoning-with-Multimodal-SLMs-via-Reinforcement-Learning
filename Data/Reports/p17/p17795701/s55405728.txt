                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of left upper lobectomy for lung
 carcinoma, now recently status post right apical wedge resection secondary to
 concerning ___-mm pulmonary nodule.  Patient with right chest tube in place. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph from ___ and numerous
 chest CTs dating back to ___, most recent from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Right-sided chest tube is in place with
 the tip in the right upper hemithorax.  However, there is a large pneumothorax
 with significant collapse of the underlying right lung.  The patient has
 chronic leftward mediastinal shift secondary to volume loss from left upper
 lobectomy, however, there appears to be slightly increased leftward shift on
 the current examination as compared to the preoperative, raising concern for
 tension.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the right chest wall.  There is
 increased opacity within the left lung base, likely secondary to layering
 pleural effusion and some atelectasis.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New large right pneumothorax with significant right lung collapse
 and worsening leftward mediastinal shift.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above urgent results to Dr. ___
 ___ at 11:20 a.m. on ___, immediately after discovery.
