 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tubes remain in place, with persistent
 moderate-to-large right pneumothorax with apical pneumothorax component and
 basilar hydropneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Note is made of previous left upper lobe and partial chest wall
 resection as well as more recent right upper lung wedge resection.  Improving
 multifocal atelectasis in the right lung and in the left mid lung area.  No
 new or worsening lung opacities.  Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is again
 demonstrated in the right chest wall and both supraclavicular regions
 extending into the superior mediastinum.
