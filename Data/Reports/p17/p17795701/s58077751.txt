                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known right pneumothorax, now with chest
 tube to suction.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 10:54 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right apical chest tube has been placed
 to suction in the interval.  Near resolution of a previously seen large right
 pneumothorax is noted.  Minimal residual pleural air is seen laterally on the
 right.  There is moderate pulmonary edema in the right lung which may be
 related to re-expansion.  Small bibasilar effusions and atelectasis are
 likely.  Chronic volume loss of the left lung secondary to left upper
 lobectomy is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain mildly
 enlarged, though unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of prior large right pneumothorax with
 chest tube to suction.  Moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema with probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
