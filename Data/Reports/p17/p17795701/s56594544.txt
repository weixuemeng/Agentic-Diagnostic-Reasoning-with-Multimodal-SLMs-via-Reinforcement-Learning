                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  One of two right-sided chest tubes have been removed, with no
 visible pneumothorax.  Post-operative changes in right upper lobe are
 consistent with recent wedge resection procedure, and note is made of more
 remote left upper lobe resection with partial chest wall resection. 
 Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung show interval improvement, and a
 small partially loculated right pleural effusion has also slightly decreased
 in the interval.  Multifocal linear areas of scar versus atelectasis in the
 left lung appear similar.  Subcutaneous emphysema persists in the chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax following removal of one of two
 right-sided chest tubes.
