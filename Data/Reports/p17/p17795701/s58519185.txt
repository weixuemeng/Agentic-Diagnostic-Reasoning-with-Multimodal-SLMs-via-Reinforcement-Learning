 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.

 resulted in significant improvement of the apical component of the right

 remain low with atelectasis of the left lung base. Increased opacity at right
 lung base persists and could be due to atelectasis and effusion.  Substantial
