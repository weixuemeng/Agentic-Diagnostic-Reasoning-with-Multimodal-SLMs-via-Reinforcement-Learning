                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.  There are low lung
 volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Relative right base opacity most likely
 relates to atelectasis, although early consolidation from infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting and could
 consider repeat PA and lateral views with deeper inspiration when patient
 able.  Bilateral diaphragmatic and pleural plaques seen to suggest prior
 asbestos exposure.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Hilar contours may be
 accentuated by AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Increased right base opacity without priors for
 comparison, infectious process or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Consider
 repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs with deeper inspiration when patient
 able.  Bilateral calcified pleural/diaphragmatic plaques suggest prior
 asbestos exposure.
