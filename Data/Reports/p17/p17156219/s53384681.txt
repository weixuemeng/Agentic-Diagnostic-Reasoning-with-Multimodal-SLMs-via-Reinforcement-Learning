 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:45 PM
  New haziness at the right lung base may reflect a small layering effusion. No
  other significant change from the most recent prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVR  // eval for hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___ at 12:47.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is in stable position, terminating 6 cm above the carina. There is
 stable position of right chest pacer device with associated dual leads
 projecting in unchanged position approximately over the right atrium and right
 ventricle. Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are
 again seen. Left chest tube is in stable position. Enteric tube again seen in
 stable position with tip projecting of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 known large hiatal hernia. There is a PA catheter are in stable position.
 
 There is leftward rotation on the current radiograph. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph, there is increased opacification at the
 right lung base and indistinctness of the right lateral CP angle, consistent
 with new small right layering pleural effusion. There is no left effusion.
 There is continued retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with ongoing left lower lobe volume loss, possibly
 atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable lines and tubes.  New small right layering pleural effusion, may
 represent small hemothorax.  Otherwise no significant interval changes.
