                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AVR, follow up edema and right pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires present. There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular plethora, without other evidence of
 CHF.  There are small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A right-sided pacemaker is present, lead tips over right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are noted. A small right pneumothorax is unchanged compared
 with ___ at 11:24 a.m.
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:24 a.m. and allowing for differences in
 positioning, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly, status post sternotomy with pacemaker.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution and very slight vascular plethora, without overt
 CHF.
 
 4.  Bilateral small effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 
 5.  Small right pneumothorax again seen, unchanged.
