                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube extends to the upper body of the stomach.  The
 side hole is close to the level of the esophagogastric junction, so that the
 tube should be pushed forward about 5 cm or more to decrease the likelihood of
 aspiration.
