                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post OGT placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 3 cm above
 the carina.  An OG-type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off
 film.  
 
 There is probable background COPD. Prominent tapered configuration of the
 pulmonary hila raises the question of background pulmonary hypertension. There
 is cardiomegaly and mild upper zone redistribution.  No overt CHF or frank
 consolidation.  Possible slight blunting of both costophrenic angles, without
 gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  OG tube extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 2.  COPD, cardiomegaly, ?pulmonary hypertension, and mild upper zone
 redistribution.
