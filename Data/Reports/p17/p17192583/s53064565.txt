                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Rounded densities at
 the left base and right hilum may be projectional, but focal bronchal dilation
 or, less likely, large AVMs can be considered. Linear bibasilar densities are
 most compatible with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Round left basilar and right
 hilar densities warrant further evaluation with oblique views to exclude true
 masses.
