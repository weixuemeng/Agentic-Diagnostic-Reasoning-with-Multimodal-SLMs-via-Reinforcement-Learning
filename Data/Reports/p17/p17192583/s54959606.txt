                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Patchy left basilar opacification has decreased.
 There is no pneumothorax.  There is a patchy non-specific right infrahilar
 density, as mentioned previously, not significantly changed.  Patchy right
 infrahilar density appears unchanged.  Based on effacement of the posterior
 left costophrenic sulcus, there is potentially a very small pleural effusion. 
 The lungs appear hyperinflated.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving left basilar opacity.  Possible trace left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Persistent appearance of patchy nodular right infrahilar
 opacity; in follow-up, evaluation with bilateral oblique views versus chest CT
 is recommended, as discussed previously.
