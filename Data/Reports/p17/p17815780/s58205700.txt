                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, preoperative assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular approach central venous dialysis catheter
 is present with tip terminating in the low SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are present, small to moderate on the right and small on the left, with
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the right lung base may be
 accounted for by the pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, but an
 underlying consolidation is not excluded; the right hemidiaphram also appears
 elevated.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is moderate cardiomegaly, and the
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Volume overload, as evidenced by bilateral pleural effusions and
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Underlying consolidation at the right lung base is
 not excluded, but findings could possibly be explained as atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.
