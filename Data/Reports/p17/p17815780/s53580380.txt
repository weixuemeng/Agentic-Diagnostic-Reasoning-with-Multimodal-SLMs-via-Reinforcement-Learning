                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by improving pulmonary edema and
 persistent moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity probably represents
 atelectasis, although aspiration is an additional consideration in the
 appropriate setting.
