                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  This examination is limited secondary to
 significant soft tissue attenuation and arms-down technique on the lateral
 view.  Lung volumes are extremely low obscuring the lower lobes.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature appears engorged,
 but there is no overt interstitial edema.  No definite pleural effusion is
 identified.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits on this AP chest
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes limiting evaluation.  Likely bibasilar
 atelectasis with some mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Dedicated PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended when patient is clinically able for
 further assessment.
