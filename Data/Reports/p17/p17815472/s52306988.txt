                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness, elevated lactate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is mild right basal
 atelectasis likely accounting for the subtle retrocardiac opacity on the
 lateral projection.  Otherwise, no convincing signs of pneumonia, edema.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  Subtle prominence of the right hilum may reflect bronchovascular
 crowding.  Imaged bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild right basal atelectasis.
