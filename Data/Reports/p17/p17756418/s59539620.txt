                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest.  Since the
 next most recent study, there has been slight improvement in bibasilar
 opacities.  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus likely
 represents small pleural effusion and atalectasis.  Persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis; however, pneumonia is not
 excluded.  There is also likely a small right pleural effusion.  No other
 focal airspace opacity is detected.  The heart is not enlarged. The aorta is
 calcified and somewhat tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis; however, infection is
 not excluded.
