                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  White blood cell count rising to ___.2.  Evaluate for developing
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued low lung
 volumes with linear atelectasis at the left base, which appears mildly
 improved since the prior radiograph.  The right basilar opacity appears
 slightly more confluent, possibly indicating developing pneumonia.  Otherwise,
 there is no area of focal consolidation.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours
 are unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increasing right basilr opacity, which could potentially
 represent a developing pneumonia. Short term follow up radiographs may be
 helpful.
