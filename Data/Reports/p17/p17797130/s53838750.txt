                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Pulmonary vascularity is is normal.  4 mm nodular density in the right mid
 lung field likely reflects a calcified granuloma.  Streaky retrocardiac
 opacity could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded. 
 Linear opacities in the right lung base likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.
