                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there are bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
 atelectasis at the bases and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
