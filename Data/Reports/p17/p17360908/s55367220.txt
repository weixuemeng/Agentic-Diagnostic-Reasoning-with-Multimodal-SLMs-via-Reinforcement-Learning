                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed, now intubated, check position.
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube lies 19 mm from the carinal angle and should
 be withdrawn to a better position.
 
 The nasogastric tube tip lies below the diaphragm, but the side hole lies
 within the lower esophagus.  This should be advanced.
 
 The lung fields are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube too low.  Nasogastric tube too high. Team
 informed.
