                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dementia and recent fall.  Now with cough,
 question pneumonia.  Please note patient was unable to raise her hands making
 the lateral film 
 nondiagnostic.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is largely
 stable from the prior study.  There is a slight prominence of the vasculature
 but no focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.  Opacities at the left
 lung base could be due to overlying soft tissue versus a small effusion.  The
 right lung appears clear.  Cardiac size is top normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes and elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Possible very small left
 pleural effusion versus soft tissue attenuation at the left base.  No evidence
 of pneumonia.
