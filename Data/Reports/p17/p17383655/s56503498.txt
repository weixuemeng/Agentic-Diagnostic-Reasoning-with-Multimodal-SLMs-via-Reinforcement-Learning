                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain status post upper endoscopy, here to evaluate for
 evidence of esophageal perforation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 evidence of pneumomediastinum.  No free air is seen beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm. A loosely coiled density projecting over the right neck on the
 frontal view is likely external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Loosely coiled density projecting over the right neck on the frontal view
 is likely external to the patient.
