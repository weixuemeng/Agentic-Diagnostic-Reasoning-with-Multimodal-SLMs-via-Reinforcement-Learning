                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with femoral fracture  // NG tube placement    
 NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparisons in ___ ___ at 16 32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 21:57
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. There has
 been interval placement of a feeding tube which courses below the diaphragm
 with the tip projecting over the stomach. There is a layering left effusion
 and likely a smaller right effusion with patchy bibasilar opacities most
 likely reflect ing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded. There has been interval development of more confluent opacities in
 the left mid lung adjacent to the infrahilar region as well as in the right
 upper lobe.  In addition, the vasculature appears indistinct. Although these
 findings may all reflect pulmonary edema, superimposed pneumonia or aspiration
 should also be considered.  No pneumothorax.  Clips in the right upper
 quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  The heart remains
 enlarged. Prominent superior mediastinal soft tissues likely reflect prominent
 vasculature accentuated due to differences in positioning.
