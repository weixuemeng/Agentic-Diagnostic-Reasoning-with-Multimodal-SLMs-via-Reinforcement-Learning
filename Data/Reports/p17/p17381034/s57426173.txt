                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Mechanical fall down ___ steps with bilateral rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No fracture is seen, however,
 if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, consider rib series, which is
 more sensitive.
