                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of desaturation and hypotension.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the knob.  There is an enteric tube
 which courses below the diaphragm with the tip within the stomach; however,
 with the side port immediately below the gastroesophageal junction.  Bibasilar
 opacities, more pronounced within the left lung base are noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in the left lung base, could
 reflect pneumonia or aspiration.
 2.  Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the site port immediately
 distal to the GE junction and should be slightly advanced.
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at
 ___:___ ___m. on the day of the exam.
