                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Exertional dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, with mild calcification of the aortic arch.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is improved compared to the prior study.  Minimal patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted, not significantly changed from the prior exam.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  Deformity of the
 sternum on the lateral view suggests an old healed fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, improved compared to the prior study with patchy
 bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
