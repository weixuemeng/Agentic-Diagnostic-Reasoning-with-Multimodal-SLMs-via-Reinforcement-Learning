                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, lung disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Increased interstitial opacities within the lung bases are compatible with
 known varicoid and cystic bronchiectasis, better demonstrated on the previous
 CT, with the remainder of the lungs appearing clear.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation are seen.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pneumothorax.  Right-sided chest wall deformity is re-
 demonstrated, and partially imaged is cervical spinal fusion hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cystic and varicoid bronchiectasis within the lung bases, with no new opacity
 identified to indicate pneumonia.
