 ADDENDUM  There was a transcription error in the previous study. The
 interpretation should read as follows:
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly
 better inspiration but otherwise there is little change. The cardiac
 silhouette remains within normal limits and there is mild tortuosity of the
 descending aorta. Apical pleural changes are again noted. No evidence of acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
