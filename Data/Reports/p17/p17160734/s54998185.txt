 INDICATION:  Patient status post motor vehicle accident.  Assess for rib
 injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung
 volumes without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Hilar
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  No osseous injury is detected.
