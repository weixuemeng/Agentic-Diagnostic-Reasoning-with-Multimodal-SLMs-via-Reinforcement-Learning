                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver transplant on immunosuppression
 with fevers and cough, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 15:03.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 14:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is slight persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and possible
 tiny right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  A catheter overlies
 the right upper quadrant in this patient status post liver transplant.  A
 linear opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflects scarring or
 subsegmental atelectasis.  The lungs are relatively well inflated without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  Several wedge compression fractures in the lower thoracic spine,
 one of which has undergone vertebroplasty.  No acute bony abnormality is
 appreciated.
