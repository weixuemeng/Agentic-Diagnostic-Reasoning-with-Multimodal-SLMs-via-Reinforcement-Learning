                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Liver transplant and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The right upper
 extremity PICC line is again seen with its tip poorly visualized, though
 extending into the low SVC.  The lung volumes are low.  A linear density in
 the right lower lung is again seen, likely scarring or atelectasis.  No
 definite consolidation, allowing for the low lung volumes.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony
 structures remain intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study given low lung volumes without convincing signs of
 pneumonia.
