                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff tube is coiled in the lower-to-mid body of the
 stomach.  Nasogastric tube is somewhat difficult to follow, but appears to
 extend to the distal stomach and then coil back on itself so that the tip lies
 in the upper body of the stomach.
