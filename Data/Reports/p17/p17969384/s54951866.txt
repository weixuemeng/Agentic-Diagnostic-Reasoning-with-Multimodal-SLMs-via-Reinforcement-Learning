                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may relate
 to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The
 right lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Partially imaged is surgical metallic fusion
 hardware at the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity, most
 likely represents atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
