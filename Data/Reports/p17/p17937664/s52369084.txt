                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with fever and confusion.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior exam.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 elevated secondary to gaseous distension of bowel, incompletely visualized. 
 No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is mild.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are intact and unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence of pneumonia. Lower lung volumes, perhaps in the
 setting of stomach distension.
