 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 05:43
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with non-small cell lung cancer, admitted
 for stridor, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___, at 12:13
 as well as selected images from a CT of the chest dated ___ at 09:58.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 05:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with an associated right upper
 lobe opacity are known to represent the patient's lung carcinoma.  No focal
 airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.  The left lung is
 hyperinflated consistent with known underlying emphysema.  Heart remains
 somewhat prominent with a left ventricular configuration suggestive of left
 ventricular hypertrophy.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Scattered degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no acute bony
 abnormality appreciated.
