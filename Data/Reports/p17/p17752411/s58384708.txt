                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer, now with
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Right suprahilar and right upper lobe
 nodules are again seen.  Bibasilar and perihilar fullness most likely
 represents atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this single view.  Heart size is
 normal.  Aortic tortuosity is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, slightly limiting evaluation, with no
 radiographic evidence for acute process on this single view.  Lung nodules as
 seen previously.
