                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with PICC and arm redness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. Heart size is normal. The aorta
 remains tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The lungs remain hyperinflated
 suggestive of COPD. Minimal scarring with pleural thickening is demonstrated
 within the right costophrenic angle. Slightly increased interstitial opacities
 in the lung bases as well as a vague opacity in the left lung base remain
 relatively unchanged, likely reflective of the sequela of chronic aspiration
 and bronchiectasis. There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the appearance of the chest from prior. 
 PICC tip in the mid SVC.
