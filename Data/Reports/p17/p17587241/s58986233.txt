                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 ADDENDUM:  Subsequent to the initial review of this study, chest radiographs
 performed ___ was provided for side by side comparison.  They
 showed generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality, coalescing in the right
 base, and small right pleural effusion.  Although pneumonia is a possible
 diagnosis, particularly viral infection, I think this was largely, if not
 entirely, pulmonary edema, nearly all of which cleared between ___ and
 ___.  The residual abnormality at the right lung base is the area of
 most severe previous involvement, and could have been pneumonia.  Distortion
 and attenuation of pulmonary vasculature generally indicates emphysema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of right-sided pneumonia at
 outside hospital, here to evaluate for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  The prior outside study is not available for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a hazy opacity in the right lung base corresponding to the
 right lower lobe on the lateral view, which may represent residual or
 resolving infection, but prior studies are not available for comparison. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Incidental
 note is made of pectus deformity with superior pectus carinatum and inferior
 pectus excavatum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Faint right lower lobe opacity may represent residual or resolving
 infection; however, prior studies are not available for comparison.
 2.  Small right and trace left pleural effusions.
