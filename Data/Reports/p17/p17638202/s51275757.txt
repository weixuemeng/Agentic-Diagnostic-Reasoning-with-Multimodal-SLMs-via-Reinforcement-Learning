                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, hypoxia, altered mental status, STEMI, now
 septic shock, question aspiration pneumonia or line placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:08 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies at the level of lower clavicular heads
 approximately 6.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, extending
 beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  
 
 A right IJ central line tip is present, tip overlying the right atrium --
 clinical correlation regarding retraction by approximately 3.3 cm is
 requested.  
 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bibasilar atelectasis are
 both unchanged.  There is upper zone re-distribution and minimal vascular
 plethora, without other evidence of CHF -- this may be slightly worse than on
 the prior film.  Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD.
