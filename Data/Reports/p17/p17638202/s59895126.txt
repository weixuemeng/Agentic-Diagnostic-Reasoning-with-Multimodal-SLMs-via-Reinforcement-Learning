                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Abnormal chest x-ray ___ years ago, raising possibility of a lung
 nodule or tracheal abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Hyperinflation and the sagittal elongation of the trachea suggests chronic
 obstructive lung disease, particularly emphysema.  There is no focal pulmonary
 abnormality, specifically the previously questioned right upper lung lesion
 projecting over the second anterior interspace.  The elliptical opacity
 projecting over the mid thoracic spine is in exactly the same location today
 despite some difference in patient positioning, confirming that this is almost
 certainly a spinal osteophyte, and needs no further evaluation.  There is no
 focal pulmonary abnormality, pleural effusion, or evidence of central
 adenopathy and the heart is normal size.
