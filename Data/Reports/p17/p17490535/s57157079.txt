                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall, with chest pain.  Evaluate
 for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for some vascular
 crowding.  No focal opacities are present.  Posterior mediastinal widening is
 not acute and likely due to a tortuous dilated thoracic aorta. Stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Of note, chest
 radiographs are not tailored for the assessment of bony structures. If
 clinical concern for osseous trauma is high, dedicated detailed views are
 recommended.
