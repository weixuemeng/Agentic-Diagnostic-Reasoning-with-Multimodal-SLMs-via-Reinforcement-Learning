                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Epilepsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A neural stimulator device projects over the left chest.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lateral view depicts a possible nodular opacity, which is
 newly apparent over posterior costophrenic sulci, possibly a summation shadow
 of normal vascular structures.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Possible posterior basilar
 nodule versus summation artifact.
 
 When clinically appropriate follow-up chest CT is recommended.
