                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Heart failure, pleural effusion, lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pectoral
 Port-A-Cath has been removed.  A parenchymal scar is seen projecting over the
 lung apex.  Perpendicular to this scar, a line of surgical ___ is seen, so
 that the lesion is likely reflecting a post-operative change.  Surgical clips
 are also projecting over the aortopulmonary window.  There is extensive
 valvular calcification.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.  No lung nodules or masses.  However, there is an asymmetric area
 of left apical thickening that is, however, unchanged as compared to the
 previous image.
