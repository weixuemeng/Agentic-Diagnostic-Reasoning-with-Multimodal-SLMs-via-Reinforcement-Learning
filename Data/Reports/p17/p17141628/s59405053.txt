                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cirrhosis and encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the interstitium and pulmonary vascular markings.  The
 azygos vein is dilated.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  No
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Dilated azygous vein indicates increased pulmonary vascular pressure.  Most of
 the interstitial markings on this exam, however, are more attributable to low
 lung volumes.
