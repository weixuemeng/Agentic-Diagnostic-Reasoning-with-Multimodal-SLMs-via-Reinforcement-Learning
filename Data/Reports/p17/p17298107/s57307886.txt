 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic stenosis, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  One single image is provided.  The lung volumes are low.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No overt pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumonia.  The limiting factor is that the lung bases and the left
 costophrenic sinus are not included on the current image.
