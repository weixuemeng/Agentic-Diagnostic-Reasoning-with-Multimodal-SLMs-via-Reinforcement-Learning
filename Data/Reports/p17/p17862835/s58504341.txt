                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent hyperglycemia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated.  Linear opacification is again seen at the left lung base
 which likely reflects scarring as demonstrated on the prior CT.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Linear opacification of the retrocardiac space is likely
 scarring/atelectasis and is unchanged.
