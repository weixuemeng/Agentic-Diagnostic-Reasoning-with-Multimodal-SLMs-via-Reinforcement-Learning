                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Linear opacities in the bilateral lower lobes likely represents subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Calcification along the expected
 region 1 of the left lower thoracic anterior ribs likely represents a chronic
 rib deformity. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Clip is
 noted overlying the right upper quadrant.Vascular stent projects over the
 expected region of the left axillary vein or artery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Linear opacities in the left greater than right lower lobes likely
 represent subsegmental atelectasis.
 2.  No focal consolidation or definite evidence of pneumonia.
