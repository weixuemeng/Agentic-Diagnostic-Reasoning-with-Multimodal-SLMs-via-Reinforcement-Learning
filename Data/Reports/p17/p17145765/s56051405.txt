                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with three months of cough, evaluate
 for infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  A permanent pacer is identified in left
 anterior axillary position and seen to be connected to an intracavitary IC
 device seen to terminate with the electrode in the periphery of the right
 ventricular cavity.  The position of the device is completely unchanged in
 both frontal and lateral views in comparison with the followup examination at
 the time of installation.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal
 variation demonstrating a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour,
 a finding which in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta suggests systemic hypertension.  The pulmonary circulation,
 however, is not congested and there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary
 infiltrate.  Pleural sinuses are free laterally and posteriorly, and no
 pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  Mild degree of degenerative changes
 is seen in the thoracic spine without evidence of any vertebral body
 compression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient with ICD device, no evidence of pulmonary congestion or
 acute infiltrate that could explain the patient's history of three months of
 cough.
