                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Gait instability and ptosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  Questionable more
 conspicuous nodular opacity adjacent to the left heart border is demonstrated
 and unclear if represents summation of shadows,   or true nodule.  Apical
 scarring is re-demonstrated, unchanged.  No additional lesions, masses or
 consolidations demonstrated.
 
 No pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity adjacent to the left cardiac border that might represent summation
 of shadows, infection or a neoplasm.  Given its absence on the prior study,
 re-assessment with chest CT might be considered.  
 
 Apical scarring, unchanged.
 
 Bronchiectasis, in particular in right middle lobe and lingula, unchanged
 since the prior study.
