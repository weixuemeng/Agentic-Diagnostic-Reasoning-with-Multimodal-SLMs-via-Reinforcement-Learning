                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible subclavian artery perforation, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 little change.  No evidence of pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. 
 Obliquity of the patient towards the right is probably responsible for the
 relative prominence of soft tissues in the superior mediastinum.
 
 Otherwise, no interval change.
