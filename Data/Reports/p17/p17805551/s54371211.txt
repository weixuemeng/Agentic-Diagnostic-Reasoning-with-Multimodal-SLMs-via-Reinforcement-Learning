                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with one week of productive cough.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are low, exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular markings.  Streaky
 opacities in the left lower lung suggest minor atelectasis.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is slight
 calcification of the aortic knob.  Osseous structures are unremarkable. No
 radiopaque foreign bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease; streaky
 left lower lung opacity is minimal and suggestive of slight atelectasis.  Low
 lung volumes.
