                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with calcification
 depicted along the arch.  The medial right lung apex shows substantial pleural
 thickening and vague adjacent parenchymal density.  Otherwise the lungs appear
 clear.  There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric medial right apical opacification.  This may be due to scarring but
 malignancy is not excluded and should be considered.  If prior radiographs are
 not available to show along long-term stability of this appearance then chest
 CT should be performed to assess further when clinically appropriate.
