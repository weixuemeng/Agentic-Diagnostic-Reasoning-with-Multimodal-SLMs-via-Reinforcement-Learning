                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, secondary syphilis, ?MTB. Looking at
 interval change  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.  The projection
 limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour however the hila to appears
 prominent and there is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely
 reflecting a degree of congestive heart failure.  In this setting, the
 presence of perihilar airspace opacity particularly in the right lung likely
 reflect pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.  There is prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature and predominantly perihilar airspace opacities most
 consistent with pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded.
