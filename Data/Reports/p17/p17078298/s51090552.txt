                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, evaluate for rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases, more pronounced on the left, likely reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is visualized.  No displaced fracture is clearly evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and probable trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 If there is continued concern for a rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib
 series.
