                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest wall tenderness after fall.  Evaluate
 for fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture,
 within the technical limitations of this radiograph.  Gas collection
 projecting over the soft tissue of the right lower chest could be trapped
 externally in skin folds, but is readily examined for crepitus.  If there are
 focal physical findings pointing to chest wall trauma, detail views of the
 area should be requested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No displaced rib fracture or evidence of visceral injury.  Suggest palpation
 of right ___ and 6th ribs laterally for possible subcutaneous emphysema. ___
 ___ and ___ were paged.
