  Low lung volumes.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm with gaseous distention of
  bowel beneath.
  
  Subtle posterior basilar opacities seen on the lateral view may be due to
  atelectasis but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
  setting.
  
  Prominent superior mediastinum may relate to low lung volumes however there is
  small concern for acute mediastinal process, consider chest CTA.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, abnormal EKG  // evaluate for
 cardiomegaly, ACS, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated with gaseous distension of bowel beneath.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  Subtle posterior basilar opacity seen on the
 lateral view may represent atelectasis but consolidation is not excluded the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinum appears somewhat prominent, which may relate to low lung volumes. 
 If clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, consider chest CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm with gaseous distention of
 bowel beneath.
 
 Subtle posterior basilar opacities seen on the lateral view may be due to
 atelectasis but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 Prominent superior mediastinum may relate to low lung volumes however there is
 small concern for acute mediastinal process, consider chest CTA.
