                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation and pleural effusion, questionable chronic heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion, better visible on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph, has moderately increased in extent.  The lateral radiograph of
 today's examination shows a newly appeared left pleural effusion.  As a
 consequence, bilateral basal areas of atelectasis have newly developed. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of pneumonia.
