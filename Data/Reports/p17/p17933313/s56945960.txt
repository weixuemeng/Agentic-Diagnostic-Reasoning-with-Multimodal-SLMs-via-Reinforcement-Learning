                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large, partially loculated right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  There is slight blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle and a trace left pleural effusion may be
 present.  The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 accurately assess due to the right side opacity.  The aorta appears somewhat
 tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large right pleural effusion, possibly partially loculated, and with fluid
 seen tracking in the minor fissure, with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.
 
 Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural
 effusion.  Left base atelectasis.
