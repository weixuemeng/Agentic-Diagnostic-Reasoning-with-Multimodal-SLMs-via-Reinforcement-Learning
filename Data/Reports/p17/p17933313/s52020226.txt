                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lymphoma, abdominal distension and aortic stenosis.  Assess for
 CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung base is poorly assessed due to obscuration by
 atelectasis and effusion. Small bilateral pleural effusions are as on the
 prior study.  The heart is top normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. Apparent enlargment of the left hilus as on the prior study is
 likely due to a grouping of left pulmonary veins.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
 Incompletely assessed right lung base can be further evaluated by CT if of
 clinical concern.
