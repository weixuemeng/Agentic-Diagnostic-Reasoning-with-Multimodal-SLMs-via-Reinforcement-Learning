                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Right base
 opacity is similar to possibly minimally improved as compared to the prior
 study, given differences in inspiration, likely representing a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace pleural effusion.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable-to-possibly mildly improved right base opacity which may
 represent a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Small left
 pleural effusion.
