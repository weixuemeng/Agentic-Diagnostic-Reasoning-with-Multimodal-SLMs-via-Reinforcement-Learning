                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There has been interval resolution of the previously
 seen left-sided pleural effusion.  Small right-sided pleural effusion
 persists.  Somewhat linear left basilar opacity, new from prior, may be due to
 atelectasis; however, possibility of infection is not excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Calcified mediastinal
 nodes are identified on the right.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of previously seen left-sided pleural effusion.  Left
 basilar likely atelectasis noting that early pneumonia cannot entirely be
 excluded.
