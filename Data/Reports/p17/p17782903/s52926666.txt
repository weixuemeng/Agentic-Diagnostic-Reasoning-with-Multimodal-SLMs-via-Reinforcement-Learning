                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently described left lower lobe opacity corresponds to a
 combination of linear parenchymal scarring and a partially calcified pleural
 abnormality on recent CT abdomen of ___.  This appears similar to the
 previous chest radiograph.  On the right, note is made of a localized
 extrapleural lipoma in the periphery of the right mid lung region, which has
 also been characterized on the CT abdomen study.  Lungs and pleural surfaces
 are otherwise clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacity in left lower hemithorax, which corresponds to
 linear parenchymal scarring and a partially calcified pleural abnormality on
 CT abdomen of ___.  These findings are most likely the sequela of
 previous hemothorax or empyema, but followup CT could be obtained in six
 months from the prior CT scan to ensure stability and to exclude an active
 process in this region.
