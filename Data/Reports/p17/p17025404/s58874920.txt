                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube (x2) removal  // pls eval interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of 2 right-sided chest tubes.   Again seen is
 a small right apical pneumothorax, minimally larger compared with the prior
 film.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base and minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, without gross effusion.  Small amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right and upper left lungs.
 
 No definite slight left apical pneumothorax.  Left base atelectasis and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angles again noted, similar to prior.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, with a prosthetic valve and mediastinal
 surgical clips, is probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences.
 
 Again seen is a thin catheter curving over the mediastinum with its tip
 adjacent to the left clavicular head, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of 2 right-sided chest tubes.  The small right apical
 pneumothorax is similar, but very slightly larger.
