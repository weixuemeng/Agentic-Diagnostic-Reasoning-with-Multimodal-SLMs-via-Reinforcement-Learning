                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:50 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with alcohol abuse, acute liver failure and
 increasing hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:10 p.m.:
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Heart size top normal.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema is worsening radiographically, though this could be due to
 decrease in positive pressure ventilator support rather than interval cardiac
 decompensation.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular line and upper enteric drainage tube are
 all in standard positions.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not
 significant.  There is no pneumothorax.
