                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxic respiratory failure.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Right internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  The Dobbhoff tube passes below
 the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  Bibasal opacities are redemonstrated, slightly
 improved since the prior study.
 
 It is not clear if the NG tube is still in in addition to the Dobbhoff tube,
 please correlate clinically.
