                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tachycardia, hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, PA 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The opacities in the right and left lobe present on the prior chest x-ray are
 less pronounced on today's study.  However, opacification is now seen in the
 left lower lobe, which was not present on the previous film.  Lung volumes
 remain low.
 
 In view of the changing nature of the opacities, appearances most likely
 represent evidence of failure but pneumonia is not excluded.
