                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with mechanical
 ventilation, assessment for the ET tube position.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  Left internal jugular line tip is
 at the low SVC.  The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating most
 likely in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and widespread
 interstitial/alveolar opacities involving both lungs are unchanged.
 
 Lucency along the left mediastinal border might reflect air within the
 esophagus, but the assessment with chest radiograph at known time is
 recommended to exclude the possibility of mediastinal air.
