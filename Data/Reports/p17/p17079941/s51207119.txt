                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver disease with altered mental status.  Intubated.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.5 cm above the carina, not
 significantly changed.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm, ending within the stomach.  An additional orogastric tube also
 courses below the level of the diaphragm, passing out of the field of view
 inferiorly.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low
 SVC.  There is a diffuse bilateral lung interstitial abnormality that is not
 significantly changed compared to the prior study from ___ and
 could be due to underlying interstitial edema.  Heterogeneous left
 retrocardiac opacities are thought to be moderate atelectasis.  There is
 minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Lung volumes are low, decreased compared to
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned lines and tubes.
 
 2.  No significant interval change in widespread bilateral lung interstitial
 opacities, likely interstitial edema.  Moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis,
 not significantly changed.
