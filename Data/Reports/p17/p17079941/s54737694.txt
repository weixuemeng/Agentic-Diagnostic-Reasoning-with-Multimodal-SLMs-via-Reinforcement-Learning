                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:31 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new Dobbhoff tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:51 a.m.:
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has been stable in the right lung
 for several days.  Left lung has improved.  Precise nature of this abnormality
 is unclear to me.  It is not due to cardiogenic edema since heart is normal
 size and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement.  
 
 Series of three sequential radiographs shows ultimate positioning of the
 Dobbhoff feeding tube, initially in the hypopharynx, ultimately in the upper
 stomach, looping just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 There appears to be another tube in the upper esophagus, ending roughly at the
 level of the aortic knob.  I have paged the house officer caring for this
 patient for clarification.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
