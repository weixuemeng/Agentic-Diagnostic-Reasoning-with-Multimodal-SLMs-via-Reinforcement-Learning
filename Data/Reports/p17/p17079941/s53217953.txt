                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mechanical ventilation.  Assess endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back through ___, including
 the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 3.2 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid-to-low SVC,
 unchanged.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm,
 curving superiorly to end in the gastric cardia.  A Dobbhoff tube also passes
 below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  An
 additional tube/wire projects over the right cervical region, possibly
 external to the patient, unchanged.  Widespread bilateral interstitial
 opacities are minimally increased, particularly within the right mid lung. 
 Bibasilar left greater than right heterogeneous opacities are likely
 atelectasis.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The heart size is top normal, unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval increase in widespread bilateral interstitial opacities.
 
 2.  Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
 
 3.  Unchanged positioning of support lines and tubes.
