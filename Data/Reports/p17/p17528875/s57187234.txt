 HISTORY:  Right upper lobe pneumonia.

 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The previously seen wedge-shaped density inferior to the right
 hilus has nearly completely resolved with subtle density remaining on lateral
 view.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near complete resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia with remaining density
 likely representing residual scarring.
