                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval marked improvement in pulmonary edema with only minimal
 residual interstitial edema remaining.  Associated decreased size of cardiac
 silhouette now upper limits of normal.  Enlarged central pulmonary artery
 suggests the possibility of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Small pleural
 effusions have decreased in size.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note
 is made of previous vertebroplasty at the site of a compression fracture in
 the mid thoracic spine.
 
 Note is also made of hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting underlying COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Marked improvement in pulmonary edema.
 2.  Enlarged central pulmonary arteries, suggesting the possibility of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
