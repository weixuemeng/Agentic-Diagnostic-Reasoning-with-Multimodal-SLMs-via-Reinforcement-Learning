                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar opacities are likely
 due to atelectasis.  Small pleural effusions are similar to ___. 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal allowing for low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged centrally without overt pulmonary edema.  Degenerative change is
 noted at the acromioclavicular joints bilaterally. Prior thoracic
 vertebroplasty again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
 Pulmonary vasculature is engorged.
