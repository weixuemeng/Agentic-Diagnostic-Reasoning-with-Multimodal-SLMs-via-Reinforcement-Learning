                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a COPD exacerbation.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is not definitively visualized, but likely
 terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends into
 the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is
 stable hyperinflation of the lungs bilaterally.  Stable, increased lucency at
 the lung bases is suggestive of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.  Linear
 densities in the peripheral right mid lung may reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable, hyperinflation of the lungs bilaterally, consistent with known
 COPD.  Basal predominant lucency is suggestive of alpha-1 antitrypsin
 deficiency.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
