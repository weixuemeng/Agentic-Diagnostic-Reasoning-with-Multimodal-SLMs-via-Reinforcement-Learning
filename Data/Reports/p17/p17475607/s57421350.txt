                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pitting edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Linear areas of
 atelectasis/scarring are seen in the left mid-to-lower lung field.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No overt pulmonary edema.
