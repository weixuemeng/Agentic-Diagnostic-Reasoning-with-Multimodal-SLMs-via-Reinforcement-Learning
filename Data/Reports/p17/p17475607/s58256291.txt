 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral foot swelling, pain similar to prior MI, with
 asthma exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  A linear density again
 seen in the left mid to lower lung is consistent with scarring.  The lungs
 appear hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema without superimposed pneumonia.
