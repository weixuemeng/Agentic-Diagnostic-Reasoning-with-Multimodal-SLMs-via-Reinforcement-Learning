 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms most likely

 and within normal limits. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely
 reflect areas of scarring and/or subsegmental atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. COPD.
