 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, a left chest tube has been
 removed.  The extent of the left pneumothorax is unchanged.  At the level of
 the left costophrenic sinus, there still is evidence of a small left fluid
 retention.  The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable.  Postoperative
 changes surround the left hilus.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases.
