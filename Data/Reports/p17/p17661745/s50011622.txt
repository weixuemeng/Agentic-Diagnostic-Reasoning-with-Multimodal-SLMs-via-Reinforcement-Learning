                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left VATS.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 No pneumothorax is noted on the right, but small amount of apical air
 collection is noted on the left related to the surgery.  Left basal
 consolidation appears to be slightly increased since the prior study most
 likely reflecting area of atelectasis associated with small amount of pleural
 effusion.  Minimal amount of pleural fluid is noted on the right as well.
