                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left lower lobe VATS, status post pneumonia,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung has increased
 in volume, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Opacity at the left lung
 bases, partly obliterating the left costophrenic sinus and potentially
 associated with a small left pleural effusion is unchanged in appearance. 
 This change likely reflects the known pneumonia.  On the right, the
 pre-existing small pleural effusion has completely resolved.  The appearance
 of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
