                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  There are a few
 tiny focal densities scattered throughout the right lung suggestive of
 granulomas. There is however no evidence of active granulomatous disease. The
 lungs are otherwise clear with no evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is top-normal.  Osseous structures are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Top-normal heart size.
