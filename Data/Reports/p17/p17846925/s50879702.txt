                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Intermittent substernal chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  Small right hilar calcifications suggest prior
 granulamtous exposure.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear
 clear.  Nondisplaced fractures involving the posterior right fifth through
 seventh rib fractures appear probably old.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probably old right-sided rib fractures.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
