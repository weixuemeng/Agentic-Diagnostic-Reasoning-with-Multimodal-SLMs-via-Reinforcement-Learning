                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with progressive shortness of breath,
 any concerning features, any signs of COPD.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is status post sternotomy and presence of multiple surgical
 clips is indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 with a configuration suggesting a left ventricular prominence.  Mild left
 atrial enlargement is also present as seen on the lateral view.  The thoracic
 aorta is mildly widened and elongated and demonstrates calcium deposits in the
 wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates
 an upper zone redistribution pattern.  There is presently no evidence of
 interstitial or alveolar edema and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  No evidence of acute new parenchymal infiltrates are identified and
 no pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.  When comparison is made with a
 single view chest examination of ___, findings are grossly
 unaltered, but it is noted that the upper zone redistribution pattern was not
 present at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiac enlargement and evidence of upper zone
 redistribution pattern in the pulmonary circulation suggestive of mild chronic
 pulmonary congestion.  There is no radiographic evidence of emphysema, so the
 patient's progressive shortness of breath is probably cardiogenic.
