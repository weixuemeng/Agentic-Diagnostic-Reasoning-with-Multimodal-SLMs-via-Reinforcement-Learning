                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening left-sided weakness, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Aortic knob calcifications are again seen.  There
 is persistent upper zone vascular redistribution, compatible with chronic
 congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Linear opacity within the right
 lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chornic mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
