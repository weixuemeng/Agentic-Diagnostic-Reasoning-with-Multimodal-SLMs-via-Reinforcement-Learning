                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  A very subtle opacity projects over
 the left mid lung, just lateral to the left pulmonary artery.  No nodule,
 effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the left mid lung could represent an early
 pneumonia in the correct clinical context.
