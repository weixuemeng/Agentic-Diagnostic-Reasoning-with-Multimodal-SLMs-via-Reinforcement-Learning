                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Linear opacities seen best anteriorly on the lateral view are
 probably right middle lobe atelectasis which could be due to obstruction from
 bronchial infection.  Lateral view also suggests a 13mm nodule projecting over
 the aorta just cephalad to the left hemidiaphragm.  Pleural surfaces are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.  Suggest elective PA and later chest radiographs in
 4 weeks to examine possible lower lobe lung nodule. The images should be
 obtained during weekday hours and reviewed by a chest radiologist to see if
 oblique or other views are indicated then. ED QA nurses notified by email.
