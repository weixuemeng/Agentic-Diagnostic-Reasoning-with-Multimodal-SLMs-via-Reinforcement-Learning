                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leucocytosis and hypoglycemia.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small linear opacity at the left base is more prominent than in
 the prior exam.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left basilar opacity, which given the size, is likely
 atelectasis.  An early pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the proper
 clinical setting.
