                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pain radiating to back.  Evaluation for mediastinal
 widening or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest.  
 
 A dual-chamber cardiac pacer is present.  There is moderate cardiomegaly, and
 an unfolded, slightly tortuous aorta.  There are coarse increased interstitial
 markings throughout both lung bases, consistent with mild interstitial edema.
 There is no overt pulmonary edema. Kerley B lines are noted and could reflect
 chronic CHF. Increased retrocardiac density may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and CHF findings.  No definite focal consolidation. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.   Incidental note made of soft tissue
 anchor over left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.
