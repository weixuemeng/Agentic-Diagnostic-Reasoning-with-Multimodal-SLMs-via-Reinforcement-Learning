                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  CTA chest
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is notably right-ward rotated, limiting the evaluation.
 Heart size is not well evaluated but enlarged.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited by patient rotated. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atalectasis, although pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the right
 clinical setting.  If further evaluation is desired, repeat formal PA and
 lateral radiographs would be helpful.
