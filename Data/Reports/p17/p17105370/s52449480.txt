                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Ischemic bowel and intubated.  Evaluate for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest radiograph at 2:56 a.m. and 1:03 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right IJ is in the proximal right atrium.  ET tube terminates
 approximately 3 cm from the carina.  There is no large pneumothorax. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis persists.  Worsening bilateral opacities likely reflect
 evolving pulmonary edema.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum is
 better evaluated on concurrent CT of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 3 cm from the carina.
 2.  Right IJ in the upper right atrium should be withdrawn approximately 3 cm
 to place it safely in the low SVC.
 3.  Evolving pulmonary edema.
 
 These results were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 5:56 a.m.,
 ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
