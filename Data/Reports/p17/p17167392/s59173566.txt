                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Three days of increased dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided pacemaker device is
 noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, and
 region of the coronary sinus.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is present, and the aorta is unfolded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, with small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. 
 Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 present.  There are clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, which
 denote prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
