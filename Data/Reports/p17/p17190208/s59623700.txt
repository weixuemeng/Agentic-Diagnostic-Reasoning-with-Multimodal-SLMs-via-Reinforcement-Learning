 shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is fully

 central venous catheter, left IJ central venous catheter, enteric tube, and VP
 shunt appear unchanged and appropriately positioned.

 New, left lung atelectasis and lingular consolidation suggest recent
 aspiration or new airway obstruction.
