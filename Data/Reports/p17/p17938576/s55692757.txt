                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of small cell lung cancer.  Please evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  Abnormal contour of the
 pneumomediastinum at the level of the azygos vein and enlargement of the right
 hilus is consistent with patient's known malignancy seen on the reference
 chest CT.  Nodule in the mid right lung corresponds to the nodule seen on the
 CT.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis as well as interstitial fibrosis at
 the lung bases bilaterally.  There may be a tiny right pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase of opacification at the right lung base
 which may be secondary to atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process
 cannot be excluded.
