                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and hypertension.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison with no prior
 studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The assessment of the mediastinum demonstrates abnormal
 contour at the level of the azygos vein, potentially representing
 lymphadenopathy and less likely to represent only the azygos vein.  The right
 hilus is enlarged.  There is right lower lobe and left lower lobe
 consolidation concerning for infection.  There is potentially present small
 amount of pleural effusion.  Old rib fracture is noted.
 
 Further assessment of the patient with chest CT for precise characterization
 of the right hilus and right paratracheal area is required.
