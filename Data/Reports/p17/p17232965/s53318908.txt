                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with spinal stenosis, preoperative chest
 radiograph.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are well
 expanded.  Diffuse coarse interstitial markings are again noted, predominantly
 involving the bases, without evidence of focal consolidation.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is normal in size, and
 cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Deformity of the right lateral
 chest wall is noted.  Patient is status post spinal fusion at multiple levels
 which is partially imaged.  A vascular stent is also partially imaged anterior
 to the spine in the lower part of the image, likely within the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarse interstitial marking with basilar predominance, likely
 reflective of chronic lung disease without evidence of an acute intrathoracic
 abnormality.
