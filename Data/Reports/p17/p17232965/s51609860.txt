                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with pulmonary edema.  Now status post
 diuresis.  Please evaluate for resolution of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP and lateral view of the chest shows stable large lung volume with
 interval improvement of lung base opacity and interstitial markings probably
 due to improved interstitial pulmonary edema.  Heart size still moderately
 enlarged with reduced size of the vascular pedicle, for improved central vein
 distention.  There is  a small left pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax. 
 Right chest wall deformity and spinal fixation hardware are unchanged.
