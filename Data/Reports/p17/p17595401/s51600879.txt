  1.  Mild increase in left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia,
  although differential includes asymmetric pulmonary edema and atelectasis. 
  Clinical correlation is recommended.
  2. Interval increase in moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left
  greater than right, pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath, hypoxia and congestive heart
 failure.  Assess congestive heart failure versus acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi-upright chest radiographdemonstrates intact median
 sternotomy wires.
 
 Lung volumes are low with crowding of vasculature.  There is moderate
 pulmonary edema with cephalization of vasculature.  Mild increase in left base
 opacity is noted.  Small bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions
 have slightly increased in size since previous examination.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient
 positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits. Posterior
 fusion device of thoracic spine is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild increase in left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia,
 although differential includes asymmetric pulmonary edema and atelectasis. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
 2. Interval increase in moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left
 greater than right, pleural effusions.
