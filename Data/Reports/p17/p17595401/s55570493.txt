                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with h/o CAD s/p MI, CABG c/b cardiomyopathy, afib on
 warfarin, DM, presenting s/p fall  // please eval for rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  And chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left basilar opacity which silhouette the hemidiaphragm is compatible with
 previously seen loculated effusion with adjacent atelectasis/ scar.  There is
 slightly increased opacity in the retrocardiac region when compared to prior
 which could represent progressive atelectasis/ scarring. The right lung
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Compression deformity
 in an upper lumbar vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Left basilar opacity compatible of the least partially loculated effusion and
 atelectasis/scar.  Slight increased opacity at the left lower lung could
 represent progressive atelectasis although superimposed acute process is
 possible. No definite acute fracture although if high clinical concern,
 dedicated rib series should be considered.
