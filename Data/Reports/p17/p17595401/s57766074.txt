 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker lead follows the expected course to the floor of the
 dilated right ventricle.  Small left pleural fusion is unchanged over several
 days.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Previous mild
 pulmonary edema has improved.  Residual opacification in the right lower lung
 is probably atelectasis but needs to be followed.  Severe cardiac enlargement
 is long-standing
