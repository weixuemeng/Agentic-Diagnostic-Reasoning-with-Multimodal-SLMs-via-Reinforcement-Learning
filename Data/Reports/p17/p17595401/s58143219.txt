                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ?PNA // f/u CXR for pneumonia vs
 atelectasis. Please evaluate for edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain chest radiograph dated ___. Correlation made to
 thoracic spine CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Chronic small bilateral pleural effusions have
 increased.  Despite vascular crowding, mild pulmonary edema likely persists.
 The left lower lobe airspace opacity has increased, and is worrisome for
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the
 projection. Sternotomy wires and spinal fixation hardware are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left lower lobe opacity may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
 Increased small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Stable mild pulmonary edema.
