                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CXR
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o pleural effusion, worsening
 orthopnea/PND and decreased breath sounds on left side.  // R/o pleural
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips are again seen.  There
 is an unchanged overall appearance of opacity at the left lung base which has
 been previously characterized on CT as rounded atelectasis with loculated
 small left effusion.  Allowing for slight differences in technique, no
 significant change.  There is no pneumothorax. There is no right pleural
 effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is stable
 calcification of the thoracic aorta. There is stable mild DJD and kyphosis of
 the thoracic spine. Again noted is a compression deformity of an upper lumbar
 vertebral body without interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change in left basal opacity which likely represents known area of rounded
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe with loculated small left effusion.
