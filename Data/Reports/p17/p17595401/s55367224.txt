 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 improvement in the left pleural effusion.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Some retrocardiac atelectatic change is again
 seen.  In the appropriate clinical setting, lower lung consolidation cannot be
 excluded in the absence of a lateral view.
