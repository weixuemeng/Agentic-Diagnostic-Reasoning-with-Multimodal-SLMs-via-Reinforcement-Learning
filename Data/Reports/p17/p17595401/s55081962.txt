 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior study.  Mediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are stable.  A small left-sided effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis is unchanged from prior examination.  There is subtly increased
 heterogeneous density in the right lung base with corresponding with increased
 retrocardiac opacity on lateral view suspicious for pneumonia.  Subpleural
 scarring in the mid left lung field is unchanged.  There is no frank
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
