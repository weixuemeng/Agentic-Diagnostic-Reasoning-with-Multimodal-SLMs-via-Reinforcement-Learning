                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive pulmonary abnormalities appear
 unchanged.  These are not fully characterized, but suggest extensive scarring
 or interstitial disease that may also coincide with underlying emphysema and
 probably bronchiectasis; chronic infection is a differential diagnosis.  There
 is no evidence of superimposed acute disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive underlying pulmonary abnormality, not significantly changed over the
 fairly short interval.  No definite evidence of acute disease, however. 
 Differential considerations include chronic infection in the setting of
 background lung disease.  Correlation to more remote prior radiographs is
 recommended, if available.  It may be otherwise be appropriate to consider
 chest CT to characterize further when clinically appropriate if the etiology
 is not known.
