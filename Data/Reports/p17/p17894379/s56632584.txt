 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous as seen
 previously. Mild pulmonary edema is not substantially changed in the interval.
 Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions have nearly completely
 resolved. No pneumothorax is present. Patchy opacities in the retrocardiac
 region may reflect atelectasis. There is no acute osseous abnormality.

 Mild pulmonary edema, as seen on the previous study, with near complete
 resolution of previously seen small bilateral pleural effusions.
