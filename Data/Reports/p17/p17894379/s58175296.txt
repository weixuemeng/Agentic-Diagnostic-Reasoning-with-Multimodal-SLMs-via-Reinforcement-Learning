                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with prior history of fall and fractured ribs now
 with new onset delirium. Crackles on lung exam R >L  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  Previous median
 sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft clips noted.  Even allowing for
 the projection, the heart is moderately to severely enlarged.  Haziness of
 pulmonary vasculature is consistent with congestive heart failure.  The extent
 of airspace opacities slightly decreased when compared to the prior study
 consistent with slight interval improvement in the known pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Possible slight interval improvement in the moderate pulmonary edema.
