                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of right-sided chest
 pain, rule out rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable since the prior study.  There is perihilar vascular
 prominence suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion with possible minimal
 interstitial edema.  Lateral view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm
 per the radiology technologist, the patient was unable to lift arms for the
 lateral view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation although an infectious process at the left lung base could be
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion with possible minimal interstitial
 edema, superimposed infectious process is difficult to exclude at left lung
 base.  No displaced rib fracture is seen, although if clinical concern for rib
 fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
