                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with stroke-like symptoms, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There are increased interstitial markings on the
 frontal view which may be due to relatively lower lung volumes compared to
 prior as the lateral exam demonstrates grossly clear lungs.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but stable. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic arch.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
