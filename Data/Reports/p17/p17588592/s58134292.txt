                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is moderate to severely enlarged with a somewhat globular
 configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette likely due to
 cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Echocardiogram may be
 helpful to exclude an underlying pericardial effusion.
