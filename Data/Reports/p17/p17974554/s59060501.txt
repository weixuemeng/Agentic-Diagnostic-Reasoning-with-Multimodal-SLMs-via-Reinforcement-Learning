                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with RIJ, attempted subclavian  // eval RIJ , any
 e/o PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous line, with
 the tip terminating in the mid SVC.  Extensive bibasilar opacities are again
 noted with associated cystic abnormalities, correlating with the patient's
 known severe bronchiectasis and mucous impaction.  Superimposed consolidation
 in the right mid and lower lung have progressed in the interval, with
 associated worsening peribronchial cuffing in the right perihilar region.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right IJ CVL terminating in the mid SVC.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Diffuse, severe bibasilar bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.  Worsening
 superimposed consolidation in the right mid and lower lung is concerning for
 evolving infectious pneumonia.
