                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA and CP/dyspnea  // r/o consolidation,
 pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, multifocal bilateral
 consolidations involving the right lung to a greater than degree than the left
 have slightly improved.  The consolidations are superimposed on widespread
 cystic bronchiectasis with lower lung predominance as well as multifocal small
 airways disease, both more fully characterized on recent chest CT.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for decrease in size of small left pleural effusion and
 slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion with apparent
 loculation laterally.
