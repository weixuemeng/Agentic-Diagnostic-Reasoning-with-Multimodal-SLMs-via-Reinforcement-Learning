                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities with cystic lucencies correlate with the patient's known,
 severe bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction.  Overall, the extent of
 bronchiectasis appears grossly unchanged from the prior examination dated ___ except for minimal improvement in the periphery of the right
 lower lobe.  The upper lungs are grossly clear.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged, with known aneurysmal dilation of ascending aorta, more fully
 evaluated by prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged, severe bibasilar bronchiectasis with extensive mucoid impaction. 
 The severity and extent of bronchiectasis suggests an underlying congenital
 cause.
