 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right PICC line evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is in
 unchanged position.  The tip of the line projects over the mid-to-low SVC. 
 Along the line, there is no evidence of kinking or other changes.  The lung
 volumes have increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  No pleural
 effusions.  No parenchymal opacities.
