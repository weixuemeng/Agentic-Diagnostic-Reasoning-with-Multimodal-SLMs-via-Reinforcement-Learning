                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of PICC line placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  The patient most likely
 underwent interim sternotomy or sternectomy since the sternal wires are not
 visible on the current examination.  Bilateral pleural effusion is small. 
 Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are noted, also small but both findings are new
 since the prior examination.  Most likely post-mediastinal surgery, drains are
 projecting over the chest.
