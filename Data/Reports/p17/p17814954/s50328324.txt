                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ known AAA (stable) and chronic aortic occlusion p/w
 hematuria (in setting of +UA) and dyspnea on exertion s/p aorto-bifem bypass w
 dyspnea/incr O2 req  // assess pulm edema?    assess pulm edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion is new.  This may account for wall of the new
 opacification projecting over the right lower lung, but that finding also
 raises question of pneumonia or new atelectasis, since trachea was extubated
 in the interim and there is new, more readily recognizable edema at the left
 base.  Pulmonary vasculature is also engorged today suggesting early cardiac
 decompensation.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in the
 stomach but would need to be advanced at least 6 cm to move all the side ports
 beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
