                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/pCABG, postop right apical PTX  // ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the right apical pneumothorax remains
 relatively small, but is slightly larger than on the prior study.  No discrete
 right-sided atelectasis is identified.
 
 The enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with sternotomy wires is grossly
 unchanged.  Mild prominence of vessels is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes. Doubt overt CHF
 
 The degree of increased retrocardiac density has improved, with the left
 hemidiaphragm now visible.  There is atelectasis in left mid zone.  No gross
 effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper zone pneumothorax has increased notably compared with ___, but remains relatively small.  It lies between the right third and
 fourth posterior ribs.
 
 Interval improvement in the degree of retrocardiac opacity.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant change allowing for differences in positioning.
