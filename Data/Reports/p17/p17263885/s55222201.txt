                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Asthma, dementia, hypertension presenting with chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there are low lung volumes.  On the lateral view, there are
 stable reticular markings seen at the lung base posteriorly, possibly slightly
 increased since the prior study, consistent with chronic lung disease.  No
 definite new focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Left acromioclavicular joint
 arthropathy is again noted, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without overt
 pulmonary edema.
