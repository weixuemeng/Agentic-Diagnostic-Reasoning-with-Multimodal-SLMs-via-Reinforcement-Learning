                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of CHF and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:27, earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  A slight increase
 in interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to minimal interstitial edema
 versus less likely atypical infection.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  There
 is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a trace pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse slight increase in interstitial markings bilaterally may
 be due to mild interstitial edema, less likely atypical infection.  Small left
 pleural effusion.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further
 evaluation if and when patient able.
