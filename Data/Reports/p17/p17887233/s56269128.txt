                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is a left greater than right prominent plate-like
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded on the left.  There is
 slight blunting of the costophrenic angles which may be due to low lung
 volumes; however, a trace pleural effusion, particularly on the left, is not
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with left greater than right prominent
 plate-like atelectasis and mid lung atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural
 effusion.  Underlying left basilar consolidation not excluded.
