 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, without focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. Prior right posterior rib
 fractures with deformity are again seen.  There are small bilateral effusions
 and bibasilar atelectasis.   Severe degenerative changes of the right
 acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joint again seen.  Bilateral high riding
 humeral heads likely reflect chronic rotator cuff disease.
