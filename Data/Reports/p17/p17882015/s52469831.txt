                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To look for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Though this study is not dedicated for evaluation of bone
 pathology, there is no limitations.
 
 There is no evidence of rib fracture.  A very vague and mildly increased
 opacity in the left upper lung could be from summation of the bone and soft
 tissue shadows.  No lung opacities concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Both pleural spaces are normal.  Heart size is normal, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of rib fracture.  However, since this study is not
 tailored for evaluation of the bone pathologies, should the clinical concern
 for rib fracture persists, dedicated rib views with markers at the site of
 clinical suspicion is recommended.
