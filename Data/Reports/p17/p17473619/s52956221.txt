                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Exam is limited by patient positioning with the patient's chin obscuring a
 portion of the right apex.  Low lung volumes are demonstrated.  The heart size
 is difficult to assess, but is likely within normal limits.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Opacification of the right lung base likely reflects a combination
 of consolidation with small right pleural effusion.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There is gaseous
 distention of the stomach.  Severe S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar
 spine is demonstrated with multilevel degenerative changes.  Partially imaged
 are severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint.  Remote
 left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Right basilar opacity is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration
 with a small right pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Gaseous distention of the stomach incidentally
 noted.
