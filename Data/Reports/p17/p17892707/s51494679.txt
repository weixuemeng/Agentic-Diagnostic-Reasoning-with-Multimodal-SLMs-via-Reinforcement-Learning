                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma now
 febrile with neutropenia, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:05.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film on ___ at 11:15 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath remains unchanged in position.  There has been a
 median sternotomy.  Given differences in positioning, the overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable with the heart being stably enlarged. 
 Focal retrocardiac opacity is seen, which could represent an area of patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia could also have this appearance.
 Clinical correlation is advised. Small layering right pleural effusion.  No
 large left effusion is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
