                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a thoracentesis on the
 left with removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid.  No definite
 pneumothorax.
 
 There are two curvilinear opacifications symmetrically bilaterally that mimic
 pneumothoraces.  These could represent merely an unusual appearance to the
 anterior portion of the first ribs, possibly reflecting calcification of
 costal cartilage.
 
 Persistent opacification at the right base, though less prominent than on the
 previous study.
