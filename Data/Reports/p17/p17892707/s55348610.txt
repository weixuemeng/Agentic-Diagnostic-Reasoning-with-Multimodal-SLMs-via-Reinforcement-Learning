                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left-sided thoracentesis, check for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval decrease in left pleural effusion after thoracentesis.
 No pneumothorax is present.  The right pleural effusion is unchanged; however,
 there is increased volume loss with an opacity silhouetting the right heart
 border consistent with collapse of the right middle lobe and atelectasis of
 the right lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  A left
 Port is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in left pleural effusion after thoracentesis with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Increased volume loss on the right with opacity silhouetting the right
 heart border consistent with collapse of right middle lobe with right sided
 effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis.
