                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pigtail drain in right pleural space.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, with the catheter in place
 there is some improvement in the right effusion.  Some increased opacification
 in the retrocardiac region suggests left effusion with volume loss in the
 lower lobe.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
