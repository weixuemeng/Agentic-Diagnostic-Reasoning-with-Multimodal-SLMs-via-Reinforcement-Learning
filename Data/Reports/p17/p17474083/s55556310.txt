 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:45 AM
  Compared with examination from 10 hours prior.  Limited examination given
  patient's body habitus.
  
  Again seen are patchy bilateral opacities, similar to prior examination.  The
  central pulmonary vasculature is engorged.  Possible right basilar
  consolidation is present, though these findings may be related to edema. 
  Possible small right pleural effusion is present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxemia 
 // eval for pulmonary edema, pneumonia, other pathology      eval for
 pulmonary edema, pneumonia, other pathology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at
 13:55.
 
 Overall pulmonary opacification has worsened slightly, probably pulmonary
 edema.  Lobulation of the right hilus is concerning for adenopathy.  Heart is
 top-normal size.  Mitral annulus is probably heavily calcified, and could
 contribute to mitral regurgitation.  Pleural effusions are presumed but not
 substantial.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs when acute edema has
 resolved to evaluate enlarged right hilus and look for other adenopathy.
