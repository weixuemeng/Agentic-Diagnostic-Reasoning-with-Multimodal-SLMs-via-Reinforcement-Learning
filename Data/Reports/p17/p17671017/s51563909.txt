                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, status post bronchoscopy with biopsies, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 increase in size of a dense consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe with
 surrounding airspace opacity.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains normal in size, the mediastinal contours remain normal.  Median
 sternotomy wires are fractured at nearly all visible levels.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right upper lobe mass-like opacity likely
 secondary to post-biopsy hemorrhage or lavage surrounding pre-existing mass,
 without evidence of pneumothorax.
