                                 FINAL REPORT
 there are chronic lower lung opacities compatible with bronchiectasis and
 scarring in the lingula and right middle lobe.  In addition, there are faint
 peripheral nodules seen in both lungs, most confluent in the right mid lung,
 somewhat more prominent than prior.  Findings may be indicative of acute on
 chronic atypical infection.  No pneumothorax.  No large effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for acute on chronic atypical mycobacterial
 infection.
