                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with stroke.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs which are without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Peribronchial wall thickening is noted,
 most prominent in the right perihilar region.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.  Peribronchial wall
 thickening is suggestive of acute bronchitis in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
