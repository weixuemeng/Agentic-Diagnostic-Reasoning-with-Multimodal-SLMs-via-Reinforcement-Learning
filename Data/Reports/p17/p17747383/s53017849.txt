                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain status post MVA.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are clear.  No confluent opacities
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  No definite rib fracture is identified on this
 chest radiograph examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 2) No definite rib fracture visualized.  Dedicated rib views could be
 considered if there is ongoing clinical concern.
 
 3) Slight posterior angulation of the xiphoid.  In the absence of focal
 tendnderness, this likely represents normal variation rather than traumatic
 injury. Sternum otherwise within normal limits radiographically.
