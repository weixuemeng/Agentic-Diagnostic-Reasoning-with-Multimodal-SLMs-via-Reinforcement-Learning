 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest ___ at 08:50 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered.  The pulmonary artery is also
 prominent which raises the possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, which is of
 uncertain significance.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
