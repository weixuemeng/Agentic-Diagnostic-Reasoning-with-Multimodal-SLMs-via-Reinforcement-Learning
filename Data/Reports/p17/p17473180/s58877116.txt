 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:51 PM
  Left pleural drain in slightly inferior position compared to the prior exam. 
  Blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle is consistent with a small
  pleural effusion.  No substantial left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or
  focal consolidation.  Incompletely imaged right upper quadrant biliary drain
  and stent.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with left pleural effusion after thoracentesis and a
 pigtail placement on ___.  Persistent hypoxia.  Evaluate size of effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small right pleural effusion new or newly apparent, but not sufficient to
 produce hypoxia.  There has been no recurrence of left pleural effusion. 
 Relative elevation of the base of the right lung suggests that some of the
 right pleural effusion is subpulmonic.  Left pleural catheter is visible on
 the frontal view at the base of the left hemithorax, inferior to its previous
 location, probably in the posterior pleural sulcus.  Aside from a new band of
 atelectasis in the left lower lung, lungs are essentially clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  More pronounced thoracic scoliosis is
 probably positional.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of cardiac decompensation.
