                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited by patient positioning and patient's left arm obscuring
 assessment of the left costophrenic angle.  The heart size is normal.  The
 aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen within the left lung base, which
 could reflect atelectasis.  Assessment for a left-sided pleural effusion is
 limited as the patient's arm obscures this area.  No right-sided focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam. Left basilar patchy opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.
