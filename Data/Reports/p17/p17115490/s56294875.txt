 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:28 PM
  Interval worsening of near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax,
  likely related to large left-sided pleural effusion as seen on outside chest
  CT, however evaluation of pleural thickening underlying lesion is limited.
  There is also rightward deviation of the cardiomediastinal structures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is near-complete of opacification of left hemithorax, worsened since
 prior chest radiograph from ___ at 07:05 and likely related to a
 large left-sided pleural effusion as seen on outside chest CT. However,
 evaluation of underlying pleural thickening for underlying lesion is limited
 in this examination. There is rightward shift of the cardiomediastinal
 structures. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could also reflect a
 small pleural effusion, new since the radiograph from earlier today. There is
 atelectasis at the right lung base. No large pneumothorax identified on this
 portable chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval worsening of near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax,
 likely related to large left-sided pleural effusion as seen on outside chest
 CT.
 2. New small right pleural effusion.
