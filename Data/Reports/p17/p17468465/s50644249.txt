                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dCHF, pericardial effusion s/p pericardial
 drain.  // Is ET tube in place?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13 24
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with the prior study, an ET tube is now in place, tip 7 point 7 cm
 above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads.  An NG tube is
 present, tip over fundus.  A pericardial drain is noted.  The right IJ sheath
 is present, tip over proximal SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent, likely related to background enlargement, as well as low
 inspiratory volumes, AP technique and interval intervention.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation
 all and minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  The left hemidiaphragm
 remains visible.  No CHF.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. 
 No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes, as described.
 Low inspiratory volumes, with left lower lobe atelectasis and minimal right
 base atelectasis.
 No CHF, gross effusion, or pneumothorax detected.
