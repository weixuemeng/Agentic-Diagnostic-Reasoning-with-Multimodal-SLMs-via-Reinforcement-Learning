                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as earlier CT
 and MR studies dated ___, and ___, respectively.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is again at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta shows mild
 unfolding.  A right upper mediastinal density produces an oval shadow
 measuring up to ___ x 40 mm which can be compared to the prior radiographic
 appearance from ___ when the same measurement within ___ x 25 mm so there has
 been an increase.  However, previous studies showed that there was a benign
 cyst at the site so the appearance is consistent with some long-term increase
 in the size of a benign cyst.  The airway is again splayed minimally to the
 left but does not appear narrowed or under substantial mass effect.  The lungs
 appear clear.  There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of mediastinal cyst.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
