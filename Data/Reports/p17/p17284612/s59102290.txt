 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:21 AM
  
  
  
  1.  Limited evaluation due to patient positioning
  2.  Increased retrocardiac opacity is likely combination of severe left lower
  lobe atelectasis and worsening left pleural effusion.  Superimposed infection
  cannot be excluded.
  3.  Right upper lobe atelectasis is noted.
  4.  Left upper lobe lucency is likely projectional due to patient positioning
  however a small pneumothorax layering along the anterior pleural surface
  cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph with better
  positioning.
  5.  Endotracheal tube tip difficult to assess and may be at level of thoracic
  inlet.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shock cardiogenic vs septic, acute
 respiratory failure s/p intubation.  Assess for interval line check or pleural
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___, there is increased opacification of the
 left lung base consistent with combination of substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and left pleural effusion.  Otherwise little change.  Left
 upper lobe lucency is projectional due to patient positioning rather than
 pneumothorax.  Heart is partially obscured due to parenchymal abnormality. 
 Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Enteric feeding tube courses midline with tip out of field of view.  A right
 IJ CVL tip is in the low SVC.  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased left lung opacification is combination of worsening left lower
 lobe volume loss and left pleural effusion.
 2. Otherwise, little change.
 3. Monitoring and support devices are in good position.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with Dr.___, M.D. by ___,
 M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 6:06 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
