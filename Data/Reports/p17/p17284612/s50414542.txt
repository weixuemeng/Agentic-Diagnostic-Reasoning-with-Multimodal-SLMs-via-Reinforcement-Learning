                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a productive cough for two days.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Due to limitations of imaging in patient of this size, I cannot be sure
 whether there is new consolidation in the right middle lobe, but that is
 suggested by both frontal and lateral views.  I would treat the patient for
 pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and
 there is some vascular congestion but no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
