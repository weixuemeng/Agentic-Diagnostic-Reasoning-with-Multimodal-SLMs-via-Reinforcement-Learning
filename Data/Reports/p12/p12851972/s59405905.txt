 HISTORY:  Fever, diarrhea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Prominent costochondral calcifications are seen bilaterally.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There
 is slight increase in opacity in the bilateral suprahilar regions, infectious
 process is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs consistent with COPD.  Subtle reticular increase in
 opacity in the bilateral suprahilar regions could be due to underlying
 infection.
