                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP
 diameter suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Blunting of the
 bilateral posterior costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions.  Mid
 lung atelectasis is seen on the lateral view.  Extensive costochondral
 calcifications are seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  Slight
 prominence of the aortic knob is grossly stable since ___.  Subtle
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to hiatal hernia or atelectasis.  Some
 compression deformities along the lower thoracic spine are again seen but not
 optimally evaluated on the study.
