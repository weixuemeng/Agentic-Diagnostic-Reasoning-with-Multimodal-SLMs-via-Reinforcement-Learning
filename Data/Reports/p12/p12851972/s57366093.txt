                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and new oxygen requirement.  History of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is a new moderate interstitial abnormality with peribronchial cuffing that is
 largely confined to the upper lobes with recent onset, suggesting that it may
 indeed reflect pulmonary edema.  However, there is some asymmetry, noting more
 opacification in the right upper lung than left; multifocal pneumonia would be
 an additional consideration, depending on clinical circumstances.
