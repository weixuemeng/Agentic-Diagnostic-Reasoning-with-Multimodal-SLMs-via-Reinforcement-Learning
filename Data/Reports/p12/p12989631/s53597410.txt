                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Female with new pacemaker.  Assess for lead placement and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-chamber pacemaker with generator is in left pectoral region
 with leads ending in right ventricle and body of right atrium.  Distal tip of
 right internal jugular line is at origin of right brachiocephalic vein. 
 Sternotomy wires are in correct placement.
 
 Increase in bilateral basilar pleural effusions left greater then right. No
 focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Heart size and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Cannot
 exclude bleeding; however, concurrent increase in pleural effusion on both
 sides argue against this.
