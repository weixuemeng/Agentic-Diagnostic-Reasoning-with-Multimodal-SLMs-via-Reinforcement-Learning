 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly CV air as well as mediastinal widening. Since the prior study
 there has been interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema with
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Rib fractures are
 better appreciated on the prior chest CT. Interstitial changes in the lung
 bases are currently obscured by interval development of the pulmonary edema.
