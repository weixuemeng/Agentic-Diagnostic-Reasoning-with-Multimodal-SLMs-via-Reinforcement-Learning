                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy for lymphoma, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is the suggestion
 of some increased opacification in the retrocardiac region.  Although this may
 merely be related to atelectasis or even a technical artifact, in the
 appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia at the left base would have
 to be considered.
