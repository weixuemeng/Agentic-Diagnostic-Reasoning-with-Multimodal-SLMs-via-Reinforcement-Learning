                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with N/V, ABD pain, chest pain, syncope  // Evidence of
 acute CP process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. The lungs however remain clear
 without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. Calcification in the region of the AP
 window is likely a calcified lymph node and possible subcarinal calcified
 lymph nodes are also identified. There is a posterior indentation of the
 trachea just below the thoracic inlet, potentially due to adjacent tortuous
 great vessels although enlarged thyroid would also be possible. Degenerative
 changes noted at the shoulders bilaterally. No acute osseous abnormality.
 There is no free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Posterior displacement of the trachea just below the thoracic inlet
 potentially due to thyroid enlargement vs tortuous great vessels. Consider
 thyroid ultrasound to further characterize on a nonurgent basis.
