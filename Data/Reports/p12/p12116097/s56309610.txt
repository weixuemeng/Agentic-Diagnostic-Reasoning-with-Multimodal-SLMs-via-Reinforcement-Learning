                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with severe asthma and
 wheezing.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Minimal
 linear atelectasis in the left lower lung is noted, unlikely to represent
 infectious process, although it cannot be entirely excluded.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
