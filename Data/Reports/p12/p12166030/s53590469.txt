                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough, known previous pneumonia
 treated but not improved
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are re- demonstrated.  The cardiac silhouette appears mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Persistent eventration of the hemidiaphragms are
 noted bilaterally with associated bibasilar patchy opacities, likely
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistently low lung volumes with patchy opacities in lung bases, likely
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
