 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p lung biopsy  // Pneumothorax     
 Pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following lung biopsy, there is no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.
 Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the enlarged heart. 
 Opacification at the right base new reflects a combination of pleural fluid
 and volume loss in the lower lobe.  Probable mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.
