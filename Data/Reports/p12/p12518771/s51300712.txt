                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diastolic heart failure exacerbation  //
 eval for edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No lateral view was obtained on the ___ study.  Allowing for this, the
 appearance on the frontal view is essentially unchanged.  Again seen is an
 effusion at the right lung base, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The overall size of the opacity is similar to the prior study.
 Today's lateral view shows fluid extending along the fissure anteriorly as
 well as a small effusion posteriorly.  The right hemidiaphragm itself is
 mostly obscured.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  There is upper
 zone redistribution  and very mild vascular plethora, without other evidence
 of CHF.
 
 In the left lung, no focal infiltrate or gross effusion is seen.  Minimal
 blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle could be present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Based on the frontal views, doubt significant interval change compared with ___.  Again seen is the effusion at the right lung base, with
 considerable obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild vascular plethora are also not
 significantly changed.
