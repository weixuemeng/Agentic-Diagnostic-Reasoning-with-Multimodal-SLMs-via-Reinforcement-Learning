                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male with cough and sputum and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated. In the right lower lobe there are streaky
 opacities with blunting of both the right cardiophrenic and costophrenic
 angles by foci of consolidations - as there is no pleural effusion in the
 lateral view. The right lung is clear. Metallic shrapnel is seen projecting
 over the left first and second ribs with apparent bony deformities at the
 site. There is also single metallic foreign body, likely located in the left
 lower lobe given localization in the frontal and lateral projections. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Streaky opacities and foci of consolidation in the right lower lobe may
 represent infectious/inflammatory in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Metallic shrapnel projecting over the left hemithorax as described above.
 Correlate with history.
