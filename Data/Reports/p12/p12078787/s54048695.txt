                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Right leg pain and transient exertional chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is small
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Streaky posterior left basilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. Moderate to severe rightward
 convex curvature is centered at the thoracic thoracolumbar junction and
 appears unchanged with incompletely characterized, but probably similar,
 degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Posterior left basilar opacity, probably consistent with atelectasis.
