                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right lower paratracheal lymph node mass and
 mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy  // Any change in mass size?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual lead pacemaker is unchanged in position when compared to the prior
 study.  A surgical pin transfixes the right clavicle.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly with a left ventricular enlargement pattern.  The right
 peritracheal lymphadenopathy is difficult to evaluate on these radiographs,
 there is no significant interval change in terms of the mediastinal contour
 when compared to the prior study.  Lung volumes are within normal limits.  No
 consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Left ventricular enlargement.
 2. The right peritracheal mass is inadequately assessed on this study.  No
 significant interval change in the mediastinal contour when compared to the
 prior study.
