                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M status post arrest status post intubation, please assess lung
 fields, tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Abandoned pacing leads are noted
 within the chest wall, some which terminate in the region the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is present.  There is moderate
 pulmonary edema with perihilar alveolar opacities.  Small left pleural
 effusion is noted.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No large pneumothorax is detected. 
 No displaced fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Moderate alveolar pulmonary edema with trace left pleural effusion.
 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
 4. Multiple abandoned pacing leads in the left chest wall.
