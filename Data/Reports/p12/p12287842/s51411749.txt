                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Assessment of the ET tube.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the
 diaphragm, most likely terminating in the stomach.  The right internal jugular
 line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged
 since the prior study obtained the same day earlier.  Left retrocardiac
 consolidation appears to be unchanged or minimally improved associated with
 most likely bilateral pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 Bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusion as well as apical consolidation
 on the left are better assessed on the CT torso from ___.
