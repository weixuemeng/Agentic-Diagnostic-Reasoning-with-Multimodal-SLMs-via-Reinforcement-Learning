 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Previous chest x-ray showed pulmonary opacities.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, except the right internal jugular vein catheter have been removed. 
 The patient still shows a relatively extensive retrocardiac opacity that might
 represent aspiration.  The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  On today's image, there
 is a relatively tortuous aorta, simulating enlargement of the right hilus.  No
 other parenchymal pathologies are currently detected.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 recent pneumonia.
