                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male found down with delirium and mild O2
 desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are slightly lower lung volumes with improved aeration and
 resolution of previously seen pulmonary edema.  Azygos vein is no longer
 dilated.  There is a persistent dense retrocardiac opacity which correlates
 with left posterior consolidation seen in the left hemithorax.  This finding
 may represent aspiration, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is stable cardiomegaly with no evidence
 of failure.  Right IJ catheter is seen in position terminating within the low
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Slightly lower lung volumes than previous study, however, there is improved
 aeration and resolution of pulmonary edema. 
 2) Persistent left posterior opacity may represent pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, or aspiration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ in person by ___
 at 12:05 p.m.
