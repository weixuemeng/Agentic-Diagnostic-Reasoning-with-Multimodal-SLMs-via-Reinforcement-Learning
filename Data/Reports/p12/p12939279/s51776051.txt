 As compared to the previous radiograph, a new feeding tube has been inserted.
 A part of the tube is coiled in the stomach. The lung volumes remain low.

 hemidiaphragm causes atelectatic areas at the left lung bases. There is mild
 fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new focal parenchymal
 opacities.
