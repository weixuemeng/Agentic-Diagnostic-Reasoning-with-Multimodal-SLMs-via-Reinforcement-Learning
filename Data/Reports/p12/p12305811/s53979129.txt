 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is present.  Costophrenic angles appear blunted,
 suggestive of small pleural effusions.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears progressed from prior study. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.
 
 Degenerative joint changes involving bilateral acromioclavicular joints, right
 greater than left, are noted with subchondral sclerosis and heterotopic bone
 formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly, and small pleural
