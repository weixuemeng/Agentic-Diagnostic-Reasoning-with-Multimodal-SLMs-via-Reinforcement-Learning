                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath now intubated.  Evaluate ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 10:29 today.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is 1.8 cm
 above the carina.  Enteric tube courses along the esophagus to the gastric,
 with distal side port terminating at the gastroesophageal junction.  A right
 jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Left pectoral pacemaker is
 unchanged.
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged.  The background of mild
 pulmonary edema is unchanged.  The heart size remains enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Advancement of the enteric tube by 7 cm would result in more optimal
 position.  
 2.  Largely unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities on a background of
 pulmonary edema.
