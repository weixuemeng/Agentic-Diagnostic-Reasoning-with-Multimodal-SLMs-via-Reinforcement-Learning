                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:44 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after cardiopulmonary arrest.  Assess lines and
 tubes and possible aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to severe multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary
 edema developed and worsened simultaneously from ___ through ___.  Subsequently, pulmonary edema has improved substantially, and
 consolidation has improved in some areas, but is still quite severe in the
 right upper lobe.  Possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage as an alternative
 explanation for some of the consolidation should be entertained, as should the
 possibility of multiple pathogens, some respond to therapy, some not.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular congestion have both
 improved.  ET tube, upper enteric drainage tube, are in standard placements. 
 Transvenous right ventricular and left ventricular pacer leads are unchanged
 in their respective positions.  I do not see an atrial lead.  Small pleural
 effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
