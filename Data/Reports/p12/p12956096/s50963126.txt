                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD (s/p LRRT), with CKD-IV, here with R
 shoulder septic arthritis. Initially no respiratory symptoms, despite GGOs
 demonstrated on CT chest, though now with mild hypoxia (___% on RA) and cough.
 Initially on vanc/CTX, then mono-CTX, now PO cefpodoxime.  // Eval for new
 infiltrate, volume overload?   Eval for new infiltrate, volume overload?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a substantial increase
 in asymmetric pulmonary edema, more prominent on the right.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is consistent with developing effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 This in the appropriate clinical setting, given the extensive pulmonary
 changes.
 The left IJ catheter extends to the lower SVC.
