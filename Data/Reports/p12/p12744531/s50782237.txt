                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes.  
 Blunting of the costophrenic sulci suggests tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
 The lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
