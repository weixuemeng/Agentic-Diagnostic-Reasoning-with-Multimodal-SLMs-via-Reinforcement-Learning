                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, hypotension, increased right knee pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted, slightly
 improved in the interval.  Previously noted patchy ill-defined opacities
 within both lungs appear somewhat improved, likely reflective of resolving
 infection.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Severe multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in appearance of ill-defined multifocal opacities likely
 reflective of resolving infection.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, also
 improved from the prior study.
