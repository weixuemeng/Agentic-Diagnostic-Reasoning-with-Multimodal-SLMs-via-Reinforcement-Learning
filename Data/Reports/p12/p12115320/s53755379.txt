                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a retrocardiac opacity which
 corresponds to an area of increased opacity over the spine on the lateral
 view.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Bones are intact.  No
 pleural effusions are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity most likely due to
 atelectasis, but pneumonia can not be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
