                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of coronary artery disease, hypertension,
 hyperlipidemia, here with recurrent chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy
 medial right lung base opacity, more prominent than on the prior study, most
 likely relates to underlying vascular structures; however, an underlying
 evolving consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the aorta calcified and
 tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial right lung base opacity, more prominent compared to
 the prior study, most likely represents confluence of vascular structures;
 however, an evolving consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
