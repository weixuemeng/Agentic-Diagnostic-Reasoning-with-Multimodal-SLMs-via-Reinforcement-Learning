                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and new right IJ catheter, here to evaluate catheter
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is seen with the
 tip terminating in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  In comparison
 to the most recent prior study, there is slightly increased opacification at
 the left lung base with blunting at the left costophrenic angle likely
 reflecting a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Streaky
 opacification at the right lung base medially most likely reflects
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits with calcification of the aortic knob and
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present without overt pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes are noted in the
 spine.  Two orthopedic screws are imaged in the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly increased opacification at the left lung base from ___ likely
 reflects a combination pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in upper SVC.
