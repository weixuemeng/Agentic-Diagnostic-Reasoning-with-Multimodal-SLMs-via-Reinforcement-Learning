                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hematemesis, intubated.  Assess tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph of the chest approximately six hours prior on
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube tip projects approximately 8 cm above the level of the
 carina.  A newly placed internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at
 the level of the mid SVC.  Lung volumes are low bilaterally.  The right
 hemidiaphragm and minor fissure are elevated and there is complete
 opacification of the right upper lobe suggesting complete collapse.  The
 mediastinal structures are shifted rightward due to the collapse.  This shift
 results in the marked rightward deviation of the trachea.  Additionally,
 patchy and linear sublobar atelectasis is noted.   There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax evident on this single supine frontal radiograph but
 these cannot be ruled out.  Mild gastric dissension is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminates 8 cm above the carina and may be advanced 3 cm for
 optimal placement.
 
 2.  Complete right upper lobe collapse, likely due to mucous plugging.
 
 3.  New IJ catheter likely terminates in SVC, but assessment of the catheter
 and adjacent mediastinal contours is difficult due to coexisting right upper
 lobe collapse. Follow up CXR will be helpful following resolution of collapse
 to allow better assessment of the catheter and adjacent mediastinal contours.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at
 3:45 p.m. on ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
