                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Liver failure.
 
 CHEST 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 Diffuse interstitial alveolar opacities are seen distributed evenly throughout
 the lungs.  In view of the patient's clinical condition, this probably
 represents edema even though the cardiac size is not markedly increased and I
 do not see free fluid.  A diffuse viral or bacterial infection could also give
 this appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrate.
