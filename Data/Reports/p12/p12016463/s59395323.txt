 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip courses below the diaphragm with side ports at the

 been a slight interval increase in pulmonary vascular engorgement and
 bilateral pulmonary edema.  Otherwise, the hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged. There is a new focal consolidation in the left lingula concerning
 for infection. There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the side-ports in the distal
 esophagus. This must be advanced.
 
 2.  Interval increase in bilateral pulmonary edema with a focal interval
 increase in opacification at the left lingula, likely secondary to atelectasis
 or infection.
