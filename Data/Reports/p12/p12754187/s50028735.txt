 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, increasing )2 requirement  //
 interval change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains at
 the upper limits of normal in size. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification
 at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm most likely reflect
 pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lobes. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
