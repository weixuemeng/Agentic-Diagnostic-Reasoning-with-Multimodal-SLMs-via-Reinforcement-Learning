  The left pleural effusion is not significantly changed since study performed 1
  day prior.  Likely small right pleural effusion is also present.  There is
  persistent bibasilar reticular opacities, which could reflect worsening of
  chronic interstitial lung disease versus superimposed infection.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion, appears larger on stress MIBI  //
 Assess for effusion progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Triple lead right-sided pacer device is stable in position.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  When compared to the most recent prior examination
 stable bilateral pleural effusions with basal opacities, are superimposed on
 background lower lobe predominant fibrosis.  There is mild vascular congestion
 PE
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basal predominant fibrosis with superimposed small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The superimposed basal airspace opacities can represent dependent
 edema due to congestive heart failure or infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
