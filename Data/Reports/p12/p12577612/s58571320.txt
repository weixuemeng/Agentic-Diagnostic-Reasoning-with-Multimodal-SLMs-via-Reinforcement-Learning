                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // r/o chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest wall pacemaker generator is in unchanged position.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy with wires intact.  Surgical clips project
 over the pericardium.  Extensive pulmonary fibrosis with basilar predominance
 and apparent honeycombing is again seen, however lung opacities at the right
 lung base are subtly increased in comparison to multiple prior examinations.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtly increased opacities at the right lung base could potentially represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, but are difficult to
 differentiate from conglomerate fibrosis.  If clinically indicated a CT may be
 useful for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 7:59 AM, 15 minutes after discovery of the findings.
