                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, here to evaluate for interval changes.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with volume loss in the right
 hemi thorax and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged from the most
 recent prior study.  A small to moderate right pleural effusion is increased
 from ___.  Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe and
 opacification of the medial right lung apex is unchanged and likely represents
 postsurgical appearance.  The left lung is relatively clear without pleural
 effusion or focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged with slight unfolding and mild tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  The trachea remains deviated to the right related to
 volume loss in the right hemi thorax.  A 20 mm calcification projecting over
 the right lower neck may correspond to vascular calcifications.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased small to moderate right pleural effusion from ___.  
 
 2.  Status post right upper lobectomy with volume loss in the right hemi
 thorax, similar in appearance to ___.
