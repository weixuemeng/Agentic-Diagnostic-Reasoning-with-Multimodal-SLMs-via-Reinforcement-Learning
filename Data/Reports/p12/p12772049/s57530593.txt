 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from six hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  There has been no
 change from prior exam with right basilar opacity which could reflect, in
 part, an elevated right hemidiaphragm, though effusion and consolidation are
 also a concern.  There has been no progression from prior.
