                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis, here to
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 12:08 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right pleural effusion is decreased in size status post
 thoracentesis with residual small amount of pleural fluid still obscuring the
 right hemidiaphragm.  There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Opacification at the right lung apex and volume loss in the right hemithorax
 is unchanged and represents stable postoperative appearance.  The left lung is
 relatively clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis with residual
 small effusion.
 
 2.  No definitive evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Otherwise, stable appearance of the chest.
