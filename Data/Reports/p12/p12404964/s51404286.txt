                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___ year old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There is blunting
 of bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left, consistent with
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Overlying atelectasis is seen.  Additionally,
 there is an area of ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung which could be
 due to consolidation but the cardiac silhouette is difficult to optimally
 assess due to bilateral pleural effusion, appears top normal.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.
 2.  Additional ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung could be due to
 consolidation from infection and/or aspiration.
