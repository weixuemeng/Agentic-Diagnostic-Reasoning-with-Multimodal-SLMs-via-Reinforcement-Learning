                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation.  Reevaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are unchanged.  Due to
 positioning, the effusions are layered posteriorly.  The previously seen
 opacification in the right mid lung is obscured by the layered effusion. 
 There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  Calcification of the aortic arch
 and descending aorta are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate bilateral effusions.
 2.  No significant change from prior radiograph.
