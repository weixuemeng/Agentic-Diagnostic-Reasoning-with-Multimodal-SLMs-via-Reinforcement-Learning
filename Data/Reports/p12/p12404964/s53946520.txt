                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, chest pain  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary artery is
 enlarged suggesting pulmonary hypertension. The lungs are hyperinflated
 consistent with emphysema.  Opacities involving the bilateral lower lobes and
 within the right middle lobe could represents infection and are best
 appreciated on the lateral view.  A focal rounded opacity in the left mid lung
 is seen.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe and right middle lobe opacities are worrisome for
 atypical infection.  Hyperinflated lungs consistent with emphysema.
 
 Focal rounded opacity projected over the left mid lung is possibly due to a
 nipple shadow but not fully characterized.
 
 Recommend followup chest x-ray in 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic
 therapy to assess for resolution of multifocal opacities suggestive of
 pneumonia. Placement of nipple markers on the followup exam will also help
 localize the left mid lung nodular opacity.
