                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___ and ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear, without focal
 consolidation.  There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions, likely
 decreased from prior study.  Heart size is difficult to interpret, but appears
 unchanged from prior study.  Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch
 and descending thoracic aorta.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral, small-to-moderate pleural effusions, slightly
 decreased from prior, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
