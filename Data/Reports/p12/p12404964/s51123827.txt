                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent admission for PNA  presenting with
 nausea and dry heaving . Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been improvement in the nodular
 heterogeneous opacities bilaterally, with still some mild residual airspace
 disease in the regions of prior, more distinct consolidation.  The nodular
 opacity in the left midlung is no longer well appreciated, and was likely due
 to prior infection. Lungs are hyperinflated compatible with COPD.  Heart size
 is normal. Again noted is an enlarged main pulmonary artery, which may
 indicate pulmonary hypertension. Calcification of the aortic knob is again
 noted. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild biapical scarring is
 redemonstrated.
 The lateral view demonstrates lower thoracic spine compression fractures,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improvement in bilateral airspace opacity since the prior radiograph, with
 a small amount of residual airspace disease.
 2.  COPD
 3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery, possibly indicative of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 4. Unchanged thoracic spine compression fractures.
