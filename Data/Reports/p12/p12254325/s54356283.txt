                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decompensated CHF  // eval for interval
 change in pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  Probably overall not a significant interval change
 when accounting for differences in patient position and imaging technique. 
 Slightly hazy opacification of the lower lungs bilaterally is likely secondary
 to dependent small pleural effusions on this semi erect film.  Moderate to
 severe cardiomegaly persists and is overall unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is probably also overall unchanged.  Pulmonary edema is minimal if
 any, and likely dependent if present.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
