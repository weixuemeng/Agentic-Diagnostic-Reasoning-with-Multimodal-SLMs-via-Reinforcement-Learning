                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, hypoxic  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated. There is persistent to slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace pleural effusion and or
 pleural thickening/ atelectasis. There is subtle diffuse increase in
 interstitial opacity bilaterally which could be due to mild fluid overload
 versus atypical infection. No lobar consolidation is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Aorta remains calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with evidence of pulmonary emphysema again seen.  Increase
 in interstitial markings bilaterally could be due to superimposed fluid
 overload versus atypical infection.
