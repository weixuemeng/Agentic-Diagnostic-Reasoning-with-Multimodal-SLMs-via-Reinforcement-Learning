                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia, assessment for pulmonary edema.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Tortuous aorta is re-demonstrated. 
 Lungs are substantially hyperinflated with distortion of the parenchyma, most
 likely consistent with emphysema and potentially COPD.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  There is a small amount of pleural effusion suspected,
 although it might represent just flattening of the hemidiaphragm.  Overall as
 compared to the prior study, no definitive change demonstrated.  If clinically
 warranted, correlation with chest CT for precise assessment of severity of
 emphysema may be considered.
