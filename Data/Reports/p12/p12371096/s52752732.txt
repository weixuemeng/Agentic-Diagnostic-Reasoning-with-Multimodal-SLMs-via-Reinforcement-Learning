                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, thought secondary to asthma.  Evaluate for possible
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion are chronic, but
 there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Peribronchial opacification
 in the right lower lobe is more likely atelectasis than infection.
 
 Thoracic aorta is very tortuous, but not focally dilated, and unchanged.
