                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with bilateral lower
 extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta demonstrates aortic
 arch calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 previous pattern of mild pulmonary edema has nearly resolved.  Persistent
 opacification in the left lung base likely reflects a combination of moderate
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, not significantly changed from the
 prior exam.  There are no new areas of focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  Degenerative changes of the left humeral head are noted. 
 Compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in previous pattern of mild pulmonary edema.  Persistent
 moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis in the left lung base.
