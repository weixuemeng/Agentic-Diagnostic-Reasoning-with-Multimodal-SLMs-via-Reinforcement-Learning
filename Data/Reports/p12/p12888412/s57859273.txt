                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.  Evaluate for fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Indistinct pulmonary vasculature and prominent interstitial
 opacities are compatible with vascular congestion.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is compatible with adjacent atelectasis, although infection is not
 excluded.  Wedge compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction is similar to the prior exam.  Chronic deformity of the
 left humeral head is stable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small left pleural
 effusion and retrocardiac opacity which likely represents atelectasis.
