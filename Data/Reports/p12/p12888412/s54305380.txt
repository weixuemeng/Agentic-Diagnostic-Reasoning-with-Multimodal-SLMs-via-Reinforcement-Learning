                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal and epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The aorta shows
 calcifications along the arch.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 similar.  There is increased indistinctness of vascularity and slightly
 prominent interstitial opacities suggesting mild vascular congestion.  In
 addition, there is a possible small left-sided pleural effusion based on
 blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus on the frontal view.  A patchy new
 medial left retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe which may reflect
 pneumonia or potentially atelectasis.  Moderate-to-severe thoracolumbar
 compression deformity appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity for which atelectasis could be considered as
 the etiology, but pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 3.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
