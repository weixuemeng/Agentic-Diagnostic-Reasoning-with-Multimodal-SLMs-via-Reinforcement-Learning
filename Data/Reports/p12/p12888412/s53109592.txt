                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lethargy and recent pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Enlarging
 left lower lobe opacity without shift of the mediastinum is consistent with
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The right lung is essentially clear with
 minimal right lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema has slightly
 worsened.  No pneumothorax.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A
 compression deformity of a lower thoracic spine vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left lower lobe opacity, slightly increased since ___, is
 consistent with an enlarging pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 
 2. Slightly worsened pulmonary edema.
