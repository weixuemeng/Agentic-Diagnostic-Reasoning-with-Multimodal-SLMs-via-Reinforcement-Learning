                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible achalasia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is further enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and moderate left pleural
 effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis.  Wedging deformity of the L1
 vertebral body is again seen.  To evaluate for possible achalasia, a barium
 study would be necessary.
