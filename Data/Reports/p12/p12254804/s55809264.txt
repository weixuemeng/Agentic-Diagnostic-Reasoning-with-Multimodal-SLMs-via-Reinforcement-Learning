                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with substernal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left upper lobe lung mass is again seen, better evaluated on recent
 prior CT.  Lung volumes are low.  There is decreased right paratracheal
 opacification compared to prior, likely representing decreased known
 paratracheal lymphadenopathy.  There has been interval placement of a
 Port-A-Cath with tip projecting at the level of the low superior vena cava. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is
 detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known left upper lobe lung mass and interval placement of a right
 Port-A-Cath with interval decrease in right paratracheal opacification, likely
 corresponding to known lymphadenopathy, without radiographic evidence for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
