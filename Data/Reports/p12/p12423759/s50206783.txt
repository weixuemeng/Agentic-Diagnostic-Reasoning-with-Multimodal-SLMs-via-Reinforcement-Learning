 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p chest tube, evaluate for chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new pigtail catheter projects over the right mid to lower lung.  Increased
 rightward midline shift of the trachea and mediastinum suggests interval
 decrease in the size of a large right pleural effusion causing near complete
 opacification of the right lung without compensatory re-expansion of the right
 lung.  Right upper lung aeration is slightly increased.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right chest pigtail catheter with slightly decreased right pleural
 effusion and increased right upper lung aeration.  No pneumothorax.
