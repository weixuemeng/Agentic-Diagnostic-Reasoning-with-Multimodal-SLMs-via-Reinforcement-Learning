                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with liver disease, here with fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is grossly normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small to moderate size
 right pleural effusion is noted, likely with a subpulmonic component, along
 with atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  Fluid appears to track into the
 minor fissure.  More focal opacity within the inferior right upper lobe
 medially may reflect an area of infection.  Small left pleural effusion is
 also noted.  Left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate size right pleural effusion, likely with a subpulmonic
 component, with right lower lobe atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion. 
 Focal opacity along the inferior right upper lobe medially may reflect an area
 developing infection.  No pulmonary edema.
