                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with enterobacter empyema.  // ?interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and decrease in extent of
 pulmonary edema.  Moderate sized, partially loculated right pleural effusion
 with adjacent rounded lucencies in the right mid and lower hemithorax
 corresponds to a complex hydropneumothorax on prior chest CT of ___.  The exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent slight increase in size
 of small left pleural effusion, potentially due to positional differences.
