                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis with SOB and decreased lung sounds
 at right base  // ?edema, effusion, infection      ?edema, effusion, infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large right pleural effusion is largely dependent and posterior, but since
 there is no leftward mediastinal shift, it is accompanied by an equivalent
 volume of atelectasis in the right lower lobe, suggesting it is not acute. 
 The large elliptical opacity crossing the right mid hemi thorax is either
 fluid in the depressed right major fissure or fluid in the fissure and
 consolidation sitting above it in the posterior segment of the right upper
 lobe.  Unfortunately I cannot make that distinction on plain radiographs
 alone, but it is quite possible that the primary and only significant
 abnormality in the right hemi thorax is new pleural effusion.
 
 Left lung is clear.  Heart is normal size.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ (In Hospital,
 On Page), ___ by telephone on ___ at 3:59 PM, 1 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
