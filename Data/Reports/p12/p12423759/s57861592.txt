 dobhoff      placement of dobhoff
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 Dobhoff tube with the opaque portion in in the upper stomach.  The tube could
 be pushed further approximately 5-10 cm for better positioning.
 The opacification at the right base is less prominent than on the previous
 study.  This could reflect decreasing pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis, though it may merely be a manifestation of a more upright
 position of patient.  No evidence of appreciable vascular congestion or acute
 focal pneumonia.
