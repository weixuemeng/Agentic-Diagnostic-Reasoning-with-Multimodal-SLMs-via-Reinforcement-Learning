 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, assess for effusion
 atelectasis.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:51.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 16:03 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  Calcification of the aorta consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar
 air-space disease, left greater than the right, consistent with compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral calcifications within the neck soft tissues, which may be
 carotid in etiology.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Clips in the right
 upper quadrant consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
