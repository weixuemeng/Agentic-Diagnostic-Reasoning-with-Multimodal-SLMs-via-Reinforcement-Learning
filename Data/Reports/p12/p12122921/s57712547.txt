                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with temporary pacing wire  // evaluate for lead
 placement and pneumothorax      evaluate for lead placement and pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through comparison:  Chest
 radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have probably increased since ___, responsible for greater atelectasis at the lung bases, and obscuring the
 left heart border.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is probably
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged,
 but I see little evidence of pulmonary edema.  Right jugular temporary pacer
 lead passes as far as the floor of the proximal right ventricle.  No
 pneumothorax.
