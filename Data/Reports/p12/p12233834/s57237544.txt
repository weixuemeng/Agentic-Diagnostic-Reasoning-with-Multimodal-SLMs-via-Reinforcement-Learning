                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic spine.  Along the
 right lower lateral chest wall, there is convex pleural thickening measuring
 up to 25 mm as measured on the frontal radiograph.  This appearance raises
 concern for a pleural-based mass, although it may reflect loculated effusion
 or area of scarring.  Comparison to prior radiographs would be helpful and
 particularly if long-term documentation of stability of this appearance is not
 possible, chest CT, preferably with intravenous contrast is suggested to
 assess further.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  
 
 2.  Substantial focal right lateral pleural thickening; differential
 considerations include both benign and malignant processes.  Correlation to
 prior radiographs is recommended if available.  Particularly if long-term
 stability of this appearance cannot be established by comparison to prior
 imaging then chest CT is recommended to assess further when clinically
 appropriate.
