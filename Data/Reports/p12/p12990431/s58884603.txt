                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o melanoma p/w stridor secondary to cyst
 on right vocal cord now s/p tracheostomy  // Evaluate for change in pulmonary
 edema, cardiomegaly
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 Low lung volumes are again present.  Again seen is a tracheostomy tube, with
 considerable prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular
 plethora.  Possibility of pericardial effusion has been previously raised. 
 Probable increased retrocardiac density, similar to the prior film, though
 this is likely accentuated by underpenetration.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with 1 day earlier.
