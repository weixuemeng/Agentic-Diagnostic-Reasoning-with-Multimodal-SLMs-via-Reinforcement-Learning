                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TBBx  // r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  This may obscure small apical pneumothorax.  Allowing
 for this, no pneumothorax is detected.  Again seen are the opacities in the
 superolateral portions of both the right and left upper lungs, right larger
 than left.  Differences in appearance compared to the conventional frontal
 view from ___ may be partially accounted for by the considerable
 differences in positioning.  Ill definition of the right upper zone mass could
 also represent postprocedural change.
 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear.  No CHF or effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  Please note that given the extreme apical lordotic
 position, a small pneumothorax might not be apparent.
