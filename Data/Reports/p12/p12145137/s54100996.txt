                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with history of altered mental status,
 febrile, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest is obtained.  Previously seen left
 juxtahilar opacity lateral to the fiducial seeds has decreased in size and
 persists since the prior study.  No new focal consolidation is seen.There is
 prominence of the right hilum which is slightly increased since the prior
 study, which may relate to patient positioning, although underlying increased
 lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  A left subclavian central venous catheter
 is again seen, unchanged in position.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Chronic right chest wall deformity again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left suprahilar opacity and fiducial seeds are again seen, although
 appears slightly less prominent/small in size, although as mentioned on the
 prior study, could be further evaluated by chest CT or PET-CT.
 2.  Right hilum appears slightly more prominent as compared to the prior
 study, which may be due to patient positioning, although increased right hilar
 lymphadenopathy is not excluded.
