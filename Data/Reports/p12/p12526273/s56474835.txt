 INDICATION:  ___ yo with schizophrenia, COPD d/c on O2, HTN, and T2DM with lung
 mass concerning for malignancy, lytic hip lesion, mediastinal adenopathy,

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.  CT chest
 dated ___.

 The left pigtail drain has since been removed.  Left lung edema is slightly
 less. Otherwise, no overall significant change in the radiographic appearance
 of the lungs since ___.  Overall similar appearance of the left upper lung
 opacity that corresponds to a mass on CT with adjacent atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.  Persistent and overall similar probable small left pleural
 effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis.  No right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  Widening of the mediastinum
 probably corresponds to enlarged nodes on CT.
