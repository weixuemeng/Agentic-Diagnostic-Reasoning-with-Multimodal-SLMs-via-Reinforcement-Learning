  1. Large left perihilar mass causing mass effect on the trachea and rightward
  deviation. This was better characterized on outside CT chest performed on ___. Opacity in the left upper lobe is likely due to postobstructive
  pneumonia.
  
  2. Consolidation at the left lung base with air bronchograms as well as the
  right lung base concerning for multi focal pneumonia.
  
  3. Moderate left pleural effusion with mild pulmonary edema.
