                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The left upper
 superior contour of the heart is mildly prominent which may suggest
 enlargement of the left atrial appendage.  The possibility of left atrial
 enlargement is also suggested by the lateral view, where the heart closely
 approaches the spine posteriorly.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline cardiomegaly with suggestion of possible left atrial
 enlargement, but no evidence of acute disease.
