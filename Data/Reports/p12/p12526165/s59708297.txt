                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been
 removed.  Patient has taken a much better inspiration, which may account for
 much of the apparent clearing of the bibasilar areas of opacification. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with some atelectatic changes and
 probable mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
