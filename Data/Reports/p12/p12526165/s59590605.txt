                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post CABG, now with increasing abdominal girth.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Significant interval improvement in aeration in the right upper lobe with
 near-complete resolution of the right upper lobe collapse.  More focal patchy
 opacity in the left mid lung remains suggestive of atelectasis.  The
 pneumopericardium is stable.  Stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours status post median sternotomy.  There continues to be a relative
 hyperlucency in the left costophrenic sulcus, which could reflect an anterior
 pneumothorax.  Followup imaging in the upright or decubitus position would be
 advised.  Interval resolution of mild pulmonary edema.  No large effusions. 
 Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal
 drains and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
