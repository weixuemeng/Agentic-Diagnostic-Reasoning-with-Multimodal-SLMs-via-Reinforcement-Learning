                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 1:___ ___ ___
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma.  Dislodged central line.  Check placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Left subclavian line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Decreasing
 caliber of the upper mediastinum is presumably reflection of more upright
 positioning and better lung volumes but may also reflect decrease in diffuse
 mediastinal edema seen on the recent chest CT scan.
 
 There is, however, new heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases,
 particularly the right, similar but not as severe as that present on ___,
 when the heart was larger and the mediastinum wider.  I think this is
 transient pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.
