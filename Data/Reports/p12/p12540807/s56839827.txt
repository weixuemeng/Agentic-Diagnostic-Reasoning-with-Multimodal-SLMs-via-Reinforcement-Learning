                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple myeloma, preoperative
 chest examination for bone marrow transplant.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened but otherwise
 unremarkable.  No evidence of local contour abnormalities and no wall
 calcifications are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 There is a slightly peripheral irregular vascular distribution to pulmonary
 circulation and some increased translucencies in the lung bases coinciding
 with relatively low-positioned diaphragms suggesting the possibility of COPD. 
 Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be identified.  The lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulations.  Apical area
 unremarkable on frontal view and no evidence of pneumothorax.  Skeletal
 structures are also grossly within normal limits and no evidence of any
 vertebral body deformity in the thoracic spine as seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No acute infiltrates or CHF in this
 ___-year-old male patient to undergo bone marrow transplant.
