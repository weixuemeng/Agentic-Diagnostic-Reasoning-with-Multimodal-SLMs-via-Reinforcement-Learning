                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent L4-5 TLIF on ___ presenting
 with fevers and back pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 There are increased opacities identified on the lateral view at the lung bases
 without definite consolidation identified on the frontal view.  There is also
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles.  Linear opacity at the left
 lung base.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Multiple old right rib fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the lung bases, better seen on the lateral
 view, potentially due to atelectasis; however, developing infiltrates could
 also be considered.
