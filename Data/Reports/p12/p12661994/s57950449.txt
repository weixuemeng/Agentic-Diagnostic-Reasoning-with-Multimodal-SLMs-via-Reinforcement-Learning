 It is difficult to tell whether in addition to the markedly elevated right
 lung base is also right lower lobe collapse.  The remaining 4 lobes are well
 aerated.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and moderate
 cardiomegaly is minimally smaller.  Mediastinal veins are still distended.
 
 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to the thoracic inlet, no less than 8 cm
 from the carina and should be advanced 3 cm for more secure positioning. 
 Right internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.  Esophageal
 drainage tube can be traced only as far as the low esophagus but the tip is
 indistinct.
 
 No appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
