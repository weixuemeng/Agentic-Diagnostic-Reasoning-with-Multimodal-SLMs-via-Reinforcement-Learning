                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 diffuse opacification of the right lung that could reflect hemorrhage or
 aspiration.  The nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole
 remains above the esophagogastric junction.  The tube should be pushed forward
 at least 5 cm.  Mild interstitial opacities persist in the left lung.
