 An enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip below the
 level of the hemidiaphragm in the anticipated location of the distal stomach.
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter is noted in unchanged
 position, its tip which projects at or just below the anticipated location of
 the cavoatrial junction.  A left chest pacer is present, its leads which
 appear intact and in stable configuration.  Previously present endotracheal
