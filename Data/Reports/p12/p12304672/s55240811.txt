                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is again noted with leads terminating in
 unchanged positions in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiac
 silhouette size remains within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, and pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Small left
 pleural effusion and patchy opacity in the left lung base are similar, and the
 right lung remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Minimal degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar-appearing small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis
 or scarring.  No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
