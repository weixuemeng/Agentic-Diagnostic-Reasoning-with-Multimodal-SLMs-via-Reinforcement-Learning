                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DOE of one month duration  // please rule
 out parenchymal etiology
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT abdomen of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aorta is mildly tortuous without change.  Left-sided
 pleural opacity appears similar to the prior exam with associated volume loss
 in the left hemi thorax and minor areas of adjacent parenchymal scarring in
 the left mid and lower lung.  This appears to be due to a combination of
 pleural thickening and pleural effusion based on CT abdomen of ___. 
 Right lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear.  Small right pleural effusion
 is also demonstrated and is similar to ___ radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Probable left fibrothorax with chronic left pleural thickening, loculated
 fluid, and volume loss.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
