                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath for 3 days status post hemicolectomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip is now located within the distal left brachiocephalic vein, a
 change in position compared to the prior study.  Previously noted enteric tube
 has been removed. Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the
 cardiac silhouette which is at least mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour
 is also some similarly widened due to low lung volumes but otherwise
 unremarkable. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated. Linear and patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PICC tip now terminates within the proximal left brachiocephalic vein
 and should be repositioned.
 2. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis. Pneumonia, however,
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
