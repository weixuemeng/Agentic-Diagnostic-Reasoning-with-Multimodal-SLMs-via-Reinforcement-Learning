 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p open colectomy s/p NGT placement  // NGT
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 18:17
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 3 images of the torso were submitted.  The first is centered below the
 diaphragm and excludes the apex of the chest. It shows an esophageal tube
 ending in the low esophagus just above the level of the diaphragm. The second
 is essentially unchanged. The third, shows the entire chest, and the
 nasogastric tube withdrawn to the junction of the middle and lower third of
 the esophagus. Since earlier in the day, mild interstitial edema has cleared.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Lung volumes remain very low, accounting for
 moderately severe atelectasis at the base the right lung. Thoracic aorta is
 generally large, but not recently changed. Upper lungs are clear aside from
 mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax. Recent abdominal CT shows small
 hiatus hernia, which may account for difficulty in passing the nasogastric
 tube into the stomach.
