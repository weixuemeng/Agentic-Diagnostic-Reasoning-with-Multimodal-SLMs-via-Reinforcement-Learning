                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of cough who presents for
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small new opacification at the left costophrenic angle
 which could be secondary to a new small left pleural effusion; however, an
 infectious process cannot be ruled out.  No other focal consolidations are
 seen.  The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The left
 transverse pacemaker leads end in the right atrium and right ventricles,
 respectively.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left base opacification likely secondary to pneumonia.  
 
 Recommend treatment with antibiotics and repeat radiographs after treatment to
 assess for resolution.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at ___:___pm by Dr. ___ by
 telephone on the day of the exam.
