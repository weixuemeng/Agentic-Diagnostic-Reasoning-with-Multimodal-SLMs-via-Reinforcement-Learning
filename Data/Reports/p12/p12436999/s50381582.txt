                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided pneumothorax, evaluate after a
 pigtail catheter placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph performed ___ at 08:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed earlier in the same hour, there has been
 interval placement of a right sided pigtail catheter with resulting
 re-expansion of the right lung.  No evidence of residual pneumothorax.  There
 may be a small pleural effusion on the right.  No substantial left pleural
 effusion.  Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities remain evident, more
 prominent on the left, which could be seen in the setting of chronic lung
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval re-expansion of the right lung status post pigtail catheter
 placement.  No evidence of residual pneumothorax.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
