                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IN O.R.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest, ARDS  // Eval for
 improvement?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, support and monitoring
 devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable. Interval slight improvement in bibasilar opacities and apparent slight
 decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions with residual small left and
 moderate right effusion remaining. Apparent cavity in right mid lung is newly
 appreciated at the site of previous loculated pleural fluid. It is uncertain
 whether this represents loculated gas within the pleural space, a developing
 abscess, or simulation of a cavity. Left lateral decubitus radiograph with
 attention to the right lung may be helpful for initial further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 9:29 AM, ___ min after the time of the discovery
