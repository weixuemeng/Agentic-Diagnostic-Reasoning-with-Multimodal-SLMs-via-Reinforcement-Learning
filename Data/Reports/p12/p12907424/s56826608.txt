                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increasing wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 3 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  The
 right hemidiaphragm is now somewhat obscured with new vague opacification
 projecting over the right lower lung but sparing the right cardiac border. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Developing vague opacity at the right lung base suggesting atelectasis,
 aspiration, or possibly pneumonia, involving a portion of the right lower
 lobe.  Short-term follow-up radiographs are suggested.
