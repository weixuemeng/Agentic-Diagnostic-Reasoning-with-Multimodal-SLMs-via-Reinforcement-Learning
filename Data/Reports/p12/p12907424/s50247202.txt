                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest, now with pulse
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limit assessment. The heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild upper zone
 pulmonary vascular redistribution likely due to supine positioning without
 overt pulmonary edema. Minimal patchy opacities are noted in the upper lobes
 as well as the lower lobes bilaterally, which could reflect atelectasis or
 aspiration. Assessment of the left costophrenic angle is limited as it is
 excluded from the field of view. However, no large focal consolidation, gross
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No
 displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Standard position of endotracheal tube.
 2. Patchy opacities in the upper and lower lobes bilaterally, potentially
 atelectasis but aspiration is not excluded.
