 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New from prior exams is consolidation at the lateral aspect of the left long. 
 Subpleural reticular opacities were better seen on prior chest CT. Known
 pleural-based density in the left lower lobe is seen on the lateral view is a
 spiculated density projecting over the lower thoracic pedicles.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  The right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the lateral left lung compatible with pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:   Followup will be necessary to document resolution.
 Specifically, CT scan should be considered for given prior recommendation for
