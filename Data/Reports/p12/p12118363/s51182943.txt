                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiographs, the pulmonary vasculature markings are
 more indistinct, with mild cardiomegaly and ___ B-lines.  A right basilar
 opacification is likely due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and atelectasis, but
 a concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires are intact, and multiple mediastinal
 surgical clips are unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval development of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Right basilar opacification is likely due to asymmetric pulmonary edema
 and atelectasis.  However, a concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
