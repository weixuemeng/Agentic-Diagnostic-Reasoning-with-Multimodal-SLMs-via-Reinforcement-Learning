                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock, evaluate for ET tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 00:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the ET tube is located approximately 6.7 cm above the carina just
 at the thoracic inlet.  The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter appears to extend
 just beyond the right descending pulmonary artery at the level of the right
 middle lobe pulmonary artery.  The tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump
 appears high, likely at the level of the aortic arch.  A nasogastric tube is
 present but its tip courses out of the field of view of exam.
 
 There are severe bilateral patchy opacities compatible with pulmonary edema. 
 The mediastinal veins are distended compatible with cardiogenic shock.  There
 are likely bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Tip of the ET tube terminating 6.7 cm above the carina just at the
 thoracic inlet.
 
 2.  High position of the IABP with tip at the aortic arch and should be pulled
 back by 2-3cm for more standard position.
 
 3.  Severe bilateral pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed with CCU resident by Dr.___ ___ phone
 at 11am on ___, 5 minutes following discovery.
