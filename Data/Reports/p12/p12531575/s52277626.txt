                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with tender left lower ribs
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes limits
 assessment. There is mild left basal atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear without evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No displaced rib
 fractures are seen. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild left basal atelectasis, otherwise normal. If there is strong clinical
 concern for rib fracture dedicated rib series may be obtained.
