                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. CTA chest ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multiple median sternotomy wires.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable, reflective of a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Eventration of
 the right hemidiaphragm is stable.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  A compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body
 with acute kyphotic angulation at that level is unchanged.  Lumbar spine
 fixation hardware with rods and transpedicular screws are noted, partially
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
