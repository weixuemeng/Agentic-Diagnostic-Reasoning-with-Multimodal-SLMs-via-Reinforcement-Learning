                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobectomy.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is redemonstration of a small right apical pneumothorax,
 minimally decreased in size compared to the prior study from ___.  A right pleural catheter is again noted.  There is minimal right
 basilar atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Left apical pleural
 thickening is unchanged.  A small right pleural effusion is new.  Mild
 subcutaneous air along the right lateral chest wall is new, possibly related
 to pleural catheter repositioning.  There is also mild subcutaneous air along
 the right lower cervical region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight decrease in size of small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  New right chest wall and lower cervical subcutaneous air, likely due to
 repositioning of the right-sided pleural catheter.  If no repositioning has
 been performed, the new subcuntaneous air would be concerning for an air leak.
