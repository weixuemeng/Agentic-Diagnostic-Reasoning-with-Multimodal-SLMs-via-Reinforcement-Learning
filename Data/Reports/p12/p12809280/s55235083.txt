                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with pancytopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 On the frontal view, lungs are fully expanded and clear.  
 
 On the lateral view, a 2.3 cm oval opacity projecting over the cardiac apex
 just superior to the anterior pleural recesses cannot be localized
 anatomically.  This could be a small lung lesion, even though not visible on
 the frontal radiograph, I would recommend routine oblique views for better
 characterization.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal.
 
 Findings were posted to the online record of critical radiology findings for
 direct notification of the referring physician.
