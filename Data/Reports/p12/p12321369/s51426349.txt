                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Fullness of the
 aortopulmonary window that may reflect enlargement of the main pulmonary
 artery and possibly lymphs, but not significantly changed.  Bilateral
 bilateral hilar prominence appears unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and
 hilar contours appear stable.  There is mild upper zone redistribution of
 pulmonary vascularity without frank interstitial edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary venous hypertension without
 frank pulmonary edema.  Stable prominent mediastinal and hilar contours which
 may reflect mild residual lymphadenopathy, enlargement of central pulmonary
 arteries, or perhaps both.
