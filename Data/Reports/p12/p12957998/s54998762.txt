                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 increased interstitial markings in the mid-to-lower lung fields bilaterally,
 which could relate to fluid overload, although given question of pneumonia, a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally in mid to lower lung
 fields could relate to fluid overload, although given question of pneumonia,
 infectious process is not excluded.
