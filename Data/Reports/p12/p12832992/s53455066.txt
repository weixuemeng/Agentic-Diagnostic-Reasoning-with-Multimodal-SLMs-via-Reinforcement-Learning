                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rising white blood count.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours remain
 within normal limits.  There is central vascular engorgement, without overt
 edema. Since ___ there is slight left volume loss with increased
 left retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, though small
 consolidation at the left base cannot be excluded. Moderate calcifications are
 again seen throughout the aortic arch.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.  A trace left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis appears worse since ___. Small
 consolidation in this region cannot be excluded. Trace left pleural effusion
 is unchanged.
