                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarge.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Slight
 prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to mild
 interstitial edema.  There is severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body.  There is mild anterior wedging of an additional vertebral body two
 levels lower than the aforementioned compressed vertebral body.  Additionally,
 there is moderate compression of a thoracic vertebral body at the level of the
 diaphragm.  No prior studies available for comparison to assess for acuity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible minimal interstitial edema.
 2.  Compression of at least three thoracic vertebral bodies, one in the mid
 thoracic region is severely compressed; no prior studies available for
 comparison.  To best assess for acuity, recommend clinical correlation and
 additional imaging as clinically warranted.
