                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall with bilateral chest wall pain. 
 Assess for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained for
 evaluation of cough and congestion.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and a markedly tortuous, calcified aorta are again seen. 
 Hilar contours are grossly stable.  There is mild linear atelectasis at the
 lateral left base.  There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 The bones are demineralized.  The ribs are underpenetrated on chest
 radiography for better visualization of the lungs.  The lower ribs are not
 penetrated, and may not be fully included on the PA view.  No obvious
 displaced rib fracture is identified.  Two lower thoracic compression
 fractures are again seen without interval change, one of which demonstrates
 evidence of vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated rib radiographs would be helpful for assessing
 the ribs, if clinically warranted.
