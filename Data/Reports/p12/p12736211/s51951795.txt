                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatitis  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular catheter is in-situ, this is been withdrawn somewhat
 compared to the prior study.  But still appears low, likely in the right
 atrium.  This could be withdrawn a further 2 cm for better positioning within
 the SVC.  Lung volumes remain low which may be contributing to this
 appearance.  Left basilar atelectasis has progressed slightly compared to the
 prior study.  The airspace opacity seen previously is less conspicuous on the
 current study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Progressive left basilar atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
 2. The right internal jugular catheter has been withdrawn somewhat but could
 be withdrawn a further 2 cm for better positioning within the SVC.
