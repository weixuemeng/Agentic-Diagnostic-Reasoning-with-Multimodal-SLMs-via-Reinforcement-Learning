                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits, and the hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Additionally, small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
