                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  No acute
 displaced rib fractures are detected.  There is no free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No acute displaced rib fracture is detected.  If there is clinical
 concern, a dedicated rib series could be obtained with a BB marker placed over
 the site of the patient's pain.
