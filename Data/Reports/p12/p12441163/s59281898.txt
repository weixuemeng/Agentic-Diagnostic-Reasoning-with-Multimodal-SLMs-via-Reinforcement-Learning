 ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval appearance of patchy opacity at the right base which may reflect
 atelectasis, although developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical
 assessment. No evidence of pneumothorax.  Relatively low lung volumes with no
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and and mediastinal contours are
 stable. Deformity of the left sixth and seventh posterolateral ribs likely
 reflects remote trauma. No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
