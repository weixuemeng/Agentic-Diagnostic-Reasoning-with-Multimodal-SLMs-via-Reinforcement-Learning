                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with Coronary artery disease and presenting with
 cough. Evaluate for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. The opacity in the region of the left upper
 hemithorax is increased in size from the prior exam. No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Stable tortuosity of thoracic
 aorta. The leftward deviation of the trachea with associated narrowing of the
 lumen appears stable and is consistent with a thyroid goiter. Stable
 appearance of the hila.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Interval increase in the left upper hemithorax opacity, which may be
 intraparenchymal or a pleural plaque. Recommend further evaluation with a
 chest CT.
 
 3.  Stable leftward deviation of the trachea, likely from thyroid goiter. 
 When the chest CT is performed for the left upper lung opacity, this could be
 simultaneously evaluated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___, the referring provider requesting ___ wet read, on the telephone on
