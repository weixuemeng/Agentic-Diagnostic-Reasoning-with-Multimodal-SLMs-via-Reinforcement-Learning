                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated.  There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia. The previously seen small bilateral pleural effusions have
 resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 A calcified and tortuous aorta is redemonstrated.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal in size and unchanged from the prior study accounting for
 differences in technique.  The hilar structures are unremarkable.  Pleural
 thickening and pleural plaques are seen over the right upper lung,
 representing prior asbestos exposure.  Deviation of the trachea to the left is
 compatible with the known thyroid mass (suspicious for malignancy by
 cytology.)  The degree of deviation has increased since ___ but is unchanged
 from ___.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Hyperinflated lungs without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
