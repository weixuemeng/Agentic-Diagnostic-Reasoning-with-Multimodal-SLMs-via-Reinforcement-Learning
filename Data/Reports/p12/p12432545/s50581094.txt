                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and low oxygen saturation.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Leftward deviation of the upper trachea is again noted and likely
 due to a thyroid goiter, mass or vascular prominence.  There is no evidence of
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  New small bilateral
 posterior pleural effusions are present.  The aorta is ectatic, but unchanged
 from prior exam.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New bilateral small pleural effusions.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 3.  Stable leftward deviation of the trachea.  This may be due to a thyroid
 goiter, mass, or prominent vascular structures.  Would recommend a non-urgent
 CT of the chest for further evaluation.
