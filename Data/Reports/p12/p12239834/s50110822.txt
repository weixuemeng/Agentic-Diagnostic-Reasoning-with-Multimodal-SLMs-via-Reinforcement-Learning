                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with diabetes and cough and fever.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  A previous chest CT examination of ___ had
 shown very prominent mediastinal fat tissue structures surrounding the
 pericardium and widening the mediastinum, a finding which explains the poorly
 delineated cardiac contours.  Thus true cardiac enlargement is not present. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  In comparison with the next previous
 chest examination, there exists now a local parenchymal homogeneous density in
 the right lower lobe posterior segment consistent with a pneumonia.  No other
 new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  The lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acute pneumonic infiltrate in right lower lobe posterior segment.
 Followup after treatment is recommended.  Referring physician, ___. ___,
 was informed via telephone.
