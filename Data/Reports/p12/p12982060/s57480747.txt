                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  Left-sided
 dual-lead pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  A right-sided pleural
 effusion is again seen, which is likely similar in size to possibly minimally
 decreased, given differences in technique and patient position, with overlying
 atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The left lung is
 clear.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Degenerative changes are
 seen along the spine.
