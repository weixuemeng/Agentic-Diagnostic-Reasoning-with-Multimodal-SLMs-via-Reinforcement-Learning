                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and reference made to chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 mitral valve replacement.  There is a moderate-to-large right pleural
 effusion, increased since the prior study, which may be partially loculated. 
 There is overlying atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 The left lung is clear.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to adequately assess due to the right pleural
 effusion, although it appears to be persistently enlarged.  Aorta is calcified
 and tortuous.  Anchor screws are partially imaged in the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased moderate-to-large right pleural effusion which may be
 partially loculated, with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded.
