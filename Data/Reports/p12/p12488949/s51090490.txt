                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p intubation  // S/P ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:31.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip approximately
 3.0 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube seen with tip in the gastric fundus. 
 Left lung base opacity persists.  Streaky right midlung opacity is likely
 atelectasis given lower lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Cervical and lumbar fixation hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and enteric tubes as above.  Persistent left basilar opacity, potentially
 atelectasis versus infection.
