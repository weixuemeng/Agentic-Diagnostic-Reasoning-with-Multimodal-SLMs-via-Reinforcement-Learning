                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and psychosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a
 persistent posterior right lower lobe and medial left lower lobe
 opacification, although somewhat blurred on this study.  These seem to be of
 long chronicity even they are difficult to compare precisely to the prior
 study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute diease.  Probably similar reticular opacities at both lung
 bases suggesting chronic lung disease.
