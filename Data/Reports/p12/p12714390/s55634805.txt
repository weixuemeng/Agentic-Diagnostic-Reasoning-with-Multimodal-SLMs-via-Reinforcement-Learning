                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o ___ male with DM II, HTN, HLD, COPD,
 schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and alcohol use admitted with
 disorganized behavior and agitation now resolved with course complicated by
 falls and gait instability, acute component likely related to severe cervical
 disease, with coughing during mealtimes, c/f aspiration.  // Please assess for
 any evidence of aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
 With ill-defined vascularity. There is increased retrocardiac opacity. The
 prior study demonstrated increased lung markings compatible with chronic lung
 disease. The current finding suggest acute on top of chronic disease. In
 particular, the retrocardiac region has increased opacity with ill definition
 of the left hemidiaphragm
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fluid overload superimposed on chronic lung disease. An underlying infectious
 infiltrate particularly in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
