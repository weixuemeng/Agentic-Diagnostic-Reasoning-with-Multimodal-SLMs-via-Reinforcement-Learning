                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lateral view suggests a patchy posterior infrahilar opacity which is
 highly non-specific and not well demonstrated on the frontal view, although
 probably retrocardiac.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy posterior lung opacity, highly non-specific, most likely,
 retrocardiac.  Differential considerations include a variety of etiologies
 including atelectasis.
