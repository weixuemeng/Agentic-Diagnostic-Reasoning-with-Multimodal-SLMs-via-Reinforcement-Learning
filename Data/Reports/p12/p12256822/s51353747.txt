                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent chest tube leak.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to a
 prior study obtained at 8:49 a.m. the same day.
 
 Overall, the appearance of the chest is unchanged after removal of the left
 chest tube with substantial subcutaneous air noted bilaterally, potentially
 minimally smaller on the left side.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  Rib
 fractures are demonstrated.  Pneumomediastinum is suspected on the lateral
 view, although difficult to distinguish from subcutaneous air.
