                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with scooter accident with left-sided pneumothorax seen
 on CT of the same date.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single upright view of the chest demonstrates left chest tube projecting
 over medial left lung base.  Moderate-to-large left pneumothorax seen on CT of
 the same date has nearly resolved.  Subcutaneous gas in the left lateral chest
 is noted.  Comminuted fractures of the left clavicle, scapula and nondisplaced
 fractures of the right ribs are better demonstrated on CT of the same date. 
 Right lung is well expanded and is clear.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to chest CT obtained on same date, there is near-complete
 resolution of the moderate-to-large left pneumothorax following left-sided
 chest tube placement.
