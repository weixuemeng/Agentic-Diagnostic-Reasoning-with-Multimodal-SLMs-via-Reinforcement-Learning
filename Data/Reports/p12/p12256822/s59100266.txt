                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left pneumothorax status post chest tube
 placement, assess for resolution of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left basilar directed chest tube is in unchanged
 position, with extensive subcutaneous air and pneumomediastinum unchanged. 
 Multiple displaced left rib proximal left clavicle fractures are unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The lungs are otherwise clear with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema without
 pneumothorax. Please note this pattern of development of pneumomediastinum is
 atypical and clinical correlation is recommended to exclude potential
 etiologies of esophageal injury such as traumatic nasogastric tube placement
 or lung trauma due to chest tube placement.
