                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with status post motorized scooter accident with
 left-sided pneumothorax and multiple rib fractures, assess placement of chest
 tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is a new left apical chest tube. Previously positioned chest tube is in
 unchanged position, the tip is projecting in the mid lower left hemithorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is
 unchanged.  Pneumomediastinum is again noted.  Evaluation of a tiny left
 pneumothorax is limited due to the extensive subcutaneous emphysema. 
 Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis.
