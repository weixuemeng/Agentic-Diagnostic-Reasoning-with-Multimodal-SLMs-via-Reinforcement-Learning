                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in left pneumothorax after placing
 chest tube on waterseal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier the same day, ___ at 8:16
 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the thorax.  A left chest tube is
 unchanged in position and the previously seen pleural edge is no longer
 visualized, indicating resolution of the pneumothorax.  Minimally displaced
 fractures of the posterior left second and fifth ribs are once again seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion, and the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Right middle lobe atelectasis persists, but the lungs are otherwise
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax or recurrent effusion following placement of
 chest tube on waterseal.
 2.  Persistent extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
 3.  Persistent right middle lobe atelectasis.
 4.  Stable minimally displaced fractures of the posterior second and fifth
 ribs on the left.
