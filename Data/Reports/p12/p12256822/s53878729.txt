                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pneumothorax
 after chest tube removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Left chest tube is in place.  Subcutaneous air is substantial, bilateral,
 unchanged or minimally increased.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 There is most likely present left pneumothorax along the mediastinal contour
 noted.  The precise extent of the pneumothorax is difficult to assess due to
 overlying subcutaneous air collection.  No interval increase in pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.
