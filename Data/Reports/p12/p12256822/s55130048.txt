                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post motorized scooter accident. 
 Now with left-sided pneumothorax.  Fracture of second through fifth ribs. 
 Reevaluate rib fractures and pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The on previous examination identified
 extensive chest wall emphysema, predominantly on the left side, has now
 diminished markedly.  There is no evidence of remaining emphysema in the chest
 wall; however, a small amount of soft tissue emphysema remains in the left
 lower neck area.  No pneumothorax is present and no acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen.  Heart size is normal and no pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  On the frontal chest view, one can identify the
 previously described multiple rib fractures involving the posterior mid
 portions of ribs #2 through #5.  They have not undergone any significant
 interval change in position.  No evidence of callus formation, which cannot be
 expected to be reasonable at this early stage.
