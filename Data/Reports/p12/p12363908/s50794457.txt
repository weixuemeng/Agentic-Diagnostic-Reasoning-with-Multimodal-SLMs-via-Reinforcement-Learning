                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:52 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, :55 a.m.:
 
 New nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of non-distended stomach.  Mild
 cardiomegaly has increased slightly, but there is no pulmonary edema. 
 Borderline pulmonary vascular engorgement is longstanding.  Pleural effusions
 small, if any.  Left lower lobe partially obscured by cardiac silhouette,
 would be better evaluated with a concurrent lateral view.  Conven8tional
 radiographs recommended when feasible.  No pneumothorax.  Right PIC line ends
 close to the tricuspid valve and would need to be withdrawn 7 cm to reposition
 it low in the SVC, if desired.
