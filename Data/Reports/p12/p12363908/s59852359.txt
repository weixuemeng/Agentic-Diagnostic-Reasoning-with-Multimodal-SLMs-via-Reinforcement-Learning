                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intra cerebral hemorrhage, intubated.  Evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.4 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip terminates in the gastric
 fundus.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles could reflect pleural effusions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina, in adequate position.
