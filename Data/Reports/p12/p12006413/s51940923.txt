 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post tricuspid valve replacement.  Assess position
 of lines and endotracheal tube.
 
 A sheath and a right IJ line is present, tip lies in the right atrium.

 right and left chest tube are present.  No pneumothorax is present.  Some
 focal opacities are present in both the right and left lungs.  These were
