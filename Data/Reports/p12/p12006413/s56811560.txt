                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post open heart surgery for valve replacement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and tricuspid valve replacement. 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, but slightly decreased in size
 compared to the prior exam.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Previous pattern of mild pulmonary vascular congestion has
 improved.  Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions have essentially
 resolved with only minimal residual bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  No new areas of consolidation are seen.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  The left PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Resolution of previously noted small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
