 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:
 
 A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There is increased right mid lung
 atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities were better demonstrated on prior
 radiographs.  Diffuse right lung opacity is compatible with layering pleural
 effusion as seen on subsequest CT of the neck.
