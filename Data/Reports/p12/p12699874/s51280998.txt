                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and difficulty in breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Again seen is a large pleural effusion,
 with likely a loculated component on the right, with compressive atelectasis
 of major portions of the right lower and middle lobes.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The left lung is well expanded and clear.  The cardiac size is
 within normal limits.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion again seen, stable to slightly
 increased, likely loculated, with compressive atelectasis of major portions of
 the right middle and lower lobes. If the cause of the pleural effusion has not
 been established, recommended a CT of the chest with contrast, after
 thoracentesis to rule out an underlying mass.
