                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recurrent right pleural effusion status post
 thoracentesis on ___ with 2.5 liters out, based on CT scout likely
 trapped lung, question interval change, if pneumothorax has worsened or
 re-accumulating fluid.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest with contrast from ___, PA and lateral chest
 radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right hydropneumothorax with a moderate amount of
 fluid.  It is difficult to compare size; however, copared to the prior CT
 chest, it appears mostly unchanged. There is no evidence of tension as is
 supported by the fact that the trachea, the aortic knob, and the left heart
 border appear in similar position as radiograph prior to the pneumothorax on
 ___.   Hazy opacities are seen involving the right middle and lower
 lobes. The localized nature of this process more likely represents hemorrhage
 or infectious process rather than reexpansion edema.  The left lung is clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There are no acute bony
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large right hydropneumothorax, most likely unchanged in size from recent
 CT.  No evidence of tension.
 2.  Hazy opacities involving the right middle and lower lobes most likely
 represents hemorrhage or infectious process.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 10:45am.
