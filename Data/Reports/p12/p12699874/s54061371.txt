                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right Pleurx catheter due to recurrent
 pleural effusion, presents with fluid draining from old thoracentesis site,
 evaluate for right pleural effusion or interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently portable AP chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since prior
 radiograph, there has been development of small pleural effusion on the right
 with fluid within the fissure.  Opacity at the right base is similar as on
 prior radiographs and may represent atelectasis; however, infection cannot be
 excluded. There is atelectasis at left lung base.  Peripheral left upper lobe
 opacity is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  There are degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Re-accumulation of small right pleural effusion with opacity at
 the right base, with non-specific consolidation at right lung base which could
 be infectious.  Follow-up to resolution.
