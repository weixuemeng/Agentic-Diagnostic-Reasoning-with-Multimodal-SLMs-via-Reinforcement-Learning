                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recurrent right-sided pleural effusion
 status post large volume thoracentesis with 2.5 liters out, likely trapped
 lung.  Patient with stable O2 sat of 100%, followup chest x-ray to confirm
 trapped lung versus pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from the PA and
 lateral from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large right hydropneumothorax without evidence of
 tension, mostly unchanged from the prior radiograph.  There is slightly
 improved aeration of the right middle and lower lobes. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The left lung is clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable large right hydropneumothorax without tension.
 2.  Improving aeration in the right middle and lower lobes.
