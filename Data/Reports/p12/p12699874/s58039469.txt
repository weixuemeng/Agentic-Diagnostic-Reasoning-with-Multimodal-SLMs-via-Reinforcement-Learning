                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male day 1 status post endoscopy, with difficultly
 breathing and swallowing.  Leukocytosis of 25.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TWO PORTABLE AP VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 In comparison to prior study, there is new medial right basilar and left
 basilar retrocardiac opacity.  Given the clinical history, this is concerning
 for aspiration, possibly developing pneumonia.  There is no associated
 effusion, pneumothorax or apparent pneumomediastinum. The upper lungs remain
 well aerated.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, with marked
 calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.  No free air is seen in the included upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bibasilar opacities, which given the clinical history are
 suspicious for aspiration, possibly developing pneumonia.
