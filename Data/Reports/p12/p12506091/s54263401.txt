                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post bicycle accident.  Evaluate for
 evidence of fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced
 fracture seen.  If clinical concern for acute rib fracture is high, rib series
 is more sensitive.
