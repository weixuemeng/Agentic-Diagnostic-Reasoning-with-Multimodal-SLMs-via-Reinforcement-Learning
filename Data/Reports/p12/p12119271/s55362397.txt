  Endotracheal tube approximately 1.8 cm above the Carina.  Nasogastric tube
  courses below diaphragm into the stomach.  There is moderate to severe
  cardiomegaly.  Linear opacities in the lower lung zones may represent
  atelectasis.  There is the appearance of upper zone re- distribution which
  suggests a component of pulmonary edema.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepctic shock  // ett placement      ett
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube tip
 lies approximately 1.8 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends at least
 below the hemidiaphragm, where it courses below the lower margin of the image.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette that is enhanced by low lung
 volumes.  There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Retrocardiac opacification suggests basilar atelectatic change.
