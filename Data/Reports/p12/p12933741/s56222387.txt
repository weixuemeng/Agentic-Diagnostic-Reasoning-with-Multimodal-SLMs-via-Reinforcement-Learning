                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 815 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cardiac arrest, evaluate for pulmonary
 hemorrhage or effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 12:30 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest ___ at 8:15 a.m. is submitted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian central line
 remain in place.  The heart remains upper limits of normal in size and is less
 globular in configuration than on the prior study making pericardial effusion
 less likely.  There is diffuse airspace process which may represent severe
 pulmonary edema, although aspiration or hemorrhage could also have this
 appearance.  Lucency in the left deep costophrenic sulcus is less apparent and
 given that this is a semi-upright study, likely is projectional as there is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax on the current examination up near the apex.
