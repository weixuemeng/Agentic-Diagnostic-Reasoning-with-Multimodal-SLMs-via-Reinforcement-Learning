                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with J tube , febrile to 100.6, concern for
 infection  // any focal pneumonia or consolidation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance with indwelling ICD pacing device unchanged in
 appearance.  No new areas of consolidation have developed within the lungs to
 suggest the presence of pneumonia.A small curvilinear linear opacity above the
 left clavicle is new, and it is uncertain whether this is a structure internal
 or external to the patient on this single portable view.  If warranted
 clinically, a repeat radiograph could be performed following removal or
 repositioning of external structures.
