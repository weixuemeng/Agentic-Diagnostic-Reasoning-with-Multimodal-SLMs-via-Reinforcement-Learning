  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Vague right apical opacity with a
  linear pleural-based component. If no priors available for comparison from
  another institution to document stability, nonurgent outpatient chest CT
  suggested to further characterize in this patient with a smoking history.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB  // eval ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacity in the right middle lobe is most suggestive of atelectasis
 versus scarring. There is also vague opacity some with a linear pleural-based
 component at the right lung apex laterally.  Lungs are otherwise clear without
 pneumothorax or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Vague right apical opacity with a
 linear pleural-based component. If no priors available for comparison from
 another institution to document stability, nonurgent outpatient chest CT
 suggested to further characterize in this patient with a smoking history.
