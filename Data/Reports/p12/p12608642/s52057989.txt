                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with loculated pleural effusion s/p pigtail
 placement x2  // ?interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the left lung is still
 extensively collapsed with very minimal improvement of left lung aeration. 
 Additionally, the near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax and
 contralateral shift of the mediastinum is consistent with the known large left
 pleural effusion, which is also mildly improved.  The volume of the right lung
 is borderline-low and there is interval development of a mild diffuse
 interstitial opacities particularly in the right lung base suggesting
 interstitial edema.  Additionally,  a small right pleural effusion is noted. 
 However there is no pneumothorax noted in the right lung.  The prominent
 enlargement of the air-filled esophagus is again seen.  The tip of the pleural
 tube is visualized at the level of the left posterior tenth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Very minimal improvement of the large left pleural effusion since ___.
 2. Interval development mild interstitial edema at the right lung base and a
 small right pleural effusion.
 3. Persistent dilated thoracic esophagus.
