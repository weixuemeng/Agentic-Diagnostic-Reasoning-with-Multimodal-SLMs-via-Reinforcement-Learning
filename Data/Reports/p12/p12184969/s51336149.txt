                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.
 
 As on the previous study, there is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs, raising
 the possibility of some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
