                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute on chronic SDH now with significant
 delirium on TFs now with worsening cough and rhonchi  // eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is significant retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms. 
 Compared to ___, the there has been partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm suggesting slight interval progression of left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation
 
 The right lung base is grossly clear.  No gross right effusion.  Small left
 effusion would be difficult to exclude.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with a left ventricular
 configuration.  A right-sided pacemaker type device, with 3 leads, his
 unchanged.  Note is made of several swirling of wires near their origin from
 the battery pack.  There maybe there is equivocal slight upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube is present, tip overlying the gastric body.
 
 Incidental made note is made of finding is consistent with a right shoulder
 chronic rotator cuff tear.
 
 Mild deformity of a left upper chest rib is compatible with an old fracture,
 also seen in ___.  The previously described right lateral mid zone presumed
 granuloma is obscured by pacemaker leads on the current study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse/ consolidation, which appears slightly
 worse compared with ___.
 
 No new site of parenchymal infiltrate identified.  Doubt CHF.
 
 Note made of coiling of pacemaker leads immediately distal to their origins
 from the pacemaker.  Clinical correlation is requested.  Leads are otherwise
 within normal limits.
