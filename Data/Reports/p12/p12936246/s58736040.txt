                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam from
 ___.  On the frontal, again seen are bibasilar opacities suggestive
 of atelectasis versus scar.  There is, however, more density projecting over
 the spine on the lateral view inferiorly compared to prior, potentially
 localizing to the left on the frontal exam.  There is blunting of the lateral
 costophrenic angle on the left suggesting a scar given interval stability. 
 Superiorly, the lungs remain clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 stable, noting moderate-to-large hiatal hernia.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.  Bibasilar scarring versus
 atelectasis.  Increased density projecting over the spine which could be due
 to additional atelectasis; however, pneumonia is also possible.
