                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with shortness of breath and hypoxia. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Limited reference is made
 to the CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right infrahilar and lower lobe streaky opacities with air bronchograms are
 most likely atelectasis, with associated slight elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, as also noted on the prior chest radiograph and CT.  Streaky
 opacities at the left lung base are less prominent but also likely represent
 atelectasis, also noted previously.  Large retrocardiac opacity with scattered
 focal areas of rounded lucencies are most consistent with the known large
 hiatal hernia containing loops of bowel and mesenteric fat, best appreciated
 on recent CT, and perhaps slightly increased from the prior exam.  No definite
 focal consolidation to suggest a focal pneumonia.  No edema.  The heart size
 is difficult to accurately assess on this AP view, also in the setting of
 large hiatal hernia.  Aortic knob calcifications are moderate, overall
 unchanged.   No pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute osseous abnormality on
 these non-dedicated images.  Degenerative changes in both shoulders are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large hiatal hernia
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the right, although right infrahilar
 aspiration or concurrent pneumonia in the setting of the known large hiatal
 hernia cannot be definitely excluded without a lateral view.
 3.  No edema.
