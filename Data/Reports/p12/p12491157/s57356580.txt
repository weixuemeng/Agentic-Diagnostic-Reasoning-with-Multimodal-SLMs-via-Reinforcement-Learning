                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:___ ___ ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man had a ___-foot fall.  Evaluate pulmonary contusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at ___:___ a.m. read in conjunction
 with torso ___ ___, ___:___ a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mediastinal widening on ___ was due to mediastinal venous engorgement,
 rather than hemorrhage.  It has subsequently improved.  In addition, there is
 less in the way of posterior pulmonary consolidation which was either
 atelectasis or hemorrhage.  There has been no increase in any pulmonary
 bleeding.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube
 passes in the stomach and out of view.  Mild cardiac enlargement is stable. 
 There is no substantial pleural fluid.  Detection of subtle chest wall trauma
 is better determined by CT scanning.
