                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is similar mild relative elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the right lower lung suggest minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right posterior basilar opacities, probably associated
 with atelectasis, with no definite evidence for pneumonia.  However, if
 symptoms were to persist or pulmonary symptoms are present, then short-term
 followup radiographs could be considered.
