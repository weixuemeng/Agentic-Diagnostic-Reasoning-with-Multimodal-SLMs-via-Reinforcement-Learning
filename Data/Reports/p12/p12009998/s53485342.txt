                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable radiograph centered in the upper abdomen was obtained to
 assess for placement of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the
 stomach.  There are numerous distended loops of small bowel within the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, in keeping with previously provided history of
 small bowel obstruction.  Oral contrast is again demonstrated within
 non-distended loops of colon.  Within the imaged portion of the chest,
 moderate right and small left pleural effusion are present as well as
 bibasilar atelectasis.
