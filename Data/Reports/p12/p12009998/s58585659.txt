                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To confirm position of the nasogastric tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach with its tip
 ending in the distal end of the stomach.  Right-sided PICC line ends 6.3 cm
 below the carina, probably in the upper right atrium.  Consider retracting the
 PICC by 4.3 cm for appropriate positioning.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 associated with right lung atelectasis is unchanged.  Left lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Orogastric tube tip lies in the distal stomach and is appropriately
 positioned.
 2.  The tip of the right-sided PICC line is low lying, probably in the right
 upper atrium.  Consider retracting the PICC by 4.3 cm for better seating.
 3.  Moderate right pleural effusion associated with lung atelectasis is
 unchanged.
