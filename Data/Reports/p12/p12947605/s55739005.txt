                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Assault with right-sided rib pain.  Rule out
 right-sided rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture is seen;
 however, please note that if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, rib
 series is more sensitive.
