                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  The lungs are well
 aerated without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Trace pleural
 effusions are noted on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 a small amount of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm, which may be
 postoperative in etiology given the patient's history of recent umbilical
 hernia repair.  The imaged upper abdomen demonstrates surgical clips in the
 right upper quadrant and left upper quadrant.  There are several prominent
 loops of bowel, predominantly large bowel in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm may be postoperative in etiology
 given patient's history of recent umbilical hernia repair.
 3.  Prominent loops of gas-filled bowel in the upper abdomen.
