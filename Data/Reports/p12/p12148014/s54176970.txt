 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To rule out parenchymal disease concurrent with ventilation

 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are well expanded and without any abnormal opacities. 
 Heart size is normal, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural abnormality.  There is evidence of old rib fractures involving
 eighth and probably seventh rib on right side, along the mid axillary line. 
 Incompletely imaged fracture of right humerus is better evaluated on the right
 shoulder radiograph dated ___.
