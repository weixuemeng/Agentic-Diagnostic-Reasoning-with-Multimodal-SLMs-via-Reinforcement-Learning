                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided rib pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is partly calcified.  Basilar opacities, greater on the right than left, are
 non-specific but could be seen with atelectasis.  Although study does not
 represent a dedicated rib series, no evidence for a rib fracture is seen.  The
 bones are probably demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute process.  Basilar opacities, suggested to
 represent atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting airway
 inflammation or pulmonary infection cannot be entirely excluded by this study.
