 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral PEs  // eval interval change in
 left pleural effusion partially hemorrhagic, please perform at 8 am     eval
 interval change in left pleural effusion partially hemo
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Minimal haziness at the left base could represent some atelectatic changes or
 merely be a manifestation of superimposed soft tissues.  In the absence of
 silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, is doubtful that this represents
 substantial layering pleural effusion.
 Prominent dilatation of gas - filled loops of bowel are again seen within the
 upper abdomen.
