                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast cancer and pleural effusiosn s/p
 thoracentesis at OSH  // Pleas eval pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2 pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Heart size is difficult to assess giving bibasal consolidations
 and right pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion is small to moderate
 and there is no pneumothorax. Bibasal consolidations primarily involving lower
 lobes but in addition there is substantial prominence of the interstitium that
 has reticulonodular pattern and is highly concerning for lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis although infectious process would be a possibility. Edema in
 the presence of emphysema would be less likely. If clinically warranted,
 correlation with chest CT for pre size characterization of the lung parenchyma
 might be considered.
