                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral chest tubes, metastatic breast
 CA, please perform CXR at ___  // Eval for change in PTX, tubes, effusions,
 please perform CXR at ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 959 the small right apical pneumothorax seen on
 the ___ CT scan is not appreciated radiographically.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a a right-sided indwelling catheter and left sided dual lead
 pacemaker, grossly unchanged.  Also again seen is a small left apical
 pneumothorax, unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular
 blurring, consistent with interstitial thickening.  The small to moderate
 right pleural effusion with underlying right base collapse and/or
 consolidation is unchanged.  Patchy opacity at the left base is similar,
 though perhaps slightly more pronounced on the current film.  There is
 increased obscuration left hemidiaphragm and blunting of left costophrenic
 angle.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Overall appearance is quite similar to the prior film, but with probable
 increased opacity at the left base.
 2. Vascular plethora and interstitial thickening could reflect CHF, but as
 noted on yesterday's CT scan, lymphangitic spread of tumor could give rise to
 similar appearance.
 3. Small left apical pneumothorax unchanged.  Small right pneumothorax seen on
 ___ CT not visualized radiographically.
 4. Small to moderate right effusion with underlying collapse/consolidation
 unchanged.
