                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with metastatic ca w increasing abd girth and sob.  Assess
 for free fluid in abdomen.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___ chest
 radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated.  Subtle increase in lower lobe opacity seen on the
 lateral projection possibly represents known lymphangitic carcinomatosis as
 described on ___ CT. Persistent bilateral moderate pleural effusions
 with associated compressive atelectasis.  There is waxing and waning fluid
 within the right minor fissure.  Left pleural catheter is in place.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart is partially obscured however no cardiomegaly. The
 mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 A left anterior chest wall pacer device is noted with intact lead tips,
 unchanged in appearance since prior examination.  A right porta cath tip is in
 the right atrium.
 
 A partially visualized catheter is again seen coiled within the left upper
 abdomen unchanged in appearance since prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Subtle increase in lower lobe opacity best seen on lateral projection may
 represent previously described lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
 2.  Unchanged moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 compressive atelectasis.  Left pleural catheter in place.
 3.  Waxing and waning pleural fluid within the right minor fissure from
 right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation recommended to assess for lower lobe
 pneumonia.
