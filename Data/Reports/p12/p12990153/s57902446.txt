                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleural effusions, bilateral pleuX catheters
 presenting with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC,
 unchanged.  Bilateral chest tubes are in similar positions.  A moderate size
 right pleural effusion has increased from the prior study and is loculated
 laterally.  Small left pleural effusion appears somewhat decreased compared to
 the prior study.  Opacities in both lung bases likely reflect regions of
 compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No definite pneumothorax is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, now moderate, and
 loculated laterally.  Small left pleural effusion appears perhaps minimally
 decreased from prior.  Bilateral chest tubes in place.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis, however infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
