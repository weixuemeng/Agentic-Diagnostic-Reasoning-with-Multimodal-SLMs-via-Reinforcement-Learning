                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of recent
 pneumonia.
 
 No prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Bilateral pleural effusion is
 demonstrated, small to moderate.  There is also left retrocardiac opacity,
 that potentially might reflect area of developing/resolving infection as well
 as bilateral areas of atelectasis.  The right central venous line tip
 terminates at the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 If prior studies become available for comparison, addendum will be gladly
 added reflecting dynamic changes.
