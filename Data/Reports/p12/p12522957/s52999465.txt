                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // is there lung consolidation?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. The lung
 volumes are normal. There is moderate scoliosis of the thoracic spine, causing
 asymmetry of the ribcage. A small area of fibrotic lung tissue is seen
 projecting over the left costophrenic sinus and is likely a sequela of
 previous infection.  No evidence of current infection.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures on both
 the frontal and the lateral image.
