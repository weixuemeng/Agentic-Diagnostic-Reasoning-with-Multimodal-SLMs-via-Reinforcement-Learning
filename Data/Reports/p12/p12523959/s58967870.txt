                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall with failure to thrive, assess for occult
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung
 volumes are low and kyphotic angulation limits evaluation through the lower
 lungs.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Prominent bronchovascular markings
 could reflect bronchovascular crowding, though the possibility of mild
 congestion is impossible to exclude.  There is no frank pulmonary edema or
 definite signs of pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The aorta appears unfolded.  Bony structures are demineralized with
 deformity involving the left proximal humerus, partially imaged. 
 Vertebroplasty changes in the thoracolumbar junction are better assessed on
 the concurrently performed L-spine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of pneumonia.  Equivocal signs of mild pulmonary
 congestion and mild cardiomegaly.
