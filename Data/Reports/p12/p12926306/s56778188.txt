                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:14 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with left IJ line.  Confirm line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 7:11 a.m.
 
 Tip of the new left IJ line is at the origin of the SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax or associated mediastinal widening.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion is slightly larger, presumably related to the mass-like lesion or
 pneumonia, worsening in the left perihilar lung.  Mild edema has worsened in
 the right lung and small right pleural effusion is stable.  Heart is top
 normal in size.  Heavy calcifications are present in multiple central lymph
 nodes, consistent with but not diagnostic of sarcoidosis.  The patient has had
 multiple wedge resections from the right lung.  No pneumothorax.
