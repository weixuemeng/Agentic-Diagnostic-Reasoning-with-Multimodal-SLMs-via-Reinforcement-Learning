                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, concerning for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are not
 significantly changed compared to prior chest radiograph from ___.  Bibasilar consolidative opacities are likely at least partially
 compressive atelectasis, although infection at either lung base is certainly
 possible.  Linear opacities in the right mid to upper lung in the region of
 suture chain are unchanged, consistent with scarring.  Nodular right mid lung
 opacities are not appreciably changed.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is not significantly changed.  Multiple calcified hilar and
 mediastinal lymph nodes are again noted, in keeping with known sarcoidosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change with persistent small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, and bibasilar consolidative
 opacities that are at least partially attributable to atelectasis, although
 infection in either base is not excluded.  Patchy right mid lung opacities
 could be atelectasis versus infectious foci, not significantly changed.
