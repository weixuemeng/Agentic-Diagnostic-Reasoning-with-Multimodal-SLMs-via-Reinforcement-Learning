 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 bigger inspiratory effort.  Two right-sided chest tubes are in unchanged
 position.  There is currently no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 extent of the pleural effusions, both on the right and the left are unchanged.
 Also unchanged are the known parenchymal opacities and multiple calcified
 lymph nodes.
