  In comparison to the prior study from the same day, there is a new left
  thoracocentesis catheter with an interval decrease in left pleural effusion.
  Furthermore, the degree of pulmonary edema has also decreased. Otherwise,
  heart remains enlarged. Right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is
  stable.   In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of overlying
  pneumonia must again be considered. Left internal jugular line again extends
  to about the origin of the SVC.
