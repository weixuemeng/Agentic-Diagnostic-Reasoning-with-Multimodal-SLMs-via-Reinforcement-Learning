                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:49 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old intubated man with new NG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be
 advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction.
 
 Patient has baseline hyperinflation, but today lung volumes are lower.  This
 may account in part for changes in the lungs, but dense consolidation in the
 right lower lobe is strongly suggestive of new pneumonia.  Interstitial edema
 elsewhere is mild.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position, but the cuff is mildly
 overinflated.  Upper esophageal distention is new, but could be transient. 
 Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  Extensive lymph node
 calcifications in the mediastinum and hila is a chronic finding.  There is
 scarring in the right upper lobe.
