                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear scarring within the right upper lobe
 and within the left lung base appears unchanged compared to multiple prior
 examinations.  Chain suture material in the right mid peripheral lung is
 unchanged from prior.  There is mild interstitial prominence with possible
 peripheral septal thickening at the right lung base which may reflect minimal
 amount of pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is
 unchanged from multiple prior examinations and may reflect chronic pleural
 thickening or small effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No new focal consolidation is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable scarring in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe.
 3.  Unchanged chronic pleural thickening or possibly small chronic effusions.
