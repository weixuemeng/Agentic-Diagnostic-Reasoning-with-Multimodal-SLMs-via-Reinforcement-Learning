                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in bilateral pleural effusions in
 patient with sarcoid.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval growth
 in the size of the right apical pneumothorax when compared to the most recent
 prior study.  The small right pleural effusion is unchanged in size.  There is
 persistent rounded atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal and multiple calcified bilateral hilar
 lymph nodes are consistent with the patient's history of sarcoidosis. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided hydropneumothorax with interval increase in the
 amount of pleural air, with stable small layering effusion.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 4:50 p.m.  Results were also relayed to Dr.
