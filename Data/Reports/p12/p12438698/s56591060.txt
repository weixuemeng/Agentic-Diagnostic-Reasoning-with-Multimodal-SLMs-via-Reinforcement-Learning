                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unexplained leukocytosis, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:59 a.m.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, raising the question of COPD.  Heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.
 There is upper zone re-distribution, without overt CHF.  No focal infiltrate
 is identified.  Flattening of the left hemidiaphragm and possible minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle is noted, but the more dense opacity
 at the left lung base seen on the prior film has improved considerably.  There
 is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and mminimal atelectasis
 at the right lung base.
 
 Right-sided PICC line tip overlies the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable atelectasis at the left lung base, but improved compared
 with ___.  Minimal blunting of right costophrenic angle.  No new
 infiltrate identified.
