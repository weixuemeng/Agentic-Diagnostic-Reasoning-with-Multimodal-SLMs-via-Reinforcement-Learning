                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive calcific changes are redemonstrated in the left lung apex
 compatible with prior granulomatous disease.  There is associated retraction
 or deviation of the superior thoracic trachea to the left, compatible with
 underlying fibrosis.  Less prominent changes in the right lung apex are also
 stable.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Calcification at the aortic knob is
 redemonstrated.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of the chest with extensive calcific changes in the
 left lung apex greater than the right, suggesting prior granulomatous disease
 and underlying fibrosis.
