                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia follow up.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are extensive calcific changes in the
 left apex, suggesting old granulomatous disease.  Some retraction of the upper
 thoracic trachea to this side is consistent with underlying fibrosis.  Less
 prominent changes are seen in the right apex.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia.
