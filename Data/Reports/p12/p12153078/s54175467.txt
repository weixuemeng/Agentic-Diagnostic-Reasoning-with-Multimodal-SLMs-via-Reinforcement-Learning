                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is slight interstitial abnormality with peribronchial
 cuffing that is more prominent in the right lung than the left but vague. 
 Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Questionable interstitial abnormality primarily on the left;
 differential considerations include lower airway inflammation or perhaps
 slight vascular congestion, but there is no frank congestive heart failure or
 focal consolidation.
