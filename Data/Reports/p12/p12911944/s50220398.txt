                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, history of interstitial pneumonitis,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Suture in the left
 mid lung is again noted reflecting old surgery.  There is a stable pattern of
 widespread ground-glass opacity which likely reflects known interstitial lung
 disease.  No significant change from prior exam allowing for slight
 differences in technique/lung volumes.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse parenchymal opacities within the lungs, likely reflecting
 interstitial lung disease.
