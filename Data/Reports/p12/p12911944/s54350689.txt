                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and history of interstitial lung
 disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to both prior chest
 x-ray from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 Compared to prior exam, there has been no significant interval change in the
 widespread parenchymal opacities throughout the lung fields which are
 associated with overall volume loss.  There is no definite new region of
 consolidation nor pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but
 could be accentuated due to lower lung volumes.  This is unchanged from prior.
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of patient's known underlying interstitial lung disease
 without definite superimposed acute process.
