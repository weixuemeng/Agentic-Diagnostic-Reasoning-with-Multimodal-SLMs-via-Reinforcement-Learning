 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with interstitial pneumonitis on chronic prednisone

 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Generalized infiltrative pulmonary abnormality worsened between ___
 and ___, particularly with some exaggeration of generalized ground-glass
 opacification.  Lung abnormality is somewhat greater today than it was in
 ___ but whether this represents progression of the patient's chronic
 interstitial pneumonitis or superimposition of interstitial pneumonia such as
 pneumocystis is radiographically indeterminate.  Lung volumes remain quite low
 exaggerating heart size which could be normal.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.
