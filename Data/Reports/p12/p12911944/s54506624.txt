                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with a history of interstitial lung disease and
 hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were obtained.  Multifocal opacities are
 again demonstrated as on the previous study with findings of traction
 bronchiectasis and fibrosis-related changes in both upper and lower lobes in
 both a central perihilar and subpleural distribution.  The intervening
 interstitium is more prominent than on previous study, though this could be
 due to differences in technique.  A developing focus of infection could easily
 be obscured on these images, and if clinically relevant, a CT could be
 obtained.
