                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, status post VATS lung biopsy for interstitial
 lung disease.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Post-surgical changes are again identified on the left reflecting recent
 biopsy.  There is no substantial change in multifocal opacities reflecting
 known interstitial lung disease accounting for slightly increased lung volumes
 on the present study.  No new opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax
 or effusion.  Unchanged hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative changes and multifocal interstitial
 abnormalities compatible with known interstitial lung disease.
