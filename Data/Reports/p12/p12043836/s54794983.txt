 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Three right-sided chest tubes remain in place with decrease in the loculated
 basilar hydropneumothoraces and some interval improvement in aeration at the
 right base.  There continues to be stable volume loss within the right
 hemithorax.  The left lung remains well inflated with streaky opacity in the
 left costophrenic angle likely reflecting scarring or subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  The heart is stably enlarged
 most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be
 excluded.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve
 replacement.  No pulmonary edema or left effusion.
