                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lactic acidosis with concern for sepsis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Relatively mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, with discordancy raising the possibility of pericardial effusion
 or cardiomyopathy.  Area of increased opacification at the right base could
 merely reflect crowding of vessels, though the possibility of developing
 consolidation would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, consistent with some volume
 loss in the left lower lung.
