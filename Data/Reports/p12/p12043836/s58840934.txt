                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent VATS procedure.  // r/o acute
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, 3 chest tubes remain in place
 in the right hemi thorax with apparent interval increase in moderate size
 loculated right pleural effusion with associated multiple loculated hydro
 pneumothorax components.  Additionally, confluent opacification in the right
 middle and lower lobes has slightly worsened.  New left retrocardiac
 opacification is likely due to atelectasis or aspiration given rapid
 development.  No other relevant changes.
