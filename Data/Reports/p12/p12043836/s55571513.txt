  Two right pleural drains have been slightly withdrawn.  The side ports of the
  chest tubes are excluded from view.  It should be confirmed that the side
  ports are within the pleural space and not within the chest wall - clinically
  or by repeat radiograph which includes the right chest wall.  Right pleural
  effusion appears unchanged and there appears to worsening opacity in the right
  mid lung.  There is no pneumothorax.
  
   The findings were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 22:35,

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with two chest tubes, pulled back 3 hours ago,
 please evaluate for positioning and PTX  // r/o PTX, chest tube positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT performed ___ as well as chest radiograph
 performed ___ at 11:27.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided.  The right hemithorax is
 incompletely imaged.  A left sided central line is identified, its tip which
 projects over the made superior vena cava.  Two right pleural drains have been
 slightly withdrawn.  Side ports are excluded from the few.  A large right
 pleural effusion is unchanged in size relative to prior examination.  There is
 no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Patient is status post median sternotomy, tricuspid and
 mitral valve replacement.  Imaged osseous structures and upper abdomen are
 without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion not significantly change relative to prior study.
 Two right pleural drains are identified though are incompletely imaged. 
 Repeat radiograph or clinical correlation is advised to confirm placement of
 side port within the pleural space.
