                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic shock, to assess volume status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is again substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with moderate pulmonary edema.  The opacification at the
 right base, most likely representing pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis, is less prominent.  This could reflect either decreased pleural
 fluid or merely a more erect position of the patient.  The left lung is
 relatively clear with some mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
