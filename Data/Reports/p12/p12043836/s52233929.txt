                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of severe pulmonary hypertension,
 new onset AFib, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There is significant cardiomegaly noted.  Prominent pulmonary hila are noted
 and there is some subcarinal splaying.  Generalized pulmonary plethora is
 noted, although this is not as prominent as on the prior study.  A few
 nonspecific interstitial lines are seen at the right lung base, again not as
 significant as on the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Findings of cardiomegaly, pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary
 plethora suggest a significant cardiac shunt.  There is no evidence of
 consolidation on this study.  There is probably mild fluid overload.  This,
 however, is not as pronounced as on prior studies from ___.
