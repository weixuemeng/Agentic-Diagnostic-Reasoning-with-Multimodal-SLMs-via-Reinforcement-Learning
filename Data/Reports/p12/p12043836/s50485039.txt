                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of ESRD on HD M/W/F (secondary to HTN, s/p
 failed transplants ___ and ___), MRSA endocarditis of MV and TV s/p
 mechanical MVR and TV repair on A/C (___, c/b cardiac arrest and left
 embolic CVA), and a-flutter s/p ablation presenting with chills and right
 inguinal pain at HD. Found to have Group A strep bactermia and right pleural
 effusion growing yeast.  // ___ SOB, pulmonary edema?  ___ SOB, pulmonary
 edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has probably increased since ___ at
 08:19 despite the indwelling right pigtail pleural drainage catheter
 projecting over the right lower lung.  There may also be greater consolidation
 or atelectasis in the adjacent right lung.  The apparent widening of the
 mediastinum in the region of the right lower paratracheal station, could be
 juxta mediastinal pleural fluid loculation or localized mediastinal
 collection.  Its overall volume is unchanged since ___ although the
 configuration has changed.  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has
 not changed over the past several days, but pulmonary vascular congestion
 visible in the left lung has increased and there is now borderline
 interstitial edema.  There is no left pleural effusion.
