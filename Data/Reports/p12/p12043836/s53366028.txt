                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and
 severe mitral regurgitation and triscuspid regurgitation.  Assess for
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Pulmonary vascular congestion has increased
 since the prior examination, though remains mild.  No large pleural effusion
 is identified.  An unchanged linear opacity within the right mid-lung likely
 reflects parenchymal scarring.  No confluent consolidation is identified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumonia.
