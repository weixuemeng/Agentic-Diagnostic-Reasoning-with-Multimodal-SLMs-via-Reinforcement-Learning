 likely reflecting aerated lung rather than loculated pneumothorax.  No obvious
 pneumothorax is seen.  Left lung reveals residual linear opacities in the left
 costophrenic angle which could reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis
 but is otherwise clear.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable cardiac enlargement
 status post median sternotomy with valve replacement.
