 INDICATION:  Pulled orogastric tube, evaluation for position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:07.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been pulled back.  The tip projects over the middle third of the esophagus. 
 The tube needs to be either withdrawn or repositioned.  Better ventilated than
 before, with reduction in extent of the pre-existing basal parenchymal
 opacities.  No pleural effusions.
