                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: Consolidation and volume loss in the anterior segment of the right
 upper lobe which developed between ___ and ___ has not cleared.  This
 is either an unresolving pneumonia or an indication of bronchial obstruction
 (impaction, mass, foreign body or stricture).  If the abnormality does not
 clear with antibiotics and bronchodilators, as evaluated with conventional
 chest radiographs in two weeks, CT scanning is indicated. Since mediastinal
 caliber has not decreased, the extensive adenopathy seen on Chest CT in ___ is still present, probably increased in the right lower paratracheal
 station, and in the right hilus as well.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged, but stable compared to prior
 studies.   Pulmonary artery dilatation and moderate peripheral vascular
 congestion are chronic.   No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia or atelectasis failed to clear over
 more than one month. See discussion above.
 Chronic adenopathy, probably worsened.
 Severe cardiomegaly and probable pulmonary hypertension.
 Findings discussed by telephone with ED attending physician Dr ___ at
 8:40AM.
