                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of new delirium, history
 of metastatic prostate cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 Porta-cath is seen, with distal aspect of the catheter not well seen, but seen
 to at least the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction;  its distal course difficult
 to assess due to the overlying spinal hardware.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation or
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is
 sclerosis of the left scapular spine.  Known osseous lesions in the thoracic
 spine are better evaluated on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, but otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Sclerosis of the left scapular spine is concerning for osseous metastases.
 Additional foci of osseous metastases seen on prior CT, better evaluated on
 CT.
