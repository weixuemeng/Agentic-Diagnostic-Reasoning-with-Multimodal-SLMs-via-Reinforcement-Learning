 HISTORY:  Fever to 101.4, question pulmonary cause.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There has been interval removal of a right IJ central line.  An epidural
 catheter is present, unchanged in position.  There are low lung volumes, with
 mild left basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation detected.  Prominence
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and upper zone vessels is noted, but
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Possible tiny left pleural effusion. 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is noted in this patient who has an
 apparent history of splenic cysts.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidation detected to suggest pneumonia.
