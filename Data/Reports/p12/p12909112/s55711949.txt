                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with aborted whipple. widened mediastinum?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:38 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Widening of mediastinum has decreased.  It is probably explained by the
 rotation of the patient and mild engorgement of the vessels that has improved.
 Bibasilar atelectasis with low lung volume is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusion if any.  Left upper quadrant abdominal
 calcified cyst is seen as shown on recent CT. Right jugular line is in
 adequate position in lower SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The mediastinum enlargement has improved.  It is explained by the rotation
 of the patient and enlargement of pulmonary vessels that have improved
 compatible with some mild volume overload.
 2.  Low lung volume with bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
