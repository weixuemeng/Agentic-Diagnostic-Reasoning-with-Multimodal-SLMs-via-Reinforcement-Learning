                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new multifocal PNA, s/p intubation for
 increased work of breathing.  // evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 ET tube tip lies at the lower edge of the clavicular heads, approximately 6.3
 cm above the carina.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip over proximal right
 pulmonary artery.  Left IJ central line tip over distal SVC.  NG tube tip over
 gastric fundus.  Left paratracheal surgical clips again noted.  Allowing for
 overlying lines and tubes, no supine film evidence of pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 
 Again seen is diffuse increased alveolar opacity, allowing for technical
 differences, the appearance is not significantly changed compared with ___ at 20:28.  No right effusion identified.  Possible minimal
 blunting of left costophrenic angle is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as described.
 2. Diffuse alveolar opacities are similar to the prior study.
