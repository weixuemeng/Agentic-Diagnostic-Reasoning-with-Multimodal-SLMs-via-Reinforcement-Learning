                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary edema, increasing ___ requirement 
 // please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter tip now lies slightly more distal in the right pulmonary
 artery.  Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.
 
 Again seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs. 
 Allowing for technical differences, there appears to been slight improvement
 in the upper zone and along the upper periphery of both right and left lungs.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Small effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Spine Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies right pulmonary artery, somewhat distal.
 Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.
 
 Persistent diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, but with suggestion of
 slight interval improvement.
