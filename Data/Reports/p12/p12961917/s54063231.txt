                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ as well as chest CT
 performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a left chest port, a catheter tip
 which projects at or just below the anticipated location of the cavoatrial
 junction.  Relative to prior radiograph, opacification of the right upper lung
 zone is unchanged.  Hilar contours are stable.  Patient is status post tumor
 treatment at the right hilus, better demonstrated on recent CT performed ___.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is stable.  Obscuration of
 the left costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural effusion.  Linear
 opacity at the left lung base is likely sequela of atelectasis.  No focal
 opacity convincing for pneumonia is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Osseous structures and imaged upper abdomen or
 without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity likely secondary to atelectasis and probable small
 pleural effusion.  Otherwise overall stable appearance of the chest status
 post treatment of right hilar mass.
