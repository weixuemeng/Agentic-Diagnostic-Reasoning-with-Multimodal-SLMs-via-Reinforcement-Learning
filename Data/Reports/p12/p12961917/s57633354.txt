                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Non-small cell lung CA with recurrent malignant right
 pleural effusion, status post thoracoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tubes are again seen.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right upper chest region of loculated
 gas is again seen, grossly stable in extent.  There has been interval increase
 in adjacent right upper lung opacity which may be due to underlying pleural
 effusion and consolidation with possible component of collapse without shift
 of the mediastinum.  The left lung is grossly clear aside from minor basilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the
 right aspect difficult to fully assess due to the right-sided opacities. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again seen tracking along the right chest
 wall and into the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Loculated pneumothorax again seen along the right upper chest, stable to
 possibly minimally increased.  There has been interval increase in adjacent
 right upper chest opacification which may be due to a combination of pleural
 fluid and consolidation with possible component of lung collapse without
 mediastinal shift, underlying malignancy not excluded.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm may be due to volume loss with possible subpulmonic effusion.
