                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Failure to thrive and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, frontal and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The heart is at least mild to
 moderately enlarged.  The right upper mediastinal stripe appears lobular and
 prominent in width, but this does not represent a change.  A tortuous enlarged
 aortic contour is also stable including calcification.  There is probably a
 small pleural effusion on the left.  Streaky opacities associated with the
 hernia are probably due to atelectasis.  More generally, however, the
 pulmonary interstitium is prominent and hazy suggesting mild vascular
 congestion.  The bones are probably demineralized to some extent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Suspected small
 pleural effusion on the left with patchy left basilar atelectasis. 
 Cardiomegaly, but stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Findings
 consistent with mild vascular congestion.
