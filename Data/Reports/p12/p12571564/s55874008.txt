 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are streaky left greater than right
 bibasilar opacities.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear without large effusion or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 may be due to trace effusions.  There is also suggestion of a hiatal hernia. 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Mild bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis noting
 infection is not totally excluded.  Probable hiatal hernia.
