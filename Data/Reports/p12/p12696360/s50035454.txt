                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
 the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is some
 increased opacification in the retrocardiac area suggested posteriorly on the
 lateral view.  Although this could merely represent atelectasis, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 Of incidental note is contrast material within the colon.
