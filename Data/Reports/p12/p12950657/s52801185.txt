                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to recent study, there has been little change in the
 appearance of the chest except for improved aeration at the left lung base. 
 Diffusely distended loops of bowel in imaged portion of the upper abdomen are
 incompletely evaluated and dedicated abdominal imaging may be helpful in this
 regard if warranted clinically.
