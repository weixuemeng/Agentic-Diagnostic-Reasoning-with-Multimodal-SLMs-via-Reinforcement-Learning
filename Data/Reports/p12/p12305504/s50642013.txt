 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval slight worsening of pulmonary edema, now moderate in
 severity.  More confluent opacities at the lung bases could reflect a
 combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, but co-existing aspiration or
 pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present, with interval increase on the right since the
 prior study.
