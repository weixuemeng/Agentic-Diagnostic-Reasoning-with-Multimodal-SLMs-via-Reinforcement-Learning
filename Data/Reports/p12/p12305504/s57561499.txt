                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ___ tears s/p clipping, now septic 
 // eval for pneumomediastinum      eval for pneumomediastinum
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 17 58
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval appearance of pulmonary mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. More focal patchy opacity
 at both bases may reflect compressive atelectasis especially as there are
 small layering pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded and therefore followup imaging should be
 considered based on the clinical assessment. No evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Calcific density overlying the body of the left scapula
 consistent with known sub scapularis calcific tendinitis.
