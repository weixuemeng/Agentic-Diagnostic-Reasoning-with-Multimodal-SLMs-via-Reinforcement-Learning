                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There
 are bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis given lower lung
 volumes; however, component of infection is not completely excluded.  There is
 no effusion or evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette
 is stable given differences in technique.  Stable calcified nodule projects
 over the right mid lung.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are otherwise grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes on current exam making bibasilar opacities
 potentially due to atelectasis; however, infection is not excluded.  Clinical
 correlation suggested.
