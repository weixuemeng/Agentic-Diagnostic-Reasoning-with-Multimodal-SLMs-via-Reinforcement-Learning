                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Low lung volumes
 seen on the current exam.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen
 throughout both lungs without confluent consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are grossly unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 at the arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen throughout the lungs
 bilaterally.  This could be due to component of interstitial edema; however,
 chronic lung disease can have similar appearance.  Please clinically
 correlate.
