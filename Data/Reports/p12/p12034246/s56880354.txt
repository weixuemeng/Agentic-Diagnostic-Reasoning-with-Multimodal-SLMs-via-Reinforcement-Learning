                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.2 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube tip courses through the stomach, off the inferior borders of
 the film.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2. Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
