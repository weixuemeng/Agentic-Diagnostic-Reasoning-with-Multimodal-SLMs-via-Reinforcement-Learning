                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 5.1 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  The heart size is
 normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A
 linear right basilar density is present, likely representing.  The lung
 volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Superimposed
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or
 large effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar consolidations reflecting aspiration or pneumonia.  Moderate
 atelectasis in the setting of very low lung volumes.
 2.  Appropriately positioned orogastric and endotracheal tubes.
