                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right lower extremity ischemia, pre-op.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques are identified.  There is not definitely calcified opacity the right
 lung apex, some of which has a rounded configuration projecting over the
 lateral aspect of the right first rib.  This may be due to chronic changes of
 the lateral first and second ribs as the superior margin of the second rib and
 inferior margin of the first rib are not well seen Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear where not obscured by the calcified plaque.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcification noted at
 the arch.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques.  Asymmetric right apical
 density could be due to chronic changes of the right lateral first and second
 ribs although underlying parenchymal changes are also possible.  Apical
 lordotic view should be performed to further characterize this finding.
