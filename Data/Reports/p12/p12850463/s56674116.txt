 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 5:15 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, status post recent neck hematoma,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to ___ at 15:28.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5:15 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position.  Right-sided pacemaker is seen
 with two cardiac leads, one of which is discontinuous and likely not connected
 to the chest generator.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably
 enlarged status post median sternotomy.  Skin ___ are seen overlying the
 superior mediastinum in this patient with known recent neck surgery. 
 Improvement in aeration of the right lung base, but persistent vascular
 congestion likely reflects a component of resolving pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacity at the left base may reflect patchy atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
