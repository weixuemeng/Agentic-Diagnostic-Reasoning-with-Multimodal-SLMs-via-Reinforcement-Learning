                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated at OSH for AMS, reported CT findings of
 R-sided infiltrates, potential aspiration event s/p intubation for airway
 protection, now self-extubated  // inteval assessment
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:03
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube are no longer
 visualized.
 
 The patient is rotated and his head is turned and the inspiratory volumes are
 slightly lower, which may account for slightly more prominent appearance of
 the superior mediastinum.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  There is patchy increased retrocardiac
 density, which may be slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.
 
 The right costophrenic angle is obscured by overlying materials and the
 extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  Allowing for this,
 no pleural effusions are seen on either side.  Slight elevation the right
 hemidiaphragm is now visible.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 At the upper edge of these films, a fixation plate is seen in relation to the
 mandible.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval removal of ET and NG tubes.
 2. The superior mediastinum is slightly more prominent, but this may be
 accounted for by patient rotation.  Attention to this area on followup films
 is requested.
 3. Patchy bibasilar opacities, probably slightly worse in the retrocardiac
 region.  While this may represent atelectasis, the differential diagnosis,
 particularly at the left base, includes an early pneumonic infiltrate. 
 Changes of aspiration pneumonitis are also in the differential.
 4. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to the prior film.
