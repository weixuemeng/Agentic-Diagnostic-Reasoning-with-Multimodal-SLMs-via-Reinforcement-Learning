                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coughing blood over the past several days with low back and
 abdominal pain.  History of lymphangiomyomatosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Diffuse increased
 interstitial markings are similar when compared to the prior study and
 compatible with the patient's known history of lymphangiomyomatosis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.  Partially imaged is fusion hardware within the
 lumbar spine.  Widening of the right acromioclavicular interval likely
 reflects remote trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic lung changes compatible with
 lymphangiomyomatosis.
