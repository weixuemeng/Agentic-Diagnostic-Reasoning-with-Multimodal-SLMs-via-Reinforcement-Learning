                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, here to evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in place with
 the tip terminating in the low right atrium, which should be retracted
 approximately 4.5 cm to place in the low SVC.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy with multiple intact-appearing sternal wires.  Multiple
 mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with recent CABG.  There is improved
 but persistent opacification of the left lung base and blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, compatible with a small left pleural effusion and
 underlying atelectasis.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged but stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved but persistent left basilar atelectasis and unchanged small left
 pleural effusion.
 2.  No residual left apical pneumothorax.
 3.  Right IJ central venous catheter with tip in the low right atrium, should
 be retracted approximately 4.5 cm to place in the low SVC.
