                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and left sided rib pain s/p fall  //
 rib fractures?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no significant interval change. The right hemidiaphragm remains
 elevated anteriorly. Old posterior right sixth rib fracture is again seen. No
 new rib fractures identified. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable. One to two ovoid calcific densities projecting over the left mid lung
 are similar to prior and may represent vessels on-end versus calcified
 granulomas.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change. No acute rib fracture seen. If clinical
 concern for acute rib fracture persists, dedicated rib series or chest CT is
 more sensitive.
