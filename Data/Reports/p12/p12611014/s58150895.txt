                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The lung volumes are low with mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. Patchy opacities at the lung bases are probably compatible with
 atelectasis, and not out of proportion to reduced lung volumes, but potential
 are infectious.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild retrocardiac opacification, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
