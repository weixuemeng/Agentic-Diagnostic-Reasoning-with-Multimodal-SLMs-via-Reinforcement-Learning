                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, cough  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable since the prior exam.  There is
 been prior aortic valve replacement with median sternotomy.  The median
 sternotomy wires are well aligned and intact.  There are persistent reticular
 diffuse opacities.  This similar to the prior examination.  No definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No focal consolidation is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral reticular opacities, in the absence of pleural effusions
 and cardiomegaly, is less likely to represent edema.  Other considerations
 include an acute viral infection or interstitial lung disease.  Follow-up CT
 on a non-emergent basis is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up CT on a non-emergent basis is recommended for
 further evaluation.
