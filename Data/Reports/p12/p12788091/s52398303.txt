                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, dyspnea, cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
 The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  There is
 no discrete focal opacity but fissures are thickened with a mild interstitial
 abnormality and pulmonary vascular indistinctness, suggesting mild pulmonary
 edema.  Opacification of posterior costophrenic sulci suggests small pleural
 effusions and perhaps coinciding atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, somewhat worse than
 before, with small suspected pleural effusions.
