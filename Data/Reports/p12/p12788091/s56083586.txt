                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // ?infiltrate, edema ,
 effusion      ?infiltrate, edema , effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are stable.  Continued low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of vascular congestion or
 definite pleural effusion.  Silhouetting of the descending aorta is consistent
 with volume loss posteriorly in the left lower lobe.
 The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, consistent with improved atelectasis
 and effusion.  However, on some of this could merely reflect a more upright
 position of the patient.
