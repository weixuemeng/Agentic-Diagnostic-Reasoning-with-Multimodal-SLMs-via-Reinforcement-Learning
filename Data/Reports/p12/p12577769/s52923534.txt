                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of MS and diabetes mellitus admitted to
 SICU observation and management of pontine bleed.  Question interval change in
 chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent radiographs, there is increasing
 left retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 effusion, but infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting. The loculated right pleural effusion with intrafissural component in
 the major fissure is unchanged with persistent adjacent right basilar lung
 opacity. A left-sided IJ terminating in the SVC and right basal parenchymal
 opacities.  Again demonstrated is free intraperitoneal air related to the
 recent G-tube placement.  Heart size and hilar contours are stable.
