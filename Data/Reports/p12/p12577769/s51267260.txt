                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Nasogastric tube extends to the body of the
 stomach, with the side hole just distal to the esophagogastric junction. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size.  No vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 There is some asymmetry in the apical region, with more prominence on the
 right.  Although this could reflect old tuberculous disease, the asymmetry
 raises the possibility of a superior sulcus tumor.  This area should be
 carefully checked on subsequent radiographs.
