                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with 3 day history of productive cough, right upper
 quadrant pain, nausea; no fevers
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
