                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with brain lesion. CXR for pre-operative
 planning.  // CXR for pre-operative planning. Surg: ___ (tumor resection)
 CXR for pre-operative planning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous image. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is
 no definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 The nodular appearing opacification is could all represent vessels on-end. If
 there is any clinical concern for metastatic disease, CT would be far more
 sensitive and specific for making this determination.
