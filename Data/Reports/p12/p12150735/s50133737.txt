 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable. There is minimal amount of right
 pleural effusion, overall similar to previous study. There is slight increase
 in the interstitium, potentially representing volume overload. No focal
 consolidations to suggest infectious process demonstrated. No pneumothorax is
 seen.  If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT to exclude
 radiographically occult pneumonia might be considered.
