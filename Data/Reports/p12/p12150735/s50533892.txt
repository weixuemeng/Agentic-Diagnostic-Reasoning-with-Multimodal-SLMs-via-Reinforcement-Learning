 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial increase in
 severity in extent of the pre-existing right basal and mid lung opacity. 
 Newly appeared is a left basilar and perihilar opacity of similar morphology. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Unchanged course and position of the
 left-sided PICC line.  No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
