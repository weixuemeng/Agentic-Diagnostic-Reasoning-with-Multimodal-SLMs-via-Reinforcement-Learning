                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fall, altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As seen on
 the prior study, there is marked right apical scarring with upward retraction
 of the right pulmonary hilum and there is now tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  A more prominent rounded opacity in the right hilar region
 could relate to vascular structures although it is more prominent than on
 prior studies, an underlying lesion is not excluded and could be further
 evaluated on CT.  Mild left apical scarring is seen.  There is also some
 retraction of the left hilum upward.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of an acute fracture is seen although if
 there is high concern, dedicated imaging of the region of interest would be
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight increase of prominence of the right hilar region which may be due
 to different position, patient is rotated to the right; although underlying
 lesion not excluded.  Suggest repeat PA and lateral views with patient in
 better positioning.  Alternatively area could be further evaluated on CT.
 2.  Marked right apical scarring again seen with retraction of the right
 hilum.
 3.  No acute fracture seen.  However, if high clinical concern, suggest
 dedicated imaging of the region.
