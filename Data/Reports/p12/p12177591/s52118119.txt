                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MVC and persistent rib pain with new cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No localizing information is provided with regards to the patient's
 pain.  Right greater than left upper lung opacification is compatible with
 known post-radiation related change.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increase in AP diameter is likely
 predominantly due to kyphosis, though some contribution of emphysema cannot be
 excluded.  No displaced rib fractures are identified.   Irregularities to the
 left lateral seventh and eighth ribs reflect old rib fractures.  Heart size is
 top normal with mild S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new rib fractures or acute intrathoracic process.
