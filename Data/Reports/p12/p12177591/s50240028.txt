                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain status post airbag, evaluate
 for rib fractures and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___, CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 Evaluation of the chest is limited due to mild levoscoliosis.  Within these
 limitations, the lungs are hyperexpanded and show unchanged right upper lobe
 nodular opacity.  A nodule projecting over the left upper lung is not well
 visualized.  No pneumothorax is present, although there is mild blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of injury.
