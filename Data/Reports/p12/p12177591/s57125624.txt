                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with pain in lower thoracic spine and right posterior ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, CT chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  The lungs are hyperexpanded, with biapical
 hyperlucency and flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  Postradiation upper lobe
 fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis persist, right greater than left, with
 superior retraction of the right hilus.  Persistent right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 
 The bones are diffusely demineralized.  No vertebral compression deformities
 or displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No displaced fractures.  Please note that radiography is not sensitive for
 chest wall trauma.
 2.  COPD and apical fibrosis.
 3.  Persistent right lower lobe atelectasis.
