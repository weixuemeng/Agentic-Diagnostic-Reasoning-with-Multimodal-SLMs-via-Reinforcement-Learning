                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest Radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with intubation  // check ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier today.  Chest CT from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube
 positioned 3.5 cm above the carina.  Also new in the interval is a NG tube
 with the tip of the gastrostomy tube situated in the left upper quadrant.
 There is persistent left upper lobe collapse.  Suture material in the left
 upper lung is noted.  Right pleural effusion and fibrotic changes are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube positioned appropriately as is the nasogastric tube. 
 Otherwise unchanged.
