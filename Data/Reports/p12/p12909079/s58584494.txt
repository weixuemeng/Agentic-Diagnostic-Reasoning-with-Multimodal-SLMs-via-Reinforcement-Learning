                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 3 hours prior on the same
 day, as well as ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval intubation,
 with the endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.  There has
 also been interval placement of a right PICC, which terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The remainder of the exam is largely unchanged, except
 for improved aeration of the left lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and the right
 PICC terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
 2. Improved aeration of the left lower lung.
