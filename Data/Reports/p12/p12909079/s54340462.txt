                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, CT chest ___, chest
 radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post partial left upper lobeectomy with volume loss in the
 left lung again noted. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob. Previously
 demonstrated opacity within the left upper lobe adjacent to the suture lines
 is likely present, but better assessed on the previous CT. Aeration of the
 left upper lobe however does appear improved since the previous radiograph.
 Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Increased interstitial opacities are most
 pronounced the lung bases, but not substantially changed from the previous
 radiograph. No focal consolidation is demonstrated, and there is no
 pneumothorax.  Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear
 nearly resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial opacities, particularly in the lung bases, may be
 reflective of chronic changes with emphysema. A component of this may reflect
 the previously described peribronchial opacities on CT.
 2. Status post partial left upper lobectomy with improved aeration in the left
 upper lobe. Known opacity adjacent to the suture lines seen on CT is not well
 assessed on the current study.
 3. Near complete resolution of previously noted small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
