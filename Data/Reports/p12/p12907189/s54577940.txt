                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of trach, after episodes of vomiting and
 increased respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view was obtained.  Lateral view was attempted; however,
 due to the patient's overlying arm, other external artifact, the lateral view
 is nearly non-diagnostic.  A radiology technologist info states "unable to
 obtain lateral view."
 
 The midline tracheostomy tube is again seen.  A left-sided VP shunt is seen
 coursing over the left hemithorax.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable and unremarkable.  There has been interval removal of a right-sided
 PICC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
