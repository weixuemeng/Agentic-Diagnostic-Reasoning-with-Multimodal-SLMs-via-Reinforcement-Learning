                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tachypnea, hypoxia.  Please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is a tracheostomy tube in place approximately 4.5 cm from the
 carina.  A VP shunt catheter is seen overlying the left chest, overall
 unchanged compared to the prior exam from ___.  The lung volumes
 are low; however, there appears to be a subtle increase in opacification at
 the lateral left lung base. Note is made of streaky band-like atelectasis in
 the lower right lung.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle increase in opacification over the lateral left lung base, likely
 secondary to overlapping structures, however mild consolidation secondary to
 effusion or aspiration/infection is not excluded.
