                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers, cough  // pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  New patchy and linear bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis, but similar appearance can be seen in the setting of
 acute aspiration and early, developing infectious pneumonia.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
