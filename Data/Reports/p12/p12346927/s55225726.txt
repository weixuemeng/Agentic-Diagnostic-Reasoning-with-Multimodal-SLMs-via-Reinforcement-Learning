                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Increased leg swelling and dyspnea on exertion.  History of SLE.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is tortuous with patchy
 calcification visualized along the arch.  Streaky opacities in the lower lungs
 are most consistent with minor scarring. A very small hyperdense focus in the
 left upper lung suggests a small calcified granuloma.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
