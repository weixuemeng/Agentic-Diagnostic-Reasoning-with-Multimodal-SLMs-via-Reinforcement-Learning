                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post tPA for stroke.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is dense retrocardiac opacity on the left, and the band of opacity at
 the right lung base as well.  Dense vascular calcifications of the aortic arch
 are also notable.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette do not appear
 overtly enlarged, although somewhat limited by the technique.  It is notable
 also that the lung apex is somewhat obscured by patient's head positioning. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Dense retrocardiac opacity is well as a band of opacity at the right lung
 base may represent discoid atelectasis and/or consolidative process. 
 Distinction is difficult without comparison studies or cross-sectional
 studies.
 
 2.  Notable vascular calcifications of the aortic arch.
