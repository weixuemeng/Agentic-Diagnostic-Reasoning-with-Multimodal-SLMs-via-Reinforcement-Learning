 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke  // r/o intrathoracic process
 
 COMPARISON:  NONE AVAILABLE.
 
 FINDINGS:

 GROSSLY NORMAL CONSIDERING THIS FACTOR. LUNGS ARE CLEAR EXCEPT FOR A
 QUESTIONABLE PATCHY OPACITY AT THE LEFT LUNG BASE.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination due to rotation. Repeat radiograph with standard
 positioning is suggested when the patient's condition permits in order to
 confirm or exclude an abnormality at the left lung base.
