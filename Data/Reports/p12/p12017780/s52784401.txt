 Comparison with a CT of the chest from ___ as well as recent chest

 upper lung is again seen, which has been previously evaluated on CT and is
 compatible with a lipoma on prior CT.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or
 CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes at the AC joints, right
 greater than left noted.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
