                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  COPD presenting with increasing shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unchanged with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Calcifications are noted
 at the aortic knob.  There is re- demonstration of hyperexpansion of the chest
 with severe emphysema.  Bibasilar opacities have since resolved compared to
 the prior examination.  Increased opacity at the left apex corresponds to
 scarring as seen on prior CT exam.  Additional areas of chronic scarring are
 noted in the right lung base. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The bones appear generally demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No dense consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
 2. Thoracic hyperexpansion with severe emphysema.
