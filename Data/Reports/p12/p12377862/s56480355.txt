                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Progressive shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably unchanged.  Irregular pulmonary architecture in the
 upper lungs is suggestive of underlying obstructive pulmonary disease.  Even
 allowing for differences in technique, opacification of the right lower lobe,
 though vague, appears more prominent and is concerning for superimposed
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspicion for pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
