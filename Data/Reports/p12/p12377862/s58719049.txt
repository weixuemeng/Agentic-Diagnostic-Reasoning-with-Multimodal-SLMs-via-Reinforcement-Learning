                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Severe dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 pulmonary architecture is irregular and attenuated, particularly in the right
 upper lobe, suggesting emphysema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.   
 
 There are patchy new opacities in both lower lungs, more confluent on the
 right than left side, worrisome for pneumonia, which can have an atypical
 appearance in the setting of emphysema.  The appearance includes a nodular
 focus projecting over the right lower lung of about a centimeter in diameter,
 although possibly a nipple shadow superimposed on a background opacification
 in the lower lungs.  
 
 Projecting over the medial left lung apex is a newly apparent pleural
 thickening, which was not seen before and raises potential concern for
 malignancy at that site.  It is noted that the prior radiographs were obtained
 with a very similar orientation and the opacity appears new.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lower lung opacities suggesting pneumonia.  Findings
 worrisome for a new potentially malignant nodule at the left lung apex.  
 
 Chest CT is recommended to evaluate further as well as consideration of a PET
 depending on the CT findings.  A nodular focus projecting over the right lower
 lung should also be assessed at that time, and may reflect a true lung nodule
 versus part of a suspected coinciding infectious process or nipple shadow.
 
 Findings concerning for malignancy and recommendation for chest CT discussed
 with Dr. ___ at 3:20 pm by telephone on ___.
