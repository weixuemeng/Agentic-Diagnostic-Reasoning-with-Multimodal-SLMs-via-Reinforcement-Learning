                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and GERD-like symptoms.  History of mild hiatal hernia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear.  Moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along
 the mid thoracic spine, which is a component of a thoracolumbar S-shaped
 curvature that is not fully imaged.  No vertebral body anomaly is
 demonstrated.  The vertebral body heights and interspaces appear preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No radiographic
 finding suggestive of a substantial hiatal hernia.  Scoliosis.
