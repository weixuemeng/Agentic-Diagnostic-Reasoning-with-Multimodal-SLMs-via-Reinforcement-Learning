 are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Left-sided pacer
 terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Right-sided pacer leads are abandoned and fractured.  Osteoacrolysis of the
 right clavicle is noted, unchanged. Also unchanged, is right shoulder DJD with
 a high riding right humeral head likely related to chronic rotator cuff
