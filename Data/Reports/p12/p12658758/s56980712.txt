                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p cyberknife fever cough with left lower lung crackles
 // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Left lung base mass with fiducial markers is again noted.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is again seen.  There is a small left pleural effusion and a
 trace right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe
 opacity is best seen on the lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity is most likely atelectasis.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded, but this is thought to be less
 likely.
