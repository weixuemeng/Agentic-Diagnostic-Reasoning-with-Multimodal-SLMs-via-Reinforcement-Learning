                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate fluid overload.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is
 mild pulmonary edema, worse from prior.  Small pleural effusions are improved.
 Opacity in the right lower lobe and could represent atelectasis although
 superimposed infection is also possible; however, it appears improved compared
 to the prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Fluid overload with mild cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions and
 mild pulmonary edema.  Atelectasis or infection in the right lower lobe is
 improving.
