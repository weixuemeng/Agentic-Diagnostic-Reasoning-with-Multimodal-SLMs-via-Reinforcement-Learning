 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7.5 cm above the carina,
 the tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.
 
 The pre-existing pleural effusions are slightly more extensive, causing
 retrocardiac atelectasis and a homogeneous opacity overlying the right
 hemithorax.  Minimal fluid overload is present.  No evidence of pneumonia.
