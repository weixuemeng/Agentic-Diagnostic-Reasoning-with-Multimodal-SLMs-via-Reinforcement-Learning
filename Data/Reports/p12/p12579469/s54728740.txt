                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior PET CT from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, hypoxia.  Patient has a history of rectal
 and bladder cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Interval
 increase in right pleural effusion with near-complete opacification of the
 right hemithorax.  The left lung is clear aside from mild haziness at the left
 lung base which could represent an area of aspiration.  The heart appears
 enlarged, though this is stable.  Mediastinal contour is widened, though this
 is likely due to technique.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the right chest is likely a
 combination of consolidation and effusion.  Vague opacity at the left lung
 base could also represent consolidation, possibly aspiration.  Please refer to
 outside hospital CT for further details.
