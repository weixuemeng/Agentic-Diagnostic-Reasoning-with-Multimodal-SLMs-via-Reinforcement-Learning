                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with reported pneumothorax at outside hospital, now
 intubated.  Evaluation for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to FDG PET-CT performed on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: The study was performed on ___ and was submitted for review
 by the radiologist on ___.
 
 Portable supine radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube is in place,
 terminating 5.9 cm above the carina.  There is collapse of the right mid to
 lower lung with a large right pleural effusion, as seen previously on PET-CT. 
 Additionally, there is patchy opacification in the left lung base, possibly
 due to infection or aspiration.  The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the left hemidiaphragm.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  The patient is
 rotated, somewhat limiting assessment, but there is no definite evidence of
 pneumothorax on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube courses below
 the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 2. Patchy opacification left lung base possibly due to infection or
 aspiration.
 
 3. Right moderate to large pleural effusion with atelectasis of the right mid
 to lower lung.  No definite pneumothorax is identified on this study.
