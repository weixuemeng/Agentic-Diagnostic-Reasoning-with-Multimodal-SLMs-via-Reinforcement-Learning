                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Semi-supine AP portable view of the chest, Indication: new chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:07.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with
 distal tip coursing into the right apex.  A right-sided pneumothorax now
 appears larger as compared to the prior study when it was not apparent.  There
 is persistent collapse of the right mid-to-lower lung.  Persistent patchy
 opacity at the left lung base could be due to infection and/or aspiration. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Endotracheal tube remains
 approximately 5.7 cm above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect likely not included on the
 image; however, the side port appears to be at the level of the GE junction,
 recommend advancement so that the side port is well within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube, which terminates at the
 right apex with interval moderate right pneumothorax, which was not apparent
 on the prior chest radiograph.  Collapse of the right mid-to-lower lung.
 2.  Persistent patchy opacity at the left lung base may be due to infection
 and/or aspiration.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube side port at
 the GE junction, recommend advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
