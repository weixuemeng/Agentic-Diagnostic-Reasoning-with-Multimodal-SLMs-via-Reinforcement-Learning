 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax aside from minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  Ovoid
 opacity over the right lower hemithorax with surgical clip is compatible with
 the patient's history of right mastopexy.  The heart is normal in size, normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
