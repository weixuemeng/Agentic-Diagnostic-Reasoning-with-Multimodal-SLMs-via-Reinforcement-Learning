                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man presenting with sepsis, cholangitis, ? of PNA on
 OSH xray  // assess for pna      assess for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure. Hazy opacification at the bases with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragms could reflect layering pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis, worse on the left.  Although no definite focal consolidation is
 appreciated, in the appropriate clinical setting this would be difficult to
 exclude.  If the condition of the patient could permit, a lateral view could
 be helpful.
