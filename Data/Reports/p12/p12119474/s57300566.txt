                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Urosepsis and fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated,
 unchanged.  Minimal amount of left basal atelectasis is noted associated with
 small amount of pleural effusion.  Nodular opacity projecting over the first
 rib is redemonstrated and not clearly seen on the prior studies from ___, thus correlation with cross-sectional imaging is recommended.  
 
 Right basal opacity appears to be more pronounced than on the prior study and
 might reflect atelectasis, but right lower lobe infection is a possibility
 especially given the patient's described history.
