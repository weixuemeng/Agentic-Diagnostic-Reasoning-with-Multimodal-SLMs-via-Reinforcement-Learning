                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 including mild unfolding of the descending thoracic aorta.  There is a patchy
 linear opacification in the left lower lung most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis, but otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis;
 otherwise unremarkable.
