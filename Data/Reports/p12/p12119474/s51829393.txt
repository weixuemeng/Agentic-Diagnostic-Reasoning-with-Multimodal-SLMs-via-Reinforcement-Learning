                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with tachycardia and possible
 syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiac size.  In
 the right lung base is increased opacity projecting over the inferior right
 heart border.  An additional opacity projects over the left lung base.  These
 could represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the right
 clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the inferior right heart border and left
 lung base.  This could represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded
 in the right clinical setting.
