                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with weakness  // ?evaluate subtle opacity since
 on portal, please schedule on ___ AM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Priors and ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is top-normal in size.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle could
 represent a trace pleural effusion pleural thickening.  Increasing pulmonary
 opacities throughout the right lung, particularly at the right base suggest
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax.  As before, pleural plaques suggest
 prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing right lung opacities could represent asymmetric edema or pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Mild vascular congestion
