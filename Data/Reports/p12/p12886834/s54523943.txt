                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are seen, suggesting prior asbestos
 exposure.  There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which
 could be due to a trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  Subtle
 opacity projecting over the right mid lung could be due pneumonia versus
 underlying pleural plaques, appears new/increased as compared to the prior
 study.  Dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able could be helpful for
 further evaluation.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural plaques suggest asbestos exposure.
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the right mid lung could be due to pneumonia or
 underlying pleural plaque, appears new/increased compared to the prior study. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able could be helpful for further
 evaluation.
