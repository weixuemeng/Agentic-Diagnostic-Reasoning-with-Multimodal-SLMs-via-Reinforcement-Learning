                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure currently being treated
 for pneumonia  // Assess for pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___, nodular opacities with basilar predominance
 have increased.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is stable.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.  No significant pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lobe predominant nodular consolidative opacities have increased.  In
 this patient with aspiration documented on prior swallowing study, aspiration
 pneumonia is considered most likely, likely coexisting with interstitial edema
 from CHF.
