                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in an intubated patient.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an
 endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and enteric tube
 that extends at least to the lower esophagus, with the more distal tube
 obscured by overlying lines.  A left subclavian approach central catheter
 again terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and bronchovascular crowding is exaggerated by low
 lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary edema is improved on the right but worsened on
 the left, which could be positional or related to a small left pleural
 effusion.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema is changed in distribution but not severity.
 2. Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
