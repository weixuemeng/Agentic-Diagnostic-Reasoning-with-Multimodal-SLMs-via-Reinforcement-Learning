                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with polytrauma, intubated, desat with turning 
 // mucous plugging? consolidation? effusion?      mucous plugging?
 consolidation? effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  There has been the development of hazy opacification
 at the bases with obliteration of the hemidiaphragmatic contours, consistent
 with layering effusions and basilar atelectatic change.  Some of this could
 reflect a more supine position of the patient, though this is not the
 indication printed on the radiograph.
 Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and low lung
 volumes.  The hazy opacification makes it difficult to properly assess the
 pulmonary vascularity.
