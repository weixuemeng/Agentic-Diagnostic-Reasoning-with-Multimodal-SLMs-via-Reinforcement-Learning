                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p dissection/ open chest  // eval for effusion 
 eval for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are generally stable, with the Swan-Ganz catheter tip now within the
 mediastinal portion of the right pulmonary artery.  The hyperlucency of the
 right lower chest laterally is less prominent on the current study.  Continued
 retrocardiac opacification is consistent with a combination of pleural fluid
 and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, consistent with
 the preoperative appearance.  Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is
 again seen.
