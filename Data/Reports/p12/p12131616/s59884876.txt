                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with asc aortic graft  // follow up effusions
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  An OG type
 tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A left IJ central
 line tip overlies the upper right atrium.
 
 Again seen is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar to the prior
 film.  Sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve again noted.
 
 Increased opacity at the left lung base with obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle is similar to the prior film.  The previous film showed
 some patchy alveolar opacity at in the left mid zone laterally.  This area is
 obscured by overlying iatrogenic structures on the current film --___, it
 appears at least partially improved if not completely resolved.
 
 There is a small to moderate layering right pleural fusion, which is probably
 slightly larger, allowing for differences in technique.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution with diffuse vascular blurring, and
 atelectasis the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  Note is made that the left IJ line overlies the
 upper right atrium unchanged.
 
 Cardiomegaly, sternotomy wires, and prosthetic valve again noted, unchanged.
 
 Patchy opacity left base with left pleural effusion unchanged.  Previously
 seen left lateral mid zone opacities are obscured by overlying materials, but
 have probably improved.
 
 Layering right pleural effusion may be slightly larger.  Atelectasis at the
 right base is similar.
 
 CHF, minimally improved.
