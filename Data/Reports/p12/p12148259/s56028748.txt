                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration, though there are still low lung volumes.  There is a tiny
 left apical pneumothorax.  The upper mediastinum appears within normal limits.
 Atelectatic changes are again seen bilaterally, more prominent on the left
 with blunting of both costophrenic angles.
