                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute onset severe abdominal pain.  Evaluate
 for free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  More than expected elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 
 3. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be a chronic finding.
 
 4. Minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
