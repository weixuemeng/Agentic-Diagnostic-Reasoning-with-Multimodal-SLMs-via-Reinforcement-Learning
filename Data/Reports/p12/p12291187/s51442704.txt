 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for a
 portable supine technique and rotation related to apparent scoliosis. 
 Band-like area of opacity in the left mid lung is likely due to atelectasis,
 and more coarse reticular opacities at the bases suggest a fibrotic
 interstitial lung process in these regions.  No confluent areas of
 consolidation are observed, and there are no definite pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
