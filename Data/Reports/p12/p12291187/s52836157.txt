                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, assess NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Dobbhoff tube
 courses into the upper stomach but can be advanced 5 to 7 cm if desired for
 more optimal positioning.  The lungs are well expanded with bandlike left
 midlung atelectasis as well as newly evident left pleural effusion and
 accompanying atelectasis.  Interstitial abnormality with coarse reticular
 opacities at the bases bilaterally could reflect the fibrotic process in these
 areas.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube in the upper stomach, could be advanced 5-7 cm if desired
 for more optimal positioning.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
