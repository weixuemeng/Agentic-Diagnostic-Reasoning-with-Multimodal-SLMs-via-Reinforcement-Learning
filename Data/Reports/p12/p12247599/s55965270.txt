                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subdural hematoma after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are also
 unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities most
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No displaced fractures are seen.  Thoracic fusion hardware is
 incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
