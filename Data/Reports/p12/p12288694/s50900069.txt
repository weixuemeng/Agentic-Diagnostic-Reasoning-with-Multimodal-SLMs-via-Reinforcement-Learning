                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for two months.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal on the PA view.  On the lateral
 view density projecting above the level of the hila is noted and unclear if
 this represents lymph node or summation of shadows.  The lungs are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Giving the abnormality described in patient history, further evaluation with
 chest CT is recommended to exclude the possibility of lymphadenopathy.
 
 The lateral view demonstratestram lines like opacities projecting over the
 lower lungs posteriorly that might reflect minimal areas of bronchiectasis in
 the lower lobes that also can be reassessed on the chest CT.
