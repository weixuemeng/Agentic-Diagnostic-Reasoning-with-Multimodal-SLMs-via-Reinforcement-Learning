                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new right internal jugular central venous
 catheter. Endotracheal tube tip pulled back 3cm
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has been retracted with the tip now terminating
 approximately 2.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is demonstrated which is
 seen in suboptimal positioning with the tip proximal to the gastroesophageal
 junction.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is within the mid
 SVC. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette
 is present with left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Low lung volumes are present. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small left pleural effusion is noted
 with left basilar atelectasis. Multiple clips are again noted within the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube has been mildly retracted but still remains somewhat low
 lying.
 2. Enteric tube is in suboptimal position, with tip above the gastroesophageal
 junction and should be advanced.
 3. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax.
 4. Small left pleural effusion with left basilar patchy opacity, likely
 atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 10:18 PM..
