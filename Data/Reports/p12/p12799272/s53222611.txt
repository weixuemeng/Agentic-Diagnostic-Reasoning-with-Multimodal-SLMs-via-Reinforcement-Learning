                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p CABG/TV repair w/recent
 extubation evaluate lung fields
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube has been removed.  Dobbhoff or other orogastric tube is present,
 extending beneath the diaphragm, beyond the inferior exam of the film.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is a left-sided dual lead
 pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.  A
 tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is noted.
 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar to the prior study.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, arguably more so than on the prior film. 
 However, although there is retrocardiac patchy opacity, it is is similar and
 probably very slightly improved compared with the prior study.
 
 Mild right-greater-than-left upper zone redistribution and minimal patchy
 opacity, question atelectasis, are seen in the cardiophrenic region, similar
 to the prior study.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of ET tube.  Probable slight interval improvement in left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Otherwise , no significant interval
 change.
