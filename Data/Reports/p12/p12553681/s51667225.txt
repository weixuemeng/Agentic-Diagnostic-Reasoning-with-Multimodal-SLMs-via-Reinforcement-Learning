                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent cross-sectional
 imaging such as a chest CT from ___ and PET-CT imaging from

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right anterior
 hemidiaphragm is again prominent with streaky opacities suggestive of minor
 associated atelectasis.  However, otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Surgical
 clips project over the right breast. Incidental note is made of mild
 distention of the transverse colon.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
