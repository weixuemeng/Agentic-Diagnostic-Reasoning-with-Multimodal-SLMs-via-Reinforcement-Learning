                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left middle cerebral artery thrombectomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-upright AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach,
 its inferior extent not imaged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appears stable. Lung volumes are low. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. What is new is extensive opacification of the right upper lung
 worrisome for aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New consolidation in the right upper lung, question pneumonia or aspiration.
 Short-term follow-up radiographs are suggested to reassess.
