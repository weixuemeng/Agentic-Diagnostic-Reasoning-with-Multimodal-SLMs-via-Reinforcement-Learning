                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M L MCA stroke s/p TPA and intra-arterial thrombectomy  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A newly placed right PICC line ends in the low SVC. An endotracheal tube
 terminates in the lower trachea. An enteric tube enters the stomach, distal
 tip not visualized. Bilateral upper lobe airspace opacities are not
 appreciably changed since the study of 1 day prior.  However, there is a new
 right lower lobe opacity, and concurrent mild pulmonary edema. There is no
 pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities with new involvement of the right lower lobe is
 likely due to evolving multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
