                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o w/unknown PMH s/p TPA and intra-arterial thrombectomy of L
 MCA occlusion.  // PNA?     PNA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with increasing pulmonary venous

 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia radiographically in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
