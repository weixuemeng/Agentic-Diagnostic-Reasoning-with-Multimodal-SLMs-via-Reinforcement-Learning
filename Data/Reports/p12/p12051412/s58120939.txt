                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, status post rib fracture.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is only a minimal
 decrease in extent of the known right pneumothorax.  The additional air-fluid
 levels seen at the lung bases have slightly increased in extent.  Also
 increased is atelectasis at the lung bases.
 
 The left lung base shows an unchanged area of atelectasis, otherwise, the left
 lung is unremarkable.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
