                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, recent pneumothorax.  Is
 there pneumothorax or pleural effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is neither pneumothorax nor appreciable pleural effusion.  Atelectasis
 and pleural thickening in the right lower lung account for thickening of the
 pleura laterally and obliteration of the right heart border.  Left lung is
 clear.  Configuration of the trachea with side-to-side narrowing at the
 thoracic inlet is often seen with chronic lung disease and/or
 tracheobronchomalacia.  There are no focal findings in the lungs, no
 cardiomegaly or vascular abnormality to suggest either acute cardiac or
 pulmonary disease.
 
 ___ was telephoned as requested.
