                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, interval=al changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 There is streaky density bilaterally consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
 Density in the lower left mid lung is somewhat increased and superimposed
 focal consolidation cannot be excluded but is unlikely.  The left
 hemidiaphragm appears elevated as before.  The heart appears large.  The aorta
 is calcified.  Mediastinal structures are stable.  A right PICC now terminates
 in the region cavoatrial junction.  There is no other significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Line placement as described.  Subsegmental atelectasis.
