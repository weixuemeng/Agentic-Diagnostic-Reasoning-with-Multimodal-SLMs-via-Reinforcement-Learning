                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a history of drug overdose, now with worsening
 hypoxia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits 5 cm above the carina.  The
 endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of the field of view.  The heart size
 is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate central
 vascular engorgement as well as a lobulated contour with areas of tracheal
 narrowing.  The lungs demonstrate diffuse interstial abnormality that is
 improving.  However, there is worsening of the right lower lung consolidation.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. ET tube is in place.
 2. Worsening right lower lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia (possibly
 aspiration) or hemorrhage.
 3. Lobulated mediastinal contours with tracheal narrowing raise suspicion for
 lymphadenopathy.
