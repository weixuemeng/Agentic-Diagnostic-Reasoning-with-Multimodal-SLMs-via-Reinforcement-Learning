                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, intubated with pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive patchy bilateral opacities are predominantly found on the
 right side. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  ET tube
 terminates 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach
 and off the view of the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asymmetric opacities, right greater than left.  Possibilities
 would include asymmetric pulmonary edema, but atypical infection can also be
 considered.
