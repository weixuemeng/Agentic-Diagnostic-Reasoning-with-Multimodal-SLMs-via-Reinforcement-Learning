                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube placed that appears to be freely moving.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW CENTERED LOW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal film dated ___.
 
 The distal tip of the Dobbhoff tube is not included on these views.  The
 pattern of the Dobbhoff tube suggests reduction in the degree of redundancy
 seen on the prior film, with the gastric fundus loop no longer visualized. 
 The mid abdomen loop appears slightly narrowed, but appears similar in
 appearance, possibly with narrowing accentuated by differences in x-ray beam
 angulation.  
 
 New on the current film, there is considerable overlying coiled tubing over
 the left mid abdomen.  This  tubing appears separate from the Dobhoff  and
 could lie outside the patient.  Additional redundant tubing overlying the
 chest, presumably overlies outside the patient.  Multiple EKG leads are
 present.  
 
 Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation is noted, similar to a chest x-ray from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube present, with tip extending beneath the inferior edge of the
 film (just below the level of the iliac crest).  If clinically indicated, a
 full abdominal film could help for more complete assessment.
 
 2.  Tubing overlying the mid abdomen, which appears separate from  Dobbhoff
 tube, ? outside of patient.  Clinical correlation requested.
