                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post ERCP with chest pain, rule out
 perforation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no free air under
 the right hemidiaphram. Lucency under the left hemidiaphragm is most likely
 due to a distended stomach. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and
 notable for a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Linear opacity at the left lung base
 is likely atelectasis.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Lucency under the left hemidiaphragm
 is likely a distended stomach rather than free air.  If there is clinical
 concern, recommend repeat radiograph in a few hours. 
 2. Atelectasis at the left lung base.
