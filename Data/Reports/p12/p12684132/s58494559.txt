                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  E. coli bacteremia after prostate biopsy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ portable radiograph as well as multiple prior studies dating back to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  As compared to prior radiograph,
 there is new right lower and right mid lobe opacities, that might reflect
 interval development of multifocal infectious process.  There are otherwise
 unchanged clear lungs.  There is small amount of pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Although the findings might reflect improved
 aspiration/pulmonary edema, the current focal nature is highly concerning for
 infectious process and should be further monitored.
