                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To rule out pneumonia.

 chest radiograph from ___ to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: Since ___, mild pulmonary edema has further improved, and
 persisting right infrahilar and left lower lung opacities, either represents
 residual edema and/or infection. Further clinical correlation is need and
 should be appropriately followed up on radiograph to monitor resolution.
 Paradoxic to improved pulmonary edema, bilateral, small, pleural effusions are
 new.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.
