                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DKA, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:04 p.m. and allowing for differences in technique,
 I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carina, and an NG
 tube, tip overlying the gastric fundus.  Also again seen is a fusion construct
 in the upper thoracic spine.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There may be mild plethora of the upper zone
 vessels, suggesting mild fluid overload.  No gross interstitial or alveolar
 edema is identified. No focal consolidation identified. No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild vascular plethora, but overall similar to ___ at
 20:04 p.m.
