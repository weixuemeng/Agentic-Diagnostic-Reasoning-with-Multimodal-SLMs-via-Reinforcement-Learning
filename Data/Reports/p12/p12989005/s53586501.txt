                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of IDDM who was unresponsive with
 glucose.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen, distal tip not well seen, but likely terminating in the
 mid SVC.  No focal consolidation or hemothorax is seen.  The costophrenic
 angles are not sharp, particularly on the left, but this may relate to
 overlying soft tissue.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The aorta is slightly
 tortuous and calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation seen.
