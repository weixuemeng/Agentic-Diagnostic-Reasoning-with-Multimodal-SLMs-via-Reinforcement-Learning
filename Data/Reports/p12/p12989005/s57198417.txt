                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is engorgement of the vascular pedicle with cephalized and
 indistinct pulmonary vascularity.  No discrete focal consolidation is noted. 
 The mediastinum is unremarkable otherwise.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, but stable.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  In the setting of cardiomegaly and shortness of breath, the hazy
 interstitial opacities is presumably cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Consider
 repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying
 infection.
