                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with diabetes and gastric cancer, now with DKA
 and question and concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 likely secondary to poor inspiration.  There is asymmetric, right greater than
 left, diffuse opacification of the lungs which is consistent in appearance
 with vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate
 clinical context pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, with right greater than left lung involvement.
