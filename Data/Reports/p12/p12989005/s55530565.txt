                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Low-grade fever, weakness, on chemotherapy, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Port noted over
 the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the low SVC.  Linear
 plate-like atelectasis is seen within the lower lung.  While the appearance is
 more suggestive of atelectasis, the possibility of a subtle pneumonia would be
 impossible to excluded.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  Vascular
 stents are seen in the upper abdomen seen on the lateral projection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Plate-like atelectasis in the lower lungs, cannot excluded a
 subtle pneumonia.
