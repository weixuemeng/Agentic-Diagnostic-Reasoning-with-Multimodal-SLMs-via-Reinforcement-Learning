                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle posterior left base opacity likely relates to atelectasis/vascular
 structures rather than consolidation.  No evidence of consolidation is seen
 elsewhere.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
