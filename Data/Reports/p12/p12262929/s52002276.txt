 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Lower abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Subtle asymmetrically increased opacities of the
 right lung base. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtly increased opacities of the right lung base corresponding to probable
 pneumonia on subsequent CT.
