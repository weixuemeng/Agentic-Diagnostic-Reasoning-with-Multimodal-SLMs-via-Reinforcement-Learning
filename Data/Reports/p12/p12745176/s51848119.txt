                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Back pain status post fall, no numbness, tingling.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is
 minimal biapical pleural thickening.  There may be subtle minimal loss of
 height of a mid thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs.
 2.  Possible subtle loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is also
 noted on the thoracic spine radiographs.  Recommend clinical correlation for
 site of point tenderness and if clinical concern remains high, CT is more
 sensitive.
