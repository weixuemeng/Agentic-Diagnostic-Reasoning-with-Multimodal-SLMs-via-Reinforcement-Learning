                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size appears to be enlarged as compared to previous study, but it might
 be related to lower lung volumes.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Repeated radiograph with an emphasis on full inspiration is recommended to
 exclude the possibility of cardiomegaly.  If persistent even on full
 inspiration, assessment with echocardiography is recommended.
