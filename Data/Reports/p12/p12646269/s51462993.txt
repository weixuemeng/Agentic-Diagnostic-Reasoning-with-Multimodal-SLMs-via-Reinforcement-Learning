                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared
 to the left.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a
 widespread predominantly central vague interstitial abnormality.  Upper zone
 pulmonary vascularity does not appear distended and vessels are fairly
 distinct, however.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the mid to
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting a mild interstitial abnormality. 
 Considerations include atypical infection or possibly pulmonary congestion. 
 Clinical correlation advised.
