                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Followup of known pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Outside radiograph from HVMA ___ from earlier on the same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new pigtail catheter has been placed and projects over the right
 hemithorax.  There is a small residual right apical pneumothorax but markedly
 decreased.  Irregularity along the superior margin of the right pleural
 surface suggests that a bleb may be the etiology, although a discrete bleb is
 not visualized.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small residual right apical pneumothorax, but markedly decreased
 following chest tube placement.
