                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tachypnea and lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is marked
 kyphotic angulation in the mid thoracic spine at the level of a markedly
 compressed mid thoracic vertebral body which appears to have been present on
 prior imaging, though may be increasingly kyphotic in the interval.  Given
 this evaluation is limited, there is no focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax seen.  The heart size is difficult to assess, although it appears
 essentially stable.  Mediastinal contour is similar.  Patient is slightly
 leftward rotated which limits evaluation somewhat.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.  Marked kyphotic angulation of the chest at
 the level of a mid thoracic vertebral body severe compression deformity which
 has been seen on prior imaging studies.
