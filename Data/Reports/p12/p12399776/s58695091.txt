 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Accordingly streaky basilar opacities
 are most likely due to atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
