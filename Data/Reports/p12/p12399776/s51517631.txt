                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment.  The hila appear somewhat prominent and hilar congestion
 difficult to exclude.  There is a subtle nodular opacity projecting over the
 right upper lung which may represent confluence of shadows though the
 possibility of a pulmonary nodule or a a focal consolidation is difficult to
 exclude in the correct clinical setting.  No large effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. 
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nodular opacity projecting over the right upper lung, question confluence
 of shadows, may be resolves with dedicated PA and lateral possibly with
 oblique projections.
 2. Hilar prominence may reflect central congestion versus nodal prominence. 
 Please correlate clinically.
