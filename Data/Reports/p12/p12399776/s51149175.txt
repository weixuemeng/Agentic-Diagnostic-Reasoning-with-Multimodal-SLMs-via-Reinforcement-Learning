                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen. 
 There is asymmetric left basilar opacity compared to the right.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected on this limited exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with asymmetric left basilar opacity.  While
 this could be due to atelectasis, infection would also be possible.  Consider
 PA and lateral views for improved characterization.
