                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CTA chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result of low lung
 volumes and appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Mild widening of the superior mediastinal contour and fullness of the
 hilar regions bilaterally is suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy, as
 detected on the previous CT.  Ill-defined patchy and nodular opacities within
 the lower lobes bilaterally as well as within the right upper lobe are
 minimally improved in the interval.  Worsening ill-defined nodular, patchy
 opacities however are noted in the left upper lobe and lingula.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New ill-defined patchy and nodular opacities in the left upper lobe and
 lingula, and minimal improvement in previously demonstrated ill-defined
 opacities in both lower lobes and right upper lobe.  Findings are compatible
 with multifocal pneumonia.  Reactive lymphadenopathy within the hila
 bilaterally and mediastinum.
