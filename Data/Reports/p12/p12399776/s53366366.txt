                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ? vascular congestion on previous CXR, c/o mild
 dyspnea  // Acute process, attn to edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. Mild prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature may relate to low lung volumes versus very minimal pulmonary
 vascular engorgement. No definite focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable. Suggestion of mitral anulus calcification is seen on the frontal
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature could relate to low
 lung volumes versus very minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement. No definite
 focal consolidation.
