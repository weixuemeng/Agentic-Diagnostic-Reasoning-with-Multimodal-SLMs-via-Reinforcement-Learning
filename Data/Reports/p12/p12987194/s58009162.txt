 INDICATION:  Systolic heart failure, worsening shortness of breath, evaluation
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the signs of pulmonary
 edema have decreased.  Currently, no signs of pulmonary edema are present. 
 However, bilateral pleural effusions have newly appeared.  These effusions
 cause atelectasis at both lung bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette
 continues to be moderately enlarged.
