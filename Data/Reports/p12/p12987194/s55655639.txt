  Compared to the recent prior radiograph from ___, there is
  interval increase in a right pleural effusion. Left pleural effusion has also
  likely mildly increased. Enlarged cardiac silhouette grossly stable.
  Mediastinal contour also unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
  There is vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Left mid lung
  opacity was seen on radiograph from ___, possibly related to
  atelectasis or scarring in this region although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
