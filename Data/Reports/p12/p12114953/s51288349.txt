                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pericardial effusion status post
 pericardiocentesis, possibly malignant effusion secondary to spiculated lung
 mass seen on imaging at outside hospital.  Evaluate lung mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, consistent with known
 pericardial effusion.  There is a pericardial drain overlying the heart. Known
 left upper lobe spiculated mass, seen on outside chest CT, cannot be
 visualized on this examination.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 related to a small pleural effusion.  There is mild atelectasis at the right
 lung base.  The right lung is otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, consistent with known pericardial effusion.
 
 2. Left upper lobe mass identified on prior outside chest CT cannot be
 visualized on this examination.
