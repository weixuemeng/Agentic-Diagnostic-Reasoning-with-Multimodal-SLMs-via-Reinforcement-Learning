                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with left upper lobe mass and pericardial effusion.
 Evaluate for left pleural effusion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema seen.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions present, left greater than right.  Pericardial catheter
 removal noted. Cardiac silhouette slightly smaller compared to previous
 radiograph, which could be secondary to technical aspects of PA radiograph
 which results in less magnification of the heart compared to the prior AP
 portable radiograph.  Left upper lobe spiculated mass is noted. No bony
 abnormalities are noted.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval removal of pericardial catheter without increase in size of
 cardiac silhouette following removal. 
 
 2. Bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right.
