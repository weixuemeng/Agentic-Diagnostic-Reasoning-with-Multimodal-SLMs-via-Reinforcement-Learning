                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pericardial effusion, status post pericardiocentesis with drain
 placement.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new pericardial drainage catheter, with its tip positioned over the
 right heart border.  A right sided Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC, unchanged
 compared to the recent CT from ___.  Enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette has substantially increased compared to the most recent radiograph
 from ___, likely decreased compared to the recent CT from ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 clear. High density material in the colon relates to prior oral contrast
 administration for the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Probable slight decrease in size of pericardial effusion compared to the
 chest CT from ___, status post placement of a pericardial drain.  No
 evidence that the residual effusion is hemodynamically significant.
