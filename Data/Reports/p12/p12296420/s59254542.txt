                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Lung volumes are relatively low.  Focal opacity at left
 lung base with adjacent elevation of left hemidiaphragm favors atelectasis. 
 Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Focal left lower lobe opacity is likely due to localized atelectasis
 adjacent to an elevated hemidiaphragm.  
 
 2.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
