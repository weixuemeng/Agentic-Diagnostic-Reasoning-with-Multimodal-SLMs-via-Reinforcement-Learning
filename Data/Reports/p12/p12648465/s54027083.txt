                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with esophagitis and abdominal pain, now with
 increased leukocytosis, possible opacity since on portable xray. Evaluate for
 possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, earlier on the same day at
 ___ am.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear platelike atelectasis in the left lower lung with similar to exam
 earlier on the same date.  Opacity just medial to this is overall unchanged
 and does not have the typical appearance of pneumonia on the lateral view -
 maybe some atelectasis. The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax. Small left
 pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is not
 widened. The hila are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion. No convincing radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.
