                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ventricular tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic and mitral valve
 replacements.  Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar.  Mild upper
 zone vascular redistribution suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy atelectasis is present in the lung bases without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Hypertrophic changes are
 again noted in the thoracic spine as well as the left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
