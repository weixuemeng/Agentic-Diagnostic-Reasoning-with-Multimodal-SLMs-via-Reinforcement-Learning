                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips are present in the mediastinum.  Cardiac silhouette
 is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta is tortuous.  Widening of superior
 mediastinum appears unchanged, and corresponds to tortuous vessels and
 mediastinal fat on prior PET CT of ___. Assessment  of the lungs
 demonstrates linear scarring within the left upper lobe and lingula as well as
 focal area of linear scar vs. atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  On the
 lateral view, a subtle area of opacity is identified overlying the lower
 thoracic spine, partially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm contour. 
 Otherwise, lungs appear similar to the prior radiograph.  No pleural effusion
 or acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable focal/early left lower lobe pneumonia.  Findings
 entered into radiology communications dashboard on date of study.
