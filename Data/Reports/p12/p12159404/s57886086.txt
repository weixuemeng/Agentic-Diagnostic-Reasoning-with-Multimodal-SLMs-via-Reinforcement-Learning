                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is mild cardiac enlargement.  No
 typical configurational abnormality can be identified.  The thoracic aorta is
 mildly widened and elongated, but no local contour abnormalities identified. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly within normal
 limits.  Noteworthy on the frontal view is an increased translucency of the
 right lung base structures related to absence of the right breast shadow in
 this patient who apparently must have a history of right-sided mastectomy.
 
 In comparison with the next preceding study of ___, no significant
 interval change can be identified.  Thus, mild cardiac enlargement but no
 signs of advanced pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates.
