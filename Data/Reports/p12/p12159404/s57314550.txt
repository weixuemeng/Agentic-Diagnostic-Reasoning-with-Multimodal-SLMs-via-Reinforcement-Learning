                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain and hematemesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new focal consolidation in the left mid and lower lung
 zone.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 The left costophrenic angle is somewhat obscured, which could be due to the
 adjacent opacity or small pleural effusion.  There is no right-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  There is no free intraperitoneal is identified below the
 hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left mid and lower lung zone opacity, which in the proper
 clinical setting is concerning for pneumonia.  Other etiologies could include
 aspiration or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although these are thought to be
 less likely; malignant involvement is also not excluded as a coinciding
 etiology.
