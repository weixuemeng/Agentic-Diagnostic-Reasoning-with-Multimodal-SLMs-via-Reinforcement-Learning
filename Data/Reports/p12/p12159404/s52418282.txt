                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast ca presenting with vomiting and
 nausea. possible aspiration. now with rise in WBC as well  // high concern for
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, previously reported
 bibasilar opacities have nearly resolved with minimal residual patchy left
 retrocardiac opacity remaining.  These findings could be due to resolving
 atelectasis and or aspiration.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for new
 heterogeneous opacities in the right suprahilar region which may be due to the
 aspiration (especially especially considering the presence of esophageal
 distension) or an early focus of infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
