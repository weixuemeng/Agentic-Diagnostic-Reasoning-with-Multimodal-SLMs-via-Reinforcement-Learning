 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval improvement in bilateral pulmonary opacities with mild bibasilar
 atelectasis persisting.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 given differences in patient positioning.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is improved.
