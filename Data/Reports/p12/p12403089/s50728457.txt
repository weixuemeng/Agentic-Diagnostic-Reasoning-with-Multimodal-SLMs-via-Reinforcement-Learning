                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever to ___F, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified are multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical
 clips.  A tortuous thoracic aorta is re-identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, and otherwise within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
 without frank pulmonary edema.  Equivocal opacity at the right lung base may
 represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, no
 evidence of focal consolidation elsewhere.  Aortic valve replacement is noted.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Mild asymmetric opacity at the right lung base is
 nonspecific, could represent developing infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
