                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lower lobe pneumonia has essentially cleared, with only
 small residual linear opacities remaining, likely representing residual
 atelectasis and/or developing scar.  There is also apparent bronchial wall
 thickening present centrally in the right lower lobe, which could reflect
 residual airways component of infection.  No new areas of consolidation have
 developed in the remainder of the lungs, and note is made of a very small
 right pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essential resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia with residual
 linear atelectasis/scarring as well as mild bronchial wall thickening.
