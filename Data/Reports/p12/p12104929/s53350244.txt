                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lethargy, cough and hallucinations.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are clear of consolidation or pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Trace blunting of posterior costophrenic angles may be
 due to trace effusions.  Tortuosity and calcification of the ectatic thoracic
 aorta is again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and notable
 for a dual-lead pacing device and mild cardiomegaly.  Diffuse osteopenia is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
