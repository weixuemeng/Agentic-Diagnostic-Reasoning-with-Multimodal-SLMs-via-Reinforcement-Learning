                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 Compared with ___ at 13:30 p.m., there is new atelectasis at the left
 base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is marked
 cardiomegaly, with A densely calcified tortuous aorta and areas of aneurysmal
 dilatation of the aorta. A pacemaker is in place, lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is severe background emphysema.  There are
 small bilateral effusions, with uderlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Right paratracheal calcified lymph nodes noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Small bilateral effusions, considerably larger than on ___, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The possibility of an underlying
 pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.  The mid and upper zones are grossly
 clear except for some right mid zone atelectasis. 
  
 2) Cardiomegaly; densely calcified, tortuous aorta; and areas of aneurysmal
 enlargement of the aorta are grossly unchanged.  No CHF.
