                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Increased somnolence at home.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two images were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There is a pacemaker in situ.  There is extensive unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta with calcification within the aorta, tracheobronchial tree, with a right
 paratracheal node.
 
 The patchy atelectasis previously identified as well as the pleural effusions
 are probably slightly improved, although with the difference in technique,
 direct comparison is somewhat difficult.  There is certainly no significant
 worsening.  There is no good evidence of an acute infiltrate.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No definitive acute findings.
