                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable semi-erect chest radiographs were obtained.  NG tube
 passes into the stomach and extends inferiorly out of the field of view.  A
 right-sided PICC line has been pulled back into the axillary vein.  Low lung
 volumes and extensive bilateral left greater than right alveolar opacities are
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube below the diaphragm.
 2.  Right-sided PICC line has been pulled back to the right axillary vein.
 3.  The predominant pattern of stable left greater than right diffuse alveolar
 opacities indicates moderate CHF.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
