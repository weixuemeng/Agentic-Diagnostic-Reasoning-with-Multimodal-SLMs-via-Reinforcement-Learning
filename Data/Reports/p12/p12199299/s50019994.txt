  junction can advance 5-10 cm. Bibasal opacities could reflect atelectasis

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Transferred from outside hospital, intubated.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 Prior study available for comparison is ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  ET tube tip is low, 1.5 cm above the
 carina, can be withdraw couple of centimeters for more standard position.  NG
 tube tip is in the stomach, but the side hole is at the EG junction and should
 be advanced for more standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Left perihilar and lower lobe opacities are worrisome
 for aspiration given the clinical concern.  There is mild vascular congestion.
 There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 8:10 p.m. on ___.
