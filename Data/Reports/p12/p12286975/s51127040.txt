                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of diabetes, now with nausea and vomiting.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable image was obtained.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Subtle right
 base opacity is likely atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting,
 mild infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  Subtle right base opacity is likely
 atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting, early infection or
 aspiration is not excluded.  PA and lateral views if patient able, may be
 helpful for further evaluation.
