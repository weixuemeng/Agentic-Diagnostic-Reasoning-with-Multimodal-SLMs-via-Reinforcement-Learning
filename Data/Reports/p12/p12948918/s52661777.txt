                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and congestion.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Patient body habitus leads to mild underpenetration at the lung bases.
 Otherwise, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
