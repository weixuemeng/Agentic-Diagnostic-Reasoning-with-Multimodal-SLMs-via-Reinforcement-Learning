 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube is now coiled within the moderate to large hiatal hernia.
 There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  There is persistent moderate
 perihilar edema and patchy bibasilar opacities. Aeration of the right base is
 improved, and the enlarged cardiac silhouette appears slightly less prominent
 compared to prior studies.  Subsequent radiographs available at the time of
 this interpretation demonstrate a repositioned enteric tube within the distal
 stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube is coiled within a moderate-to-large hiatal hernia.
 2. Improvement in right base aeration.
 3. Persistent moderate perihilar edema and patchy bibasilar opacities.
