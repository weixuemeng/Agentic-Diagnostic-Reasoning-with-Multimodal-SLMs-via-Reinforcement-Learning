                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall with neck pain, on coumadin
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears top normal.  Rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures is noted as result of volume loss in the right lower lobe.  Right
 lower lobe central mass resulting in a right lower lobe patchy opacity, likely
 postobstructive atelectasis, is noted, but better visualized on the previous
 CT.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without new focal consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Soft tissue calcifications are seen within the left chest wall.
 Degenerative changes with anterior osteophyte formation is noted in the
 thoracic spine.  No acute fractures are clearly seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central right lower lobe mass resulting in postobstructive atelectasis in the
 right lower lobe again visualized, but better seen on the previous chest CT. 
 No new focal consolidation.  No displaced fractures.
