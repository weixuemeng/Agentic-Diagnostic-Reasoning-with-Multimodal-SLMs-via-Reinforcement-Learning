 Tracheostomy tube is identified in proper position. There are bilateral
 parenchymal opacities with most dense consolidation at the left lung base and
 left mid lung but also seen at the right lung base. There may be a component
 of left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal for
 technique and positioning. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

 Bilateral parenchymal opacities, left greater than right, could represent
 multifocal infection/aspiration, edema or hemorrhage, among others given
