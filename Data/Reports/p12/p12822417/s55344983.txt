                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.6 cm
 from the carina. An enteric tube tip and side port are within the stomach. 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the confluence
 of the brachiocephalic veins. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No acutely
 displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.
 3. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
