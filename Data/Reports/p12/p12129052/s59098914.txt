 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, MRA chest ___, CTA

 cannot be excluded. Small right effusion is noted on the lateral view.  The
 right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Median sternotomy wires are again noted. 
 Previously fractured inferior most sternotomy wire is noted, now with a second
 fracture of the same wire. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 consolidation not excluded. 
 2.  Fractured inferior median sternotomy wire, progressed since the prior
 radiograph with a second fracture of the same wire now present.
