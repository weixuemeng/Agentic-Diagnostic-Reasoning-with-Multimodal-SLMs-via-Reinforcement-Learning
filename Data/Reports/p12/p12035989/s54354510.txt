                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable mild to moderate cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Small to moderate right and small
 left pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent areas of bibasilar
 atelectasis and or consolidation, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely represent atelectasis, but followup radiographs may be
 helpful to exclude coexisting pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
