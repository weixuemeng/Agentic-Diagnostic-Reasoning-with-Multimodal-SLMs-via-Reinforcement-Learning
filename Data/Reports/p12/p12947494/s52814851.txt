                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress with hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to patient's inability to cooperate.  The left
 hemidiaphragm appears elevated of unknown chronicity.  Increased opacities are
 noted overlying the left mid lung and may be representative of an infectious
 process in the proper clinical setting.  The right hemithorax is clear.  Aorta
 appears somewhat tortuous.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to patient positioning demonstrates increased opacities
 overlying the left mid lung which may represent an infectious process in the
 proper clinical setting or atelectasis.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity.
