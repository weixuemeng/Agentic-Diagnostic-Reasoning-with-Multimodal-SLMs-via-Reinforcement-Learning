                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with paraesophageal hernia and translocation of
 pancreas and pleural effusions into thoracic cavity now with worsening air
 hunger and SOB  // worsening translocation or pleural effusions?     worsening
 translocation or pleural effusions?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been little change in the appearance of the chest since ___
 when chest CT showed marked compromise of left lung volume by a moderate to
 large left pleural effusion and the very large diaphragmatic hernia
 transmitting a large volume of abdominal contents.  Atelectasis is more severe
 in the right lower lung, probably by virtue of mediastinal displacement from
 the hernia contents.  With a persistent though smaller pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is obscured by adjacent structures.
 
 Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and edema is mild.  No pneumothorax.
