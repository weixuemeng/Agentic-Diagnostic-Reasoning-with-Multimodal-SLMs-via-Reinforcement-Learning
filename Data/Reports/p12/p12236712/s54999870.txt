 left pleural effusion and atelectasis in what has been a lung compromised by
 massive hiatus hernia.  The hollow viscus in the left upper abdominal
 quadrant, presumably the stomach, is substantially more dilated with air and
 fluid today than it was on ___.  Upper enteric drainage tube does not
 really enter the structure and probably terminates at the gastroesophageal

 jugular line ends low in the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
