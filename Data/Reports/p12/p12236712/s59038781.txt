                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post hiatal hernia repair and a repair of
 esophageal perforation.  A nasogastric tube remains in place, with the tip
 terminating in the expected location of the stomach, and the sideport is
 proximal to this level, just below the level of the carina.  Tip of left PICC
 is at junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, but does not make the
 typical downward course within the SVC. Stable post-operative appearance of
 cardiomediastinal contours, and slight decrease in severity of left
 hemidiaphragm elevation.  Small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated. 
 Interval improvement in bibasilar atelectasis with residual left lower lobe
 atelectasis remaining.  Drains are present adjacent to the operative site.
