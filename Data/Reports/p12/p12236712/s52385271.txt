                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diphram herniation  // NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___ at ___ min past midnight.  Targeted review
 of chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube has been placed.  The tip overlies what is thought to represent the
 lower right lung and does not clearly pass beyond the GE junction.  The NG
 tube lies to the right of midline along its entire course.  The patient's
 anatomy is atypical.  Allowing for this, it is unlikely that this NG tube has
 passed into the stomach.
 
 Extensive background abnormalities are similar to the prior film, allowing for
 differences in the patient positioning.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
