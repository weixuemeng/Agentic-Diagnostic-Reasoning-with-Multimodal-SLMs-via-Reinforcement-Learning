 acute process, fluid overload, worsening mass effect
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these earlier study of this date, there is little overall
 change.  Large diaphragmatic hernia and extensive pleural effusion on the left
 are again seen with extremely low lung volumes.  Displacement of the
 mediastinum to the right the is again seen, where there appears to be a
 smaller pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette cannot be precisely seen due
 to the previously mentioned abnormalities.
 Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some element of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
