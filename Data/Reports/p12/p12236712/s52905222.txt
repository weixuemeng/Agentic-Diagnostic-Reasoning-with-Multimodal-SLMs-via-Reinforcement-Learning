                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute pancreatitis ___ to herniation
 through paraesophageal hernia  // eval for mediastinal shift, PTX, pneumonia,
 effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Even allowing for small amount of the patient rotation, the trachea and carina
 appear displaced to the right.  The mediastinal borders are not well-defined
 due to parenchymal changes in both lungs.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 with underlying gas.  The significance of this speckled gas seen in this area
 is uncertain.  There is a probable small left effusion.  Patchy opacity in the
 right mid and lower zones is noted and the possibility of a small effusion
 cannot be excluded.  The presence of consolidation would be quite difficult to
 assess in this setting.  There is upper zone redistribution, suggesting an
 element of CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Parenchymal opacities in both lungs, obscuring the mediastinum, but there
 is suggestion of considerable rightward shift of the mediastinum.
 2. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
 3. CHF and small effusions are likely present.
 4. The possibility of underlying consolidation would be difficult to exclude
 in this setting.  If clinically indicated, chest CT may help for further
 assessment.
