                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post hiatal hernia repair, hx of esophageal perforation
 with contained leak.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to esophagram dated ___, and
 chest radiograph dated both ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube remains in place, the tip seen terminating in
 the expected location of the stomach. Left PICC line terminating at the
 junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, but without the expected
 downward course.  As compared to the prior examination, there are now two
 air-fluid levels seen overlying the left lower lung, consistent with barium
 from a previous esophagram filling the intrathoracic stomach and likely an
 additional loop of bowel.  There is no overt intrathoracic leak of contrast
 identified, although this would be better evaluated by a fluoroscopic study. 
 Stable postoperative appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Drains
 are again noted overlying the operative site.
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ by telephone at 11:52
 a.m. on ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
