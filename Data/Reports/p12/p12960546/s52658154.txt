                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:50 A.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after core valve replacement.  Chest tube for
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions have increased on the left, not on the right.  Mild-to-moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  No endotracheal tube is seen
 above the upper margin of the clavicles, which is the superior margin of this
 film.
 
 A right jugular Swan-Ganz line ends in the proximal right pulmonary artery. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses and the right upper pleural drain is unchanged in position. 
 With the exception of the most extreme lung apices, they are excluded from the
 study, pleural surfaces do not show pneumothorax.
