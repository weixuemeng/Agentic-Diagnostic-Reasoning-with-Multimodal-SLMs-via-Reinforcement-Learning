                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV rectal cancer, new fever and rising white count, question
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 There is kyphotic positioning.  An indwelling right-sided catheter is present,
 with tip over mid/lower SVC.  The upper portion of spinal fixation hardware is
 noted.  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 unchanged.  Opacity adjacent to the right heart border is consistent with
 projection from the patient's known spinal metastasis.  There is a small left
 effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and some atelectasis at
 the right lung base. Possible tiny right effusion.  No CHF.  The mid and upper
 zones of the lung are clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate in this location cannot be excluded.  
 
 2) Probable atelectasis at the right base, but attention to this area on
 followup films is recommended.
