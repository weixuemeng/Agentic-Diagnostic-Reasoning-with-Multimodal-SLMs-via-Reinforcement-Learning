  No pneumoperitoneum identified. Costophrenic angles are blunted, possibly
  representing small effusions. Multiple known pulmonary metastatic nodules are
  better assessed on the recent chest CT. Large retrocardiac density is
  consistent with a known large paraspinal metastases.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, a pre-existing left pleural effusion has
 almost completely cleared.  The right lung base is also more transparent than
 on the previous radiograph. The vertebral stabilization devices and the right
 Port-A-Cath are in constant position.  Mild cardiomegaly and paravertebral
 consolidations, caused by known soft tissue components of the spinal process,
 are unchanged.
