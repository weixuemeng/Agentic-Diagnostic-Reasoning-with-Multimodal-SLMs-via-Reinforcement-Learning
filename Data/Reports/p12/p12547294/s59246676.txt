                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right brachial PICC status post a MVC now with pain at the PICC
 site, evaluate for PICC placement and rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  A right-sided internal
 jugular central catheter is present and terminates in the distal SVC.  A
 butterfly shaped opacity projects over the posterior portion of the right ___
 rib and has moved more medial compared to prior.  While this is likely
 external to the patient and related to the central line, its exact location
 cannot be determined.
 
 The lung volumes are low which results in vascular crowding.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  The imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  There is no displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1.  Satisfactorily positioned right internal jugular central
 catheter.  2.  No displaced rib fracture.  If concern for a fracture persists,
 a dedicated rib series with markers would be of utility.
