                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with Port-A-Catheter, unable to draw blood for
 labs.  Evaluate for location of the tip of the central catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and CT chest on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, but there are no focal opacities. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A Port-A-Cath catheter is noted with the port in
 the right thorax and the tip in unchanged position in the lower SVC.  However,
 a disruption is noted at the proximal end of the catheter at its connection
 with the port which appears new from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  New ill visualized
 abnormality at the level of the connection between the catheter and the port
 might represent a disruption at this site. A shallow oblique view might allow
 better visualization of this area.
