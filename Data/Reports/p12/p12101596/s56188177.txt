                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement, evaluation of the patient after
 aortic valve replacement.
 
 AP radiograph of the abdomen as well as AP radiograph of the chest were
 reviewed.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Interval development of interstitial edema
 is demonstrated.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Assessment of the abdomen,
 still partial, reveals no evidence of bowel dilatation.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema is prominent and
 reassessment of the patient after diuresis is recommended.
