 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yoF w/ COPD/asthma (2L NC at home), breast cancer (s/p
 mastectomy), pAF/tachybrady syndrome, who is being transferred from ___

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits normal or
 mildly enlarged and there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure
 with small effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases.  Left subclavian
 pacer is in place with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle.  No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.
 Suggestion of more coalescent area of opacification at the right base could
 reflect developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
 There are surgical clips in the left axillary region, consistent with the
 clinical history of prior mastectomy.
