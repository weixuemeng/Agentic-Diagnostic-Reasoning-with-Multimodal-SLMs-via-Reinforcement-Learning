                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with metastatic non-small cell cancer
 with pleural effusion.  Status post thoracocentesis, evaluate for recurrence
 of the pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post right upper lobe central mass
 with metallic biopsy marker and plate atelectasis unchanged.  Same holds for
 the moderate elevation of the right-sided diaphragm.  The right-sided lateral
 pleural sinus remains blunted.  Heart size is unchanged and unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta.  Left-sided hemithorax, normal pulmonary
 appearance as before.  Frontal and lateral views are compared with specific
 attention to the amount of pleural density on the right base.  Comparison made
 both on frontal and lateral view suggests a mild increase of the pleural
 density but hardly enough to warrant renewed thoracocentesis.  It is therefore
 suggested to perform another followup examination with somewhat longer time
 interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, slight progression of right-sided pleural
 effusion is suggested.
