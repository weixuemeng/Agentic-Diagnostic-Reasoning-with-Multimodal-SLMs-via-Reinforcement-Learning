                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of non-small cell lung cancer status post radiation and
 surgery with chronic pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___, chest CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with known right
 hilar soft tissue mass, better evaluated on recent CT examination. Increased
 septal markings throughout the right lung likely represents lymphangitic
 spread of tumor.  A right Pleurx catheter remains in place with its tip
 terminating medially along the paramedian pleura without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Remaining right pleural effusion is improved and small. 
 Post-radiation fibrosis and post-op volume loss in the right lung is
 unchanged.  Left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right Pleurx catheter remains in place with mild decrease in
 right pleural effusion without evidence of pneumothorax.
