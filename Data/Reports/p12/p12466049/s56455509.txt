 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral portable upright chest radiograph obtained.  There
 is basilar atelectasis, more noted along the left lung base.  There is no
 convincing sign of pneumonia though the more localized atelectasis in the left
 lung base may obscure subtle pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No overt signs of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  Bilateral AC joint arthropathy is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis, cannot exclude subtle pneumonia at the left
 lung base.
