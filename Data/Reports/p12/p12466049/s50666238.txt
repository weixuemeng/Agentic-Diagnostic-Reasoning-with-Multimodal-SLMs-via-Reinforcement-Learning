 unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but this is improved
 compared to the prior study.  No definite pleural effusions are seen.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect
 atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved compared to the most recent exam,
 and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
