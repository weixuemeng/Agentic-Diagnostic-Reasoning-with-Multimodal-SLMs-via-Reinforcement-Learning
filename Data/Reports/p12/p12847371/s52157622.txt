 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:45 PM
  Mild pulmonary vascular prominence and irregularity, likely partially chronic,
  with mild cardiomegaly. Focus of increased opacity over the right lower lung
  field, which is non-specific and could represent atelectasis, early infection,
  conglomerate of enlarged vessels, or possibly an ill-defined mass. Repeat
  radiograph to evaluate for short-interval change or CT could be performed for
  further evaluation. Findings discussed with ___ by phone at 8:40
  p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with CKD, nausea, vomiting, ___-pound weight loss, concern
 for malignancy, rule out intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 Right lower lung opacity is superimposed to a rib and is not seen on the
 lateral view : it is probably not in the lungs.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Mild cephalization of pulmonary vessel is mostly compatible with mild
 volume overload.  The cardiac contour is top normal and the aorta is tortuous.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1. There is no finding suspicious for malignancy.
 2. Volume overload is mild.
 3. Small right lower thorax density is seen only in one view: it is probably a
 rib related-opacity and not a lung lesion.
