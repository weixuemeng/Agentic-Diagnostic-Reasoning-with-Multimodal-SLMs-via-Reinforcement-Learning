                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.  Chest CT of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right medial lung base
 opacity is not appreciably changed since ___, and remains
 compatible with right middle lobe atelectasis.  The heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No new consolidation.  Persistent right middle lobe atelectasis.  As
 previously recommended, given persistent volume loss, chest CT is suggested
 for further evaluation.
