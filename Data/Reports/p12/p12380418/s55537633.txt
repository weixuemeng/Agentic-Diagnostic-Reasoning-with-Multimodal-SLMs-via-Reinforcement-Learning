                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with 2 weeks of productive cough and treated with
 Zithromax and common still symptomatic, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, there has been no
 change.  Again seen is hazy opacity obscuring the right heart border which on
 the lateral view is compatible with right middle lobe atelectasis.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs remain clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent right middle lobe opacity suggestive of atelectasis with similar
 configuration.  No new consolidation.  Given the persistent volume loss, CT
 scan should be considered to look for obstructing lesion in the airway.
