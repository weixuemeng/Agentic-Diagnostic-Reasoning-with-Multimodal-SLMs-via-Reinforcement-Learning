                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Systolic heart failure, history of PE, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, chest CT
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size remains normal.  Widening of the upper mediastinum is
 stable and is accounted for by mediastinal fat as seen on chest CT from
 ___. Increasing indentation on the left upper trachea at the
 level of the clavicles may reflect new pathology in the left thyroid lobe,
 which appears hypertrophied on the prior chest CT.  Left pleural effusion is
 small if present.  There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.  There
 is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Pulmonary vessels appear
 slightly more engorged, but there is no overt edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation or large effusions.
 2.  Increased focal indentation on the left upper trachea in the upper
 mediastinum, which may reflect thyroid pathology.  This should be evaluated in
 light of clinical findings, and thyroid ultrasound may be obtained for further
 evaluation.
