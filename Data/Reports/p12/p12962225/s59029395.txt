 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and chest CTA on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.

 crowding, more conspicuous in the lower lobes.  Allowing for these
 limitations, the lungs are clear without focal opacities.  Cardiac size is top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
