                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated for hypercarbic resp failure  //
 eval interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widening of cardiomediastinal contours is similar to ___ chest
 radiograph but markedly increased compared to a baseline outside radiograph of
 ___.  Although possibly reflecting a combination of vascular
 distension and accentuation by portable supine technique, the possibility of
 mediastinal hemorrhage or mass is also possible.  Interval worsening of left
 retrocardiac opacification, most likely due to a combination of atelectasis
 and pleural effusion although coexisting infection is possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
