                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Tissue CT dated ___ at approximately 18:03
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Images are poorly penetrated.  Cardiac borders are not well defined though
 heart size is likely enlarged.  Vascular congestion is present with enlarged
 azygous vein.  There is no pneumothorax.  Probable small pleural effusions are
 if likely present.  Mediastinal widening is likely due to a combination of
 vascular engorgement and mediastinal fat deposition.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and small pleural effusions.  When
 the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs are
 recommended to better assess mediastinal widening.
