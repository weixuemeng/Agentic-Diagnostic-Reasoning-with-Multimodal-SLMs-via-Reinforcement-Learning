                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and today with hemoptysis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.
 Bronchovascular crowding in the lung somewhat limits evaluation though
 allowing for this, there are increased peribronchovascular markings which
 could reflect the presence of an atypical pulmonary infection.  No lobar
 consolidation.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar congestion difficult
 to exclude.  No overt signs of edema.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size difficult
 to assess given low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contour is grossly unchanged. 
 Aortic calcifications at the knob noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
