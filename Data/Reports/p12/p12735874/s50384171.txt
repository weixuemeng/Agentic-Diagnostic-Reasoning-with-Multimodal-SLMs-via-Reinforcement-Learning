                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic
 arch is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A new band-like opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring in
 the lingula.  Otherwise, lungs remain clear.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
