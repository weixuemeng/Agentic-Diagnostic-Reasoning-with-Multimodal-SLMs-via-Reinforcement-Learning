                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of CKD and hypertension with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Subtle reticulation at the lung bases was seen previously in a
 similar distribution.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Pleural surfaces are
 clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle reticulation at the lung bases appears identical to prior examinations,
 likely representing trace interstitial edema.
