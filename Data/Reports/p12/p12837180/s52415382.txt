                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough after exposure to dust from bird dropping.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso dated ___.  Chest radiograph, last
 performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are appropriate.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen in the lungs.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size.  The mediastinum is slightly prominent due to moderate
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but is otherwise within normal limits. 
 Prominence of the right hilar contours most likely reflect dilated vessels, as
 seen on the prior CT on ___, and suggests underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Prominent hilar contours bilaterally may reflect dilated vessels, seen on
 prior CT, related to underlying pulmonary hypertension.
