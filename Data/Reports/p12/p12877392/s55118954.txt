                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Again noted is a left pacemaker with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as expected. There is no
 pneumothorax. There is a small right pleural effusion with atelectasis. 
 Underlying consolidation at the right lung base cannot be excluded.  There is
 no left pleural effusion.  Slight increase in interstitial markings diffusely
 may represent interstitial edema versus an atypical infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right pleural effusion with atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation at the
 right lung base cannot be excluded.  
 
 2.  Slightly increased interstitial markings, which may represent interstitial
 edema versus atypical infection.
