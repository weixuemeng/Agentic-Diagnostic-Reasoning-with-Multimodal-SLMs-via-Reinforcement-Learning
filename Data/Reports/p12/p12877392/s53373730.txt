                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, reportedly having a
 "urgently abnormal" chest radiograph at an outside institution.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs
 which are grossly clear.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.  The pulmonary arteries are slightly large, suggestive of pulmonary
 hypertension.  Cardiomegaly is again seen, which is stable.  Some fine
 interstitial markings near the right costophrenic angle could be indicative of
 a chronic very mild interstitial edema, but there is no evidence of active
 disease at this time on this exam.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  A pacer is seen
 with intact leads along the expected course to the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pulmonary or cardiac pathology.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.
 
 These findings were made at 5:01 p.m. on ___ and communicated by
 telephone to Dr. ___ at 5:07 p.m. on the same day.
