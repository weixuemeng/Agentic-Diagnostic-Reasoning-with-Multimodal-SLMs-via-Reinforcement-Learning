                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  An enteric tube courses below the
 left hemidiaphragm with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Right
 internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears slightly withdrawn,
 terminating in the upper SVC.  New extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen
 throughout the chest wall and neck.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Hilar contours are similar.  There is again likely small bilateral
 pleural effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities.  Assessment for
 pneumothorax is limited on this supine exam.  There appear to be new fractures
 of the right fourth and fifth ribs anteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the neck and chest.  New right
 fourth and fifth rib fractures anteriorly.
 2. Enteric and endotracheal tubes in standard positions.  Right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip has been slightly withdrawn, with tip now
 in the upper SVC.
 3. Continued layering bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
 opacities.
