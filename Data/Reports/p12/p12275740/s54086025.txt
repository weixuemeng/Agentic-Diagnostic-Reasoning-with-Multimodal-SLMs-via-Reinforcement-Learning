                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated transfer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the lung bases is limited as this area was not completely
 included in the exam.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses within the region of the esophagus, though the distal
 aspect is not well visualized.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter
 tip is in the low SVC.  Heart size is normal.  Aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Hazy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect layering
 pleural effusions, small to moderate in size.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube is noted within the esophagus, but the distal aspect is not
 well visualized.  Consider repeat views of the lower chest and upper abdomen
 to detect the position of the tip of the enteric tube.
 3. Small to moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 opacities, likely atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  Please note
 that the lung bases in their entirety were not included in the exam.
