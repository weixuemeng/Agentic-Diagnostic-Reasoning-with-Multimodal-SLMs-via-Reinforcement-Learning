                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea on exertion while walking.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  The previously seen PICC is no longer seen.  There
 is partially imaged hardware in the right humerus, not well evaluated;
 however, there may be lucency around the proximal portion.  Findings could be
 due to hardware loosening, infection not excluded.
