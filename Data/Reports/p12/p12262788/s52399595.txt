                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage, evaluate
 for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is an endotracheal tube with tip in satisfactory position.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen with tip terminating in the distal esophagus.  This
 tip does not course below the level of the diaphragm and should be advanced. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  There are
 bibasilar opacities seen which likely reflect aspiration versus pneumonia. 
 There are perihilar opacities that reflect underlying edema.  Heart size is
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Degenerative change
 within the thoracic spine that is moderate in severity is noted.  There is
 partial visualization of a right humeral prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube.
 
 2.  NG tube terminating in distal esophagus, this should be advanced to the
 stomach.
 
 3.  Bibasilar opacities reflecting aspiration versus infection.
