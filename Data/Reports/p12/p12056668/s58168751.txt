                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with bilateral pleural effusions, status
 post tap on the right side, now evaluate for pneumothorax post chest tube
 removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  In the interval, the right-sided pigtail end
 drainage catheter in the lower pleural space has been removed.  Aeration of
 the lung is unchanged and no evidence of increasing pleural effusion is
 present.  Again, however, a small up to 2 cm wide apical pneumothorax cavity
 persists.  No other new abnormalities.  Left-sided pleural effusion persists
 and is seen to extend in the posterior pleural space as well as identified on
 a lateral view in sitting position.
