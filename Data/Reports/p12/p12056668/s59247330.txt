                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post hiatal hernia repair with lots
 of crepitus, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 835.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film on ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina.  Right subclavian
 PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC.  There has been interval
 appearance of extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  There continues to be
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with lucency beneath it likely
 corresponding to distended bowel.  No definite pneumothorax is seen on this
 supine film, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.  There are likely small layering effusions and
 bibasilar patchy opacity which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Followup imaging in the upright or semi-erect position may be helpful to
 exclude an underlying pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
