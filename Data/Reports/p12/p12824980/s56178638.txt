                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric pain, dizziness  // r/o ich,
 infiltrate, cholecystitis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are unchanged, particularly prominence of
 the superior right mediastinum which is likely due to tortuosity of the
 brachiocephalic vessels.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.  Calcific densities
 are again seen at the left glenohumeral joint, likely representing loose
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
