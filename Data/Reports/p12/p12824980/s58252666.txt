                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and back pain, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No acute focal
 pneumonia.  A prominence of the superior mediastinum to the right most likely
 represents tortuosity of the brachiocephalic vessels.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  There is displacement of the lower
 cervical trachea to the right, consistent with a thyroid mass.  Extensive
 hypertrophic spurring is seen in the thoracic spine.  Several opacifications
 projected over just glenoid portion of the left shoulder are consistent with
 free joint bodies.
