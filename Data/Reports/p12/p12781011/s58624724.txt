 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with blocked NGT  // evaluate NGT position     
 evaluate NGT position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the nasogastric tube extends at least
 to the lower body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image.  There is suggestions that it may extend to the antrum and and her of
 on itself backwards.  If the precise position of the tube is of clinical
 importance, an abdominal image could be obtained.
 The cardiac silhouette is stable.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Hazy
 opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle
 suggests layering pleural effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis.
