 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF with new oxygen requirement  //
 concern for pneumonia      concern for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is some additional prominence
 of engorged and indistinct vessels, consistent with increasing pulmonary
 edema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with small effusions
 and adjacent atelectasis.  There is asymmetry at the base with more
 opacification on the right.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 represent developing pneumonia.
