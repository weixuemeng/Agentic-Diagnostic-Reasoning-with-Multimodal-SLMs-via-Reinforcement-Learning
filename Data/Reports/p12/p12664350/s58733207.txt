                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is somewhat increased opacification of the right costophrenic sulcus
 with elevation and flattening which may reflect scarring or atelectasis
 associated with a small persistent pleural effusion, but this appearance is
 unlikely to reflect an acute process.  To some extent, this opacification was
 present on the prior examination, although less prominent.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 A patchy focal opacity projecting over the right upper lobe suggests minor
 scarring which is unchanged.  An oval nodular focus projecting over the left
 lower lung probably is due to a nipple shadow.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No definite evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, more prominent, probably a
 chronic finding.  
 
 3.  Oval nodular focus suggesting a nipple shadow projecting over the left
 side, although hard to confirm since it was not visible on the prior study. 
 When clinically appropriate evaluation with an additional PA view using nipple
 markers is suggested.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ on ___, at 2
 pm by telephone.
