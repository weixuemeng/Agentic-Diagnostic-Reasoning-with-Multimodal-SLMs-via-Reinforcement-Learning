                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is patchy new opacification of the right upper lobe most
 consistent with bronchopneumonia.  A band-like opacity in the lingula suggests
 minor atelectasis or scarring which is similar to less conspicuous. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.  A PICC line has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New extensive right upper lobe opacification most consistent with
 pneumonia.
