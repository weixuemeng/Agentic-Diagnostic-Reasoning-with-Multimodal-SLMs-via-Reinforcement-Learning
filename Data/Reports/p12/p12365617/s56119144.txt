 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 18:58
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hemoptysis, question etiology.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 18:58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided pacemaker is in place with a single lead terminating over the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  There are patchy and streaky
 opacities at both lung bases, which are nonspecific and could reflect areas of
 atelectasis, although the differential would also include post-inflammatory
 scarring or residual changes from pulmonary hemorrhage.  An acute infectious
 process also cannot be entirely excluded.  Therefore, comparison to remote
 studies should be considered.  If prior chest films are not available, further
 imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful especially as the patient has
 hemoptysis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  No large
 effusions.
