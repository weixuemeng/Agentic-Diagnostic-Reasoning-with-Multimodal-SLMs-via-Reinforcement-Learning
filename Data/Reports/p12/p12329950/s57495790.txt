                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with PSVT.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Patchy region of opacity identified at the left lung base. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is noted. 
 Partially visualized apparently chronic deformity of the proximal right
 humerus is also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be entirely excluded and please correlate clinically. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.  If desired, PA and lateral could
 be obtained to further characterize.
