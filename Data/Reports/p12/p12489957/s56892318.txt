  1. Fractures of the left lateral sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs.
  
  2. On the background of emphysema, cardiomegaly, and fluid overload there are
  coarse interstitial markings and patchy opacities in the right lung which may
  represent a combination of interstitial lung disease with overlapping
  infectious/inflammatory process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute change in mental status and hypoxia.
 Evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, compatible with emphysema. There is bilateral
 upper vascular redistribution and hilar engorgement suggesting fluid overload.
 Coarse interstitial thickening some patchy opacities in the right lung are
 conspicuous. There are bilateral small pleural effusions. There is no
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is present.
 
 Fractures of the left lateral sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs are identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Fractures of the left lateral sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs.
 
 2. On the background of emphysema, cardiomegaly, and fluid overload there are
 coarse interstitial markings and patchy opacities in the right lung which may
 represent a combination of asymmetric interstitial edema with overlapping
 infectious/inflammatory process.
