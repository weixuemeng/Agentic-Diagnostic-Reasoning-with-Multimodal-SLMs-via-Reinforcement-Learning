                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor, heart size is normal. 
 No focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no
 pleural effusions.  Multiple rib deformities are unchanged and likely relate
 to congenital fusion anomalies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
