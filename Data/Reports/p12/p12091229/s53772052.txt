                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased oxygen saturation and altered mental status.  Evaluation
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not well evaluated secondary to effusions and bilateral
 atelectasis.  Consolidation at the left lung base is compatible with
 aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac
 opacity, which could be compatible with aspiration.
