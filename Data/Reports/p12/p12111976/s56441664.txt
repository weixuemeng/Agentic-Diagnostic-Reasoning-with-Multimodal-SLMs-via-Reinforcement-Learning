                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, for baseline before new medication.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change.  There is
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular
 congestion.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is also seen.  Discordance suggests
 cardiomyopathy or possibly pericardial effusion.
 
 Evidence of previous cardiac surgery with a pacer device extending to the
 region of the apex of the right ventricle.
