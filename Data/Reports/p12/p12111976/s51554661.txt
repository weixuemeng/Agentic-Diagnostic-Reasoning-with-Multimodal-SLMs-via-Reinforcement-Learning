                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with COPD presenting with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An ICD generator overlies the left chest wall.  The
 single-lead is intact with the tip projecting over the expected position of
 the right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact on the single
 frontal view.  There is increased opacification of the medial right lung base,
 which could reflect early developing pneumonia and/or focal congestion.  There
 is no overt interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the medial right lung base may be due to early
 pneumonia and/or congestion.
