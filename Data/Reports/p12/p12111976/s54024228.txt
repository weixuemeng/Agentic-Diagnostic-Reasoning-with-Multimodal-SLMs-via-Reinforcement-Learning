                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recurrent ventricular tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided AICD
 device is again noted with leads terminating in the region of the right
 ventricle, unchanged.  Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged, and there is mild pulmonary edema perhaps minimally improved in the
 interval.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, without new focal consolidation present.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is again seen.  A pleural base mass within the left
 apex with osseous involvement and pathologic fracture of the left third rib
 laterally is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, perhaps minimally improved in
 the interval.
