                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 descends along the thoracic midline beyond the GE junction though the tip is
 not included in the imaged field.  The heart appears top-normal in size. 
 There is hilar congestion without frank edema.  CP angles are excluded
 bilaterally limiting assessment.  There is subtle lower lung opacity which
 could represent layering fluid and or atelectasis/pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube positioned high in the trachea, consider advancement by 2-3 cm for
 more optimal positioning.  NG tube appears to extend beyond the GE junction
 though tip not visualized.
 2. Mild hilar congestion, likely small bilateral pleural effusions and lower
 lung opacity concerning for atelectasis versus pneumonia/aspiration.
