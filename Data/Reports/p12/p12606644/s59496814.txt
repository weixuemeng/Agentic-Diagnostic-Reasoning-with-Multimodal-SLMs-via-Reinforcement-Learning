 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of joint pain, baseline chest x-ray before methotrexate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 minimally decreased, likely because of a lesser inspiratory effort.  No lung
 parenchymal changes are seen on the chest x-ray.  In particular, there is no
 evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.  No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
