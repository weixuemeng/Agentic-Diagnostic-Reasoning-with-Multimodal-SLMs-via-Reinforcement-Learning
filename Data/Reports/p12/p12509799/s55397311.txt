                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion s/p CABG, here for followup. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with
 the tip in the upper-to-mid SVC.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with prior
 CABG surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and increased in size
 from ___.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present on the right greater than the
 left.  There is no pulmonary edema.  A radiolucent area in the right lateral
 cardiophrenic angle may represent a small loculated pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left.
 2.  Increased size of cardiac silhouette from ___ likely reflects
 postoperative change.
 3.  Possible small, loculated right basilar pneumothorax.
