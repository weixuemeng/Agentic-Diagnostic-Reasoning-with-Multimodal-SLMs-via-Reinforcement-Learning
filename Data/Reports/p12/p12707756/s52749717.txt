                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of hypothyroidism, depression, who is presenting
 one day history of shortness of breath and intermittent jaw pain found to have
 3VD (___% mLAD with disease in D1 as well, ___% mCx, ___% mRCA) with no PCI
 performed and severe mitral regurgitation.  // febrile to 103, please assess
 for consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, there has been
 slight worsening of bilateral pulmonary opacities.  Areas of more confluent
 opacity in the right mid and both lower lungs could potentially be due to
 asymmetrical edema but coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the
 setting of fever.  No other relevant change.
