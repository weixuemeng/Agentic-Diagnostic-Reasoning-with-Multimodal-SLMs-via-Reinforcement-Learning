                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 7:54AM
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG with acute on chronic KI and high
 oxygen requirement, assess pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 7:54 am is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter and left basilar chest tube are
 unchanged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable
 cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There continues to be retrocardiac
 consolidation with an associated pleural effusion most consistent with
 compressive atelectasis.  More patchy opacity at the right base likely
 reflects layering fluid with minimal associated atelectasis.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
