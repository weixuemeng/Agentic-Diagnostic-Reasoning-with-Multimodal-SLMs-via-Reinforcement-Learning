                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 Nodular opacity seen on the lateral view anteriorly is not clearly seen on the
 previous examination.  Although it might reflect summation of shadows, given
 its new character, assessment of the patient with chest CT is recommended.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary edema is
 present.
