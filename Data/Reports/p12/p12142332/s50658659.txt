                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with resp distress  // please evaluate for acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates mild cardiomegaly. 
 Opacity at the left lung base is present as is streaky opacity at the right
 lung base.  While findings may reflect sequela of atelectasis, infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded.  There is mild central vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax. There is
 no large pleural effusion, of the left costophrenic angle partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities which may be atelectatic in etiology although infectious
 process is not entirely excluded.  Minimal central vascular engorgement
 without overt pulmonary edema.
