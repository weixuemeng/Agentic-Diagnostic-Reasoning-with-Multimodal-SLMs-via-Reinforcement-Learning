                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pancreatic cancer, possible PE with
 hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, assess for edema or effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC.  There is an
 increasing left-sided layering pleural effusion with associated airspace
 opacity at the left base likely representing partial lower lobe collapse. 
 Right lung is low in volume with patchy opacity at the base likely reflecting
 patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess as the left heart border is
 obscured by the near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
