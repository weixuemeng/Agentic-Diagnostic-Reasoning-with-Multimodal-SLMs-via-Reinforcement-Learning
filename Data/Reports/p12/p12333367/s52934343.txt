                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 mildly prominent, but unchanged and probably compatible with a normal variant.
 Mild unfolding of thoracic aorta is also similar.  There is minimal relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity at the left lung base is
 compatible with minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
