 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pulmonary edema has
 completely cleared.  Lung volumes have essentially increased, likely
 reflecting improved inspiration.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
