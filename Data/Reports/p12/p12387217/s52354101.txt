                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright radiograph of the chest was reviewed in
 comparison to prior radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two right chest tubes end near the lung apex whereas the third is
 located at the right lung base.  Minimal opacities in the upper lung and lung
 base represent either mild edema following drainage of loculated pleural
 effusion or atelectasis or could be pneumonia, and requires attention on
 follow up radiograph. Mild left lower lung atelectasis is stable.  The heart
 size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
