                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman with right sternoclavicular joint empyema
 status post debridement, assess for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well expanded.  Heart appears normal in size and
 configuration.  Trachea is midline.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Again an opacity is noted projecting over the anterior first
 rib on the right at the level of the sternal notch, which appears to be
 unchanged from the prior study.  This likely represents changes associated
 with the empyema and the subsequent debridement. There is also minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle possibly representing small effusion
 or atelectasis, which was also seen on the prior radiograph.  No significant
 pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear to be intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant changes since the prior study ___ ___.
