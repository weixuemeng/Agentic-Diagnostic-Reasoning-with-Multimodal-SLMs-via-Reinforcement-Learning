                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Osteomyelitis with debridement of sternoclavicular joint.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in appearance of the ill-defined region of opacification projecting
 over the anterior first rib on the right, most likely consistent with the
 empyema and subsequent debridement.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 persists, consistent with effusion, atelectasis, or both.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.
