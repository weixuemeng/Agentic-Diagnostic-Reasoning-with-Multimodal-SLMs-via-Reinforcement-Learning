                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following right chest tube removal, there is a suggestion of a
 small loculated hydropneumothorax anteriorly in the retrosternal region on the
 lateral view.  Small right pleural effusion appears similar to the prior
 study.  Right middle and lower lobe opacity suggestive of atelectasis appears
 slightly worse compared to the prior study, and there is a questionable new
 area of opacity at the junction of the right first rib and right clavicle
 which could either represent superimposition of osseous structures or a new
 lung abnormality.  Attention to this region on short-term followup radiograph
 may be helpful.
