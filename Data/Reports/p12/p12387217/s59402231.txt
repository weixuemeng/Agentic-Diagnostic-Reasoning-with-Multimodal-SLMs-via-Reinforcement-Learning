                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Question pneumonia, assess for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are seen with clear left lung.  In the right
 hemithorax, the lobulated apical pleural contour likely reflects a loculated
 pleural effusion with accompanying moderate-to-large right dependent pleural
 effusion and associated atelectasis. Supervening pneumonia cannot be fully
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion with apical loculated component. 
 Cannot exclude underlying pneumonia. Please refer to subsequent Chest CT for
 further evaluation.
