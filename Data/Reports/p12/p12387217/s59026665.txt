                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with lump over right pec, rule out mass.
 
 FINDINGS: There is a comparision from ___ and CT from ___.
 Evidence of the previously right pleural effusion with loculated component
 superiorly is again seen in the right upper and right lower lobe, however the
 right upper lobe opacity seems to have increased in size. This could be a
 reaccumulation of fluid. There is also soft evidence that the anterior
 thoracic wall is mildy more prominent than the earlier exam. This could
 correlated to the soft tissue mass felt on the patient's chest, although
 radiograph is a poor test for this.  Left lung is essentially clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
