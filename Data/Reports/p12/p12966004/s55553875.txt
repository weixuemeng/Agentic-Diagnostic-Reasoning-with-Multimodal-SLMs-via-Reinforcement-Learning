                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PE, status post PEA arrest, hypothermia protocol.  Assess for
 edema or infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube terminates within the body of the stomach.  Right internal jugular
 catheter ends in the lower SVC.  Previously described right upper lung opacity
 is less conspicuous than on the prior.  Bibasilar opacities are larger and
 could reflect atelectasis or an aspiration event.  Worsening infection cannot
 be excluded.  Small left pleural effusion is likely also present.  The heart
 is normal in size, normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement of right upper lung opacity with increased
 bibasilar opacities possibly reflecting atelectasis or aspiration though
 worsening infection cannot be fully excluded.
