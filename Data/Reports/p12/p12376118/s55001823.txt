                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD is stable in position. There are low lung volumes.  Prominence
 of the central pulmonary vasculature likely accentuated by low lung volumes
 and AP technique. Patchy right basilar opacity may be due to combination of
 vascular structures and low lung volumes but a consolidation is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Calcified ventricular aneurysm is again seen. Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. However,
 consolidation is not excluded at the right lung base.
