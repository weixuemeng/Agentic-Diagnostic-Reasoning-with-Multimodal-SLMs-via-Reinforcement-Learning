                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia  // ?pna, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are markedly low
 limiting assessment. An AICD is again seen with leads extending to the
 expected region of the right arm and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly appears
 grossly unchanged. A rounded calcified density projecting over the left chest
 wall likely represents a calcified breast implant. Subtle opacity at the right
 lung base appear slightly more conspicuous than on prior, may represent
 atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 context. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for perihilar opacities as
 these appear unchanged from prior. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Mediastinal contour is stable with calcified thoracic aorta. Imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the right lung base, more conspicuous than on prior,
 question atelectasis versus pneumonia.
