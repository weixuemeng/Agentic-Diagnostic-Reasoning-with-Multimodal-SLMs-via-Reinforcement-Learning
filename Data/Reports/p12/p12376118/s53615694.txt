                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY: Cough.  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis on ___ and chest radiograph
 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  Left-sided pacemaker ends in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Again seen is a calcified left
 ventricular aneurysm, not significantly unchanged.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Interstitial opacification suggests pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis and possibly small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest small bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary
 vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
