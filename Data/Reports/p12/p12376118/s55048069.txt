                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal views of the chest were obtained.  Widespread bilateral hazy opacities
 with indistinct costophrenic angles are consistent with severe pulmonary edema
 with small to moderate pleural effusions.  Ovoid calcification overlying the
 left heart border is consistent with a calcified left ventricular aneurysm. 
 Aortic knob calcification is present.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.1 cm
 above the carina.  Leads of a left-sided defibrillator projecting over the
 right atrium and ventricle.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.1 cm above the carina. 
 
 2.  Severe pulmonary edema with small to moderate sized pleural effusions.  
 
 3.  Ovoid calcification overlying the left heart border, compatible with
 calcified left ventricular aneurysm.
