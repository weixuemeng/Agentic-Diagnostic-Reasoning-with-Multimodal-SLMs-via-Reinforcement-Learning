                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, progressive weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right sided chest tube has been removed.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 demonstrated along with a moderate size right pleural effusion, slightly
 increased in size in the interval.  There is associated right basilar patchy
 opacity, likely compressive atelectasis.  A trace left pleural effusion is
 also likely present.  Calcified granulomas are noted bilaterally, as seen
 previously.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the right-sided chest tube with slight interval increase
 in size of a moderate right pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace left pleural effusion.
