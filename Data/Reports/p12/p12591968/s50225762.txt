                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer device.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 triple-lumen device extending to the region of the right atrium, apex of right
 ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  This raises
 the possibility of cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion.
