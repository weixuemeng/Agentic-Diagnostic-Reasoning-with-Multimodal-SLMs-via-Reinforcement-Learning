 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, ? Infiltrate  // ? Infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Prominence of the interstitial
 markings is again seen, likely related patient's known underlying nonspecific
 interstitial pneumonia, chronic.  The possibility of minimal superimposed
 interstitial edema is raised, although the findings are likely predominantly
 due to chronic process.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
