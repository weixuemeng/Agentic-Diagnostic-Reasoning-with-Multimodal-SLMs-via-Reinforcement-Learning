                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, sputum,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As on the
 prior study, there is continued pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight
 increased opacity at the lung bases may relate to fluid overload although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes
 are again seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly.  Slightly
 increased bibasilar opacities could relate to pulmonary vascular congestion,
 although underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
