                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of asthma, interstitial lung disease and known
 pneumonia on levofloxacin presents with  worsening oxygen saturation  //
 evaluate interval change for known pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Overall interstitial
 opacity is increased in the interval which raises concern for development of
 interstitial edema.  Difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia though
 findings appear diffuse.  No large effusion is seen.  The overall
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening interstitial opacities likely reflect development of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Difficult to exclude a subtle superimposed pneumonia.
