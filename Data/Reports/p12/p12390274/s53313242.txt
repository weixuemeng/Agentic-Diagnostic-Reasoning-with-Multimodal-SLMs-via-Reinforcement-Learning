                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  One week of nonproductive cough without fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size appears moderately
 enlarged, slightly increased when compared to the prior study.  The aorta
 remains tortuous and mildly calcified.  There is likely mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax visualized.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.
