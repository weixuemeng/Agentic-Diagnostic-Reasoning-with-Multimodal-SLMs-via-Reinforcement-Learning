                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increased seizure frequency.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Slight left base opacity is felt to most likely be due to
 atelectasis and overlying nipple shadow, however, findings can be better
 evaluated on dedicated PA and lateral views.  The right lung is clear.  No
 definite pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in opacity at the lateral left lung base may be
 due to atelectasis and overlying nipple shadow.  This could be further
 evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral views.
