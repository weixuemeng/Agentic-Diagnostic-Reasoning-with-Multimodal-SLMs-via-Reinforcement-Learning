                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recurrent left pleural effusions status post
 PleurX catheter. Left chest wall mass and left axillary disease secondary to
 high grade sarcoma/melanoma here with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest tube is demonstrated with tip projecting over the aortic knob, in
 similar position compared to the previous exam. Moderate size left pleural
 effusion is not substantially changed in the interval with continued left
 diaphragmatic elevation. Left basilar opacity likely reflects compressive
 atelectasis. Multiple nodular opacities are again seen within the right right
 lung compatible with metastases. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with contour bulge in the region of the AP window compatible with
 underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural
 effusion is demonstrated. Right basilar calcified pleural plaques are again
 noted. Numerous left-sided axillary clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous exam with unchanged left
 diaphragmatic elevation, moderate size left pleural effusion, and left basilar
 atelectasis. Similar appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules compatible with
 metastatic disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
