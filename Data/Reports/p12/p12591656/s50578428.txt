                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, recent pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to determine given the presence of a
 moderate left pleural effusion and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
 findings which are unchanged compared to the previous exam. Mediastinal
 contour is similar with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again demonstrated.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and the hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Left basilar atelectasis is re- demonstrated. A small right pleural effusion
 is also unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified. Known metastatic lesions
 within the chest are re- demonstrated but better visualized on the previous
 CT. Multiple clips are seen in the left axillary region and chest wall.
 Calcified pleural plaques are re- demonstrated bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis. Trace
 right pleural effusion, unchanged. Known pulmonary metastases grossly
 unchanged, but better assessed on previous CT.
