                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the right
 internal jugular line.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been marked increase in the left pleural
 effusion, large, which most likely is associated with atelectasis of the left
 lower lobe.  Right pleural effusion is noted, moderate.  Upper lungs are
 essentially clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.
