                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypothermia and tachycardia with concern for infectious source. 
 Also, bilateral pleural effusions.  Assess for infectious source and interval
 change in bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate bilateral
 pleural effusions, large on the left and moderate on the right.  Accounting
 for differences in positioning from the prior radiograph, these are relatively
 unchanged.  Otherwise, the lungs are essentially clear aside from bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac contour is obscured by a large left pleural
 effusion, but the mediastinal contour is normal.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of large left and moderate right pleural
 effusions with no acute pneumonia identified.
