                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fall.  Hilar mass seen at outside imaging.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a left retrocardiac opacity which
 obscures the left heart border and diaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal and the left mediastinal structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung opacity is thought to represent a
 post-obstructive infection in the setting of a known hilar mass.
