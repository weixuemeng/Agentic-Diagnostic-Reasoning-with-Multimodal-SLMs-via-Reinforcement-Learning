                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness  // infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Dual lead pacemaker projects over the
 left chest wall with leads extending into the region the right atrium and
 right ventricle. Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant. Subtle
 opacity is seen at the left lung base laterally which could represent
 pneumonia. Vague ground-glass opacity at the right lung apex is of unclear
 etiology. Areas of scarring in the right lung also seen with questionable
 nodularity in the right mid lung for which CT may be performed to further
 assess. The heart appears top normal in size. Mediastinal contour is normal.
 Old right upper rib cage deformity is noted. Right AC joint arthropathy noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity left lung base could represent pneumonia. Vague right apical
 ground-glass opacity and subtle right mid lung nodularity can be further
 assessed with CT or if prior CT exams exist, comparison is needed.
