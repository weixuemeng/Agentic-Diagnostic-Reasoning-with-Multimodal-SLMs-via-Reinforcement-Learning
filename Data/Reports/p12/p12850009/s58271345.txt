                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, hypoxia, question infiltrate, fluid.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  In addition, there is obscuration of the
 right hemidiaphragm consistent with collapse and/or consolidation, probably
 with some associated pleural fluid.  There is patchy opacity at the left base
 consistent with less pronounced left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 No gross left effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF -- this appearance may be accentuated
 by low inspiratory volumes.
 
 FINDINGS:  Findings concerning for right lower lobe pneumonia, new compared
 with ___ at 15:32 p.m.  Patchy opacity at left base.  Suspect mild CHF.
