                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Small volume thoracocentesis on the right.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after right
 thoracocentesis.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  The right pleural
 effusion has substantially decreased in extent, causing improved ventilation
 of the right lung base.  However, two areas of plate-like atelectasis
 persists.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung.
