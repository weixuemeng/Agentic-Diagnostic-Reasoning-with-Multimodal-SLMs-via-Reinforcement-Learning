                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple rib fractures.  Please reassess.
 
 COMPARISON:  Rib series from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Scattered opacities projecting over both lungs correspond to
 calcified pleural plaques, as seen on prior chest CT from ___. 
 Previously seen pulmonary edema on ___ has resolved.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 tortuous, as before.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 No displaced rib fractures are identified.  Known left-sided rib fractures
 were better identified on the prior CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Known left-sided rib fractures seen on CT from ___ are not
 well appreciated on today's study.
 
 2.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  Bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques, as before.
