                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  ___ x 19mm opacity projecting over
 the posterior heart on the lateral view could be a small lung nodule or
 fissural pleural fluid or thickening. There is no corresponding abnormality on
 the frontal view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and other
 pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is somewhat tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: Suggest repeat radiographs in two to four weeks to see if possible
 lower lobe nodule is still present.
