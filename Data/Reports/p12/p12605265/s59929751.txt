                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, presenting with persistent cough and shortness
 of breath.  Rales at the left base.  Assess for pneumonia or evidence of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperexpanded, without increased interstitial
 opacities to suggestive pulmonary edema.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are
 likely secondary to atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Tiny pleural effusions are not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
 
 2.  Possible tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
