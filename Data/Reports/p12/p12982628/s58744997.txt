                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, also cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with overlying
 atelectasis.  There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Extensive bilateral perihilar
 opacities have significantly decreased since the prior study.  There is marked
 cardiomegaly.  The aorta remains tortuous.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small, right greater than left bilateral pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement/mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Previously seen extensive pulmonary opacities have decreased in
 the interval.  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
