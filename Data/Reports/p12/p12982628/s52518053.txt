 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Right effusion, thoracocentesis 500 cc, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Pleural effusion has improved after thoracocentesis and is now minimal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Left small pleural effusion is unchanged.  Mild cardiac
 congestion is also stable in this patient with severe cardiac contour
 enlargement which is partially explained by known pericardial effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pneumothorax after right thoracocentesis.  Residual pleural
 effusion is minimal.
 2.  Stable severe cardiac contour enlargement is partly explained by
 pericardial effusion.
