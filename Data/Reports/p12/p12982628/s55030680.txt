                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a pleural effusion after thoracentesis, now
 with decreased breath sounds.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion or atelectasis to explain the change
 in physical findings.  Severe cardiomegaly and chronic pulmonary vascular
 congestion are longstanding.  I do not see pulmonary edema or pneumonia though
 some of the right lower lung is obscured by the right heart border with the
 patient rotated to her left.  As before thoracic aorta is heavily calcified
 and heavy dystrophic calcification is seen in aortic valve leaflets,
 presumably hemodynamically significant.
