                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with small bowel obstruction, admitting to surgery,
 nasogastric tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm with tip likely off the
 inferior borders of the film. Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged,
 accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal
 atelectasis is noted at lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen indicate prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube tip below the diaphragm, likely off the inferior borders of
 the film.  Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
