                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SBO  // please evaluate NGT placement     
 please evaluate NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, a nasogastric tube has been
 pushed forward to the mid to upper stomach. The side-port cannot be sharply
 seen and therefore it would be ideal.  If the nasogastric tube can be pushed
 forward to make certain that it is beyond esophagogastric junction.
