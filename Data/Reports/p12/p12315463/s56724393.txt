                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe mucositis in copious secretions.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema, aspiration, or interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright radiograph is performed with.
 
 COMPARISON:  Examination from 1 day previously.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, terminating at
 the cavoatrial junction.  A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is
 present, terminating in the lower SVC.
 
 The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes appear unchanged in within normal limits. 
 There is slightly increased opacity seen in the left base in the retrocardiac
 region, likely representing atelectasis, without a definite consolidative
 process.  Overall lung markings appear slightly increased when compared to the
 prior examination, although very similar in appearance is when compared to the
 examination from 2 days previous.  This is likely due to differences in
 penetration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, no appreciable interval change over the last few days. Left
 retrocardiac atelectasis appears slightly worse than the prior examination,
 but essentially unchanged when compared to the examination from ___
