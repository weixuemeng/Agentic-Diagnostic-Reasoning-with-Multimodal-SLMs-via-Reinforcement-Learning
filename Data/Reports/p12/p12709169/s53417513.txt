                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset light-headedness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  There is streaky opacities at the lung bases likely reflective
 of atelectasis.  Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis with possible trace right pleural effusion.
