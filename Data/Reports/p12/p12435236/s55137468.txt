                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest wall tumor status post resection,
 assess chest tubes for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiographs, the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Ill-defined opacity in the left upper-mid lung, demonstrating change in shape
 and size since yesterday, most likely represents a fluid collection in the
 chest wall, mostly related to recent chest tumor resection.  This appearance
 does not really characterize as pleural fluid.  Pleural effusion, if at all is
 small on the left side.  Right perihilar consolidation, increased since
 yesterday is probably aspiration, related to recent bronchoscopy (history
 obtained by Dr. ___ during discussion over the phone).  Right
 internal jugular sheath tip extends to the upper SVC.  There are at least
 three chest tubes on the left side with one ending in the left lung base while
 other two extending all the way to the left upper lung.  What appeared to be a
 mild to moderate effusion on yesterday's study is not appreciable today's.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Ill-defined opacity in the left upper-mid lung, changing its shape and size
 since yesterday is mostly chest wall collection, rather than pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Right perihilar consolidation has progressed, given status post
 bronchoscopy (as provided by Dr. ___ during discussion) this is
 mostly aspiration. 
 
  Dr. ___ discussed the findings with Dr. ___ by phone
 on ___ at approximately 9:20 a.m.
