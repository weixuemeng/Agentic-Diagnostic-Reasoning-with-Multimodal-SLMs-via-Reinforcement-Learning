                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view portable
 chest examination of ___ and PA and lateral chest examination of
 ___.  Frontal view demonstrates unchanged mediastinal structures
 including mild cardiac enlargement.  The left basal densities persist with a
 drainage catheter in place.  Small amount of local pleural density remains,
 but no evidence of major pneumothorax.  The amount of pleural density has not
 increased since the next preceding examination of ___.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No new abnormalities in the right hemithorax. 
 No significant mediastinal shift.  Again as identified on several previous
 examinations, there are demineralized vertebral bodies mostly in the lower
 portion of the thoracic spine with one marked compression of the lowermost
 vertebral body, probably T12 as seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small amount of pleural effusion in the presence of a
 drainage tube.  No major pneumothorax.  No new infiltrates.
