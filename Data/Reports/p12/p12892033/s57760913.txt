                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent pleural effusions, status post removal of catheter.  No
 baseline acquisition.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is approximately
 unchanged extent and appearance of bilateral pleural effusions.  A previously
 placed left pleural drain has been removed.  Both the left and right
 costophrenic sinuses are obscured by small amounts of effusion.  In addition,
 the lateral radiograph shows a small intrafissural effusion.
 
 Unchanged bilateral areas of atelectasis, left more than right, borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
