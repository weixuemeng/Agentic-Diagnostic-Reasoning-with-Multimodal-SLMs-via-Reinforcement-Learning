 at the left base.  There is also pleural fluid within the fissure on the left
 side.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  A small right pleural
 effusion is present.  Atelectasis is again present in the left lower lobe and
 retrocardiac region adjacent to the pleural effusion.  Again identified are
 compression deformities within the thoracic spine.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 mildly engorged compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. No
 pneumothorax is clearly seen.
