 On this single AP view, ill-defined, right perihilar opacity is present,
 either represent summation of soft tissue/vascular shadow or true parenchymal
 abnormality. Heart size is normal, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural abnormality.

 vascular/soft tissue structures or true parenchymal abnormality.  For further
