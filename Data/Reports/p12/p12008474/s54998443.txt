                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new central line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 20:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction
 of the SVC and right atrium.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Lung volumes are
 slightly reduced compared to the prior study with mildly increased atelectasis
 in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the SVC/right atrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax.  Increased atelectasis in the lung bases in the
 setting of decreased lung volumes.
