                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // Eval for cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, accentuating heart size, which is top-normal, and
 crowding the pulmonary vascular structures, which are mildly congested. A
 right PICC terminates in the right atrium, likely partially due to
 hypoinflation.  There is no large pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
  No evidence of pneumonia.
