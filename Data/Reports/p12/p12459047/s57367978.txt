                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PPM, tachycardia, NSTEMI
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low.  There is mild to moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Aorta appears tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities within the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.
