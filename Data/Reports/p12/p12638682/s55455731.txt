                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, coarse breath sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Right hilum
 remains prominent, compatible with enlargement of the pulmonary artery as seen
 on the prior CT scan.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bandlike
 right upper lobe opacity likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Additionally, bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There
 is no focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Streaky bibasilar and right upper lobe linear opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis. 
 
 2.  Right hilar enlargement likely reflective of pulmonary hypertension, as
 seen on the prior CT.
