 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through

 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes

 opacification at the left base, likely representing a combination of pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  The right lung is essentially clear. 
 There is an area of increased opacification in the left mid lung zone, an area
 of presumed lung biopsy.  There is a small left-sided apical pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left-sided apical pneumothorax.
