                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, CHF, assess for pulmonary edema or
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ and a CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable severe
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Defibrillator
 lead is positioned in the right ventricle.  On a background of emphysema and
 chronic lung changes, there are bibasilar reticular and linear opacifications,
 likely reflecting superimposed atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
 No overt pulmonary edema evident.  No pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe cardiomegaly.  Faint bibasilar opacifications on
 background emphysema and chronic lung disease likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 overt pulmonary edema.
