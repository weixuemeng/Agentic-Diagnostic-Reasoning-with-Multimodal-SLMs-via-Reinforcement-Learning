                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with h/o chf with hypoxia and tachypnea  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Fiducial marker and known left mid lung opacity laterally is better seen on
 prior CT scan and known pulmonary nodules are not clearly delineated on this
 portable exam. Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs are again
 noted but are likely chronic. Increased bibasilar opacities are likely
 atelectasis given the low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable. Left chest wall single lead pacing device is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Known pulmonary nodules are better
 seen on prior CT scan.
