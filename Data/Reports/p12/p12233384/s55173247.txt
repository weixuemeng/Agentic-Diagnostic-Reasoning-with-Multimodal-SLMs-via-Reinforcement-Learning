                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with restrictive lung disease and shortness of breath, to
 assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is mild elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure or a manifestation of the patient's known chronic
 lung disease.
 
 An area of increased opacification at the right base would be worrisome for
 developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Pacer lead again extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
