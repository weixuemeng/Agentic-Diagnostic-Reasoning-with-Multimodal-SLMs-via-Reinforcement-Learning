                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea with history of lung cancer.  Question
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen on
 the current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. 
 Retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis.  Left chest wall single-lead
 pacing device is again noted.  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Fiducial marker seen in the left mid
 lung laterally with mild associated opacity which is better seen on prior
 chest CT.  Known pulmonary nodules are better seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on low lung
 volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Known left lung opacity and pulmonary
 nodules are better seen on prior chest CT.
