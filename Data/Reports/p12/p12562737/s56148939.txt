                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M s/p fall with C-spine fracture, L1 fx, R orbital blowout,
 thrombosed R IJ, SAH, and facial lac.  // pneumonia?     pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some
 over hydration. And retrocardiac opacification with silhouetting of the medial
 aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen, consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, however, the
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
