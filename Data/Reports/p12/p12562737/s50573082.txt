  Low lung volumes are noted and accentuate the cardiac size. Right basilar
  opacity could reflect atelectasis though aspiration/pneumonia cannot be
  excluded. The right subclavian central line and left Port-A-Cath are in stable
  position.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is engorgement of
 pulmonary vessels suggesting some pulmonary vascular congestion. More focal
 opacification at the right base could represent atelectasis, though the
 possibility of superimposed aspiration or pneumonia would have to be
 considered. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with volume
