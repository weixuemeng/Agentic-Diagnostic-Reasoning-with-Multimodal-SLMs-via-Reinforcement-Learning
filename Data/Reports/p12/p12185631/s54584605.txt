                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent stroke, status post NG
 tube placement, confirm line position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Comparison of the images demonstrates that the
 patient previously tilted significantly backwards resulting in superposition
 of heavy breast shadows on the lung bases. The on previous examination
 expressed concern for possible infiltrates in the lung bases cannot be
 confirmed.  Heart size is unchanged and mild degree of cardiac enlargement is
 present.  Within the heart shadow, one can identify calcifications related to
 the mitral ring.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone
 redistribution pattern, but there is no evidence of advanced interstitial
 alveolar edema and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free.  An NG tube can be
 identified and is seen to reach well below the diaphragm including its side
 port.  The termination point of the line not included within the image field.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube reaches area of stomach.
