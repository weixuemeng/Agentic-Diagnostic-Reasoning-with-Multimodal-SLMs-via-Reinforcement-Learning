                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with acute onset confusion
 and memory loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal, and the aorta is
 tortuous.  There are multiple calcified lymph nodes in the left hilum, in the
 superior right mediastinum, and several others in the right lower and left
 lower lobes.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The visualized
 bony structures are markedly demineralized, and there are severe degenerative
 changes in the bilateral glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints.  No
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple calcified granulomas within the lungs and calcified lymph nodes
 in the hila and mediastinum may be seen with prior exposure to granulomatous
 disease such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.  Correlation with clinical
 history and/or acquisition of prior radiographs for comparison may be
 beneficial.
 2.  No acute cardiothoracic process.
