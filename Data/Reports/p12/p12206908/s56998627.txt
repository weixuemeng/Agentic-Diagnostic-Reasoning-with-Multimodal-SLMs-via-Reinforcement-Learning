                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Persistent hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 increase in interstitial markings bilaterally consistent with interstitial
 edema has improved since the prior study with minimal remaining.  Again patchy
 left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis, though
 an underlying consolidation may be present.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in interstitial edema with mild remaining. 
 Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is again seen, which could be due to
 atelectasis or consolidation.  Additionally, small patchy opacity projecting
 over posterior left sixth rib is new since the prior study and could represent
 a focus of infection.
