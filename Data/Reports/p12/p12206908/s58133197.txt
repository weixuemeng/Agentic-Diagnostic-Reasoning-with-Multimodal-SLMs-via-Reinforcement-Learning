                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is
 again evidence of prominence of interstitial markings consistent with some
 interstitial edema.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the more coalescent opacification at the left
 base with apparent silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm could represent a
 developing consolidation.
