                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever overnight and hypotension c/f
 infection. GNR in hip wound.  // C/f pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, a nonspecific opacity in the
 left retrocardiac region has worsened and could reflect atelectasis or
 developing infectious pneumonia.  This is difficult to assess on a  portable
 radiograph due to the presence of a known hiatal hernia contributing to this
 appearance.  Interstitial edema and small pleural effusions persist.
