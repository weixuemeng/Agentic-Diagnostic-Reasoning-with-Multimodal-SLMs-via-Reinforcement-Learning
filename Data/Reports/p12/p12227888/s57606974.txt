                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fall last week, right rib pain. Evaluate for fracture,
 contusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, as before, suggesting COPD. Blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic sulci secondary to a diaphragmatic flattening and unchanged. 
 There is no evidence for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema,
 pulmonary consolidation.  Heart size is mildly prominent. The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous. Hilar contours are stable with prominent central
 pulmonary arteries.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.
 The bones are demineralized. The ribs are not well assessed for fractures, as
 they are under penetrated for better evaluation of the lungs. No obvious rib
 fracture is seen. Mild dextroconvex thoracic curvature is again seen.
 Degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. COPD without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 2. The ribs are not well assessed.
