 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube has been advanced and now coils within the fundus. 
 Heart is mildly enlarged and the aorta is tortuous without change.  Persistent
 left superior mediastinal widening with rightward deviation of the trachea
 secondary to thyroid enlargement.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis persists, left
 greater than right.  A slightly more confluent area of opacity is seen in the
 left infrahilar region, and could reflect either atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
