                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CTA chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged with aortic core valve device
 in unchanged position. The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is of identified. Right
 anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation appears chronic, with numerous
 surgical anchors projecting over the left humeral head.  Old right-sided rib
 fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
