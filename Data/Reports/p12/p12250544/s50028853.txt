                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 bilaterally is unchanged, likely reflecting pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of underlying COPD.  Multiple soft
 tissue anchors are demonstrated within the left humeral head.  Degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Chronic enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally suggestive of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
