                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax with linear basilar
 atelectasis or scarring.  The heart is normal in size with calcified aortic
 contour. The aortic contour at the level of the distal aortic arch/proximal
 descending aorta demonstrates a minimally increased bulge which could reflect
 an intervally increased aneurysm.  Postsurgical changes are noted in the left
 shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: Potential slight increase in size of proximal descending
 aortic/aortic arch aneurysm. This can be further interrogated by CTA if
 indicated. 
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by
 phone.
