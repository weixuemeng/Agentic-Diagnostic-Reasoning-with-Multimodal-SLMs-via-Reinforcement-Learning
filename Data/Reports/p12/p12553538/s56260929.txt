                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:17.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mitral regurg and tachypnea, evaluate
 for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 23:44.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is retrocardiac opacity which on the prior surgery was felt to be
 related to a hiatal hernia.  On the current study, there is no air seen in
 this vicinity, so either this represents a hiatal hernia or could represent
 partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion. 
 Improved aeration in the right upper lobe consistent with resolved
 atelectasis.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema, although the pulmonary vasculature is crowded.  Bilateral old healed
 rib fractures as well as a healed left humeral fracture are again seen.
