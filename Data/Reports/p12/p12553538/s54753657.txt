 INDICATION:   ___F with hypoxia  // hypoxic, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes are noted.  Retrocardiac opacity is seen which was
 better characterized on prior abdominal CT scan as a large hiatal hernia. 
 Patient is significantly rotated to the left, within this limitation the lungs
 are otherwise grossly clear without new confluent consolidation. There is
 however pulmonary vascular congestion. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted in the thoracic aorta. Mitral annular calcifications are also
 identified. No significant change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 identified given patient's rotation.  Right-sided PICC is seen however tip is
 not clearly delineated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion, no definite other acute process.
