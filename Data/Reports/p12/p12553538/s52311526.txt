                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new onset of pancytopenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest x-ray from earlier the same day at
 7:53 a.m. from the ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are again
 noted.  Dense retrocardiac opacity is likely due in part to known hiatal
 hernia present on prior CT abdomen from ___.  There is also a
 small right-sided pleural effusion.  Engorged pulmonary vasculature is
 compatible with vascular congestion.  Posterior and posterolateral right rib
 fractures affecting ribs 7 and 8 appear old.  Additional right lateral rib
 fractures are not well characterized.  Deformity of the proximal left humerus
 is compatible with prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion and small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Dense retrocardiac opacity is compatible with large hiatal hernia
 seen on prior exam.
