                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough x 2 days, with sputum, no fever.
 Exam shows wheeziness in both lungs. No prior h/o asthma or COPD. Nonsmoker.
 No JVD or leg swelling.  // r/o pneumonia or pulm edema    r/o pneumonia or
 pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Radiographic appearance of the chest has not changed since ___,
 including poor definition of the posterior diaphragmatic surface on the
 lateral view and greater radiodensity projecting over the lower thoracic
 spine.  Since these are chronic findings, I do not attribute them to
 pneumonia.  Sclerotic degenerative changes in the vertebral endplates are
 contributory and the descending thoracic aorta projects over them.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  Cardiomegaly is moderate and there is no evidence of
 cardiac decompensation.
