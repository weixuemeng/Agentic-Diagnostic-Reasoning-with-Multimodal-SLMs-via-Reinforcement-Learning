                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent NG tube placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates an enteric
 catheter terminating within the body of the stomach.  The sideport is just
 beyond the GE junction and could be advanced several centimeters.  Accounting
 for differences in position, bilateral pleural effusions are slightly
 decreased compared to prior examination.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enteric catheter tip in stomach, though could be advanced several
 centimeters to place the sideport beyond GE junction.
