                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF but receiving fluids for IV contrast
 load  // lung fluid status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right central venous catheter ends in the upper superior vena cava. Two
 upper enteric tubes end off of the radiograph. Compared to the prior
 radiograph, performed 1 day prior, new increased density in the right lung
 likely represents increase in a moderate right pleural effusion. A small left
 pleural effusion has also increased in size.  Early interstitial edema is
 present in the left lung. The lung volumes are low. Bilateral lower lobe
 opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in a moderate right and small left pleural effusions and new
 early interstitial edema in the left lung since 1 day prior. Left lower lobe
 atelectasis persists.
