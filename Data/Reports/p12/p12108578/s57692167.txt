                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with NASH cirrhosis with SOB.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is a large right pleural
 effusion with associated right mid and lower lung atelectasis.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular markings at the right hilum likely account for right
 suprahilar opacity though difficult to exclude an underlying mass.  Followup
 to resolution advised.  Left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.  No bony
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with significant atelectasis of the right middle
 lower lobes.  Difficult to exclude an underlying acute process.  Abnormal
 appearance of the right pulmonary hilum likely due to crowding of
 bronchovascular markings.  Followup to resolution advised.
