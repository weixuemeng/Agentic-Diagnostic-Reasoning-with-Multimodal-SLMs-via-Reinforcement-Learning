                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cirrhosis, diminished breath sounds  in the right lung 
 base.  Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size cannot be definitively assessed due to adjacent pleural effusion,
 but is likely unchanged.
 
 Compared to ___, no significant change in moderate right pleural
 effusion.  There is adjacent right compressive atelectasis.
 
 No left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate in size pleural effusion which appears similar to the prior with
 probable compressive right lower and middle lobe atelectasis.  Difficult to
 exclude an underlying malignant process and follow-up to resolution is
 advised.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Recommend follow-up to resolution.
