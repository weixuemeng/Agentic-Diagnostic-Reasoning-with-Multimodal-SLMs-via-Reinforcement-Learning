                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Left greater
 than right bibasilar opacities may relate to pleural effusions and overlying
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidations are not excluded.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right PICC
 has been placed in the interval, terminating in the proximal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent combination of effusions and atelectasis,
 although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
