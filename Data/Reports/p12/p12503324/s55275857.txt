                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right pleural effusion has
 decreased in size.  Small areas of lucency at the right base and along the
 right heart border could reflect some small amount of pneumothorax. 
 Substantial left effusion persists, as do bibasilar opacities, most likely
 reflects atelectasis.
