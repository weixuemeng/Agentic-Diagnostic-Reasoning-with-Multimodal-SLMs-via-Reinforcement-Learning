 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:32 PM
  Right lower lobe heterogeneous opacities have substantially decreased compared
  to radiographs from ___, although increased lung volumes may cause
  an overestimate of the degree of improvement.   Left retrocardiac
  consolidative opacification is not significantly changed.  No pneumothorax.
  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  Right PICC ends in the mid to
  upper SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The right basilar opacification has substantially
 decreased.  Area of increased opacification persists at the left base.
 
 The residual opacifications could well reflect some atelectasis, though some
 residual consolidation would have to be considered.
 
 Surgical fusion device in the lower cervical spine is again seen as well as a
 right central catheter, which extends to the upper-to-mid portion of the SVC.
 
 On the lateral view, there is opacification in the costophrenic angle and
 major fissure, consistent with pleural effusion probably on the right.
