 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncopal episode.  Question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exams

 opacities, left greater than right.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Anterior and posterior lower
 cervical and upper thoracic spinal hardware is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  Mild upper-to-mid thoracic compression deformity is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, noting that
 aspiration or infection particularly on the left cannot be excluded.
