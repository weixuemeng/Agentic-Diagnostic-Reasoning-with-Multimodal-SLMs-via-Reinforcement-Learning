                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right hand swelling.  Evaluate PICC line.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC is in unchanged position with the tip in the mid SVC. 
 The lung volumes are low.  Again, there are moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions which appear marginally increased in size.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 appears stable.  There is new interstitial prominence, suggestive of mild
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of right PICC in the mid SVC.
 2.  Slight increase in the bilateral pleural effusions; stable associated
 atelectasis.
 3.  New mild pulmonary edema.
