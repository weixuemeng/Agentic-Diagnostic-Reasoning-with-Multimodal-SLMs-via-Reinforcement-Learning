 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  MDS,shortness of breath status post diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before.
 
 Bilateral large pleural effusions larger on the right side have minimally
 decreased allowing for the difference in positioning of the patient.  It is
 associated with adjacent atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cervical spine hardware is again noted.  Calcified
 granuloma is noted in the right upper lobe.
