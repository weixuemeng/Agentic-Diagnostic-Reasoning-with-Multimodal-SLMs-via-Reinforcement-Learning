                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, question for volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including most recent chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again identified
 and appear similar to that seen on ___.  Additionally, there is now
 increased opacity in the left mid to lower lung, which is suggestive of
 pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette appears unchanged and at upper limits of
 normal.  Degenerative changes are noted at bilateral glenohumeral joint and
 acromioclavicular joint on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions appear relatively
 stable.  New increased opacity is now noted in the left mid to lower lung and
 suggestive of pneumonia.
