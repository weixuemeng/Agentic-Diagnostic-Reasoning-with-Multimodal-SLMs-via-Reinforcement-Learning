  Subtle opacity projecting over the lateral right mid lung may be due to
  overlap of structures, but underlying pulmonary opacity or even rib fracture
  is not excluded. Findings could be further assessed with shallow oblique
  radiographs or chest CT.
  
  No displaced rib fracture definitively identified. However, if clinical
  concern persists, dedicated rib series or chest CT is more sensitive.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p MVC with R 4th rib tenderness, mid axillary line
 *** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same last name!  // Eval for rib
 fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle opacity is seen projecting over the lateral right mid lung which may be
 due to overlap of structures, but underlying pulmonary opacity is not
 excluded.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Minimal left base atelectasis is seen.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced rib fracture is definitively
 identified. However, if clinical concern persists, dedicated rib series or
 chest CT is more sensitive.
