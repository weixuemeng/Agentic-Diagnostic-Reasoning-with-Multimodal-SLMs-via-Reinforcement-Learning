                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with prostate cancer and
 shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 The patient is after extensive hardware placement in the thoracic spine as
 well as sclerotic vertebral bodies seen.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.  Nodular opacities projecting over the right mid lung,
 potentially represent a patient nipple, thus assessment with nipple markers
 and shallow oblique views is recommended.  Lungs are hyperinflated but
 otherwise clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
