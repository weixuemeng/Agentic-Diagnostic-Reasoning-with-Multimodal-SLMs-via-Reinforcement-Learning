                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, as
 well as indistinct appearance of pulmonary vessels.  Fissures are mildly
 thickened.  Patchy basilar opacities are not specific and may be due to
 atelectasis, but the possibility of developing pneumonia, especially in the
 posterior left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region, could be considered. 
 The bones appear demineralized.  Degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities
 in the right cardiophrenic sulcus and posterior left lower lobe; although
 these could be seen with atelectasis, developing pneumonia is a consideration.
