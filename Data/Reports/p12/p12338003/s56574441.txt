                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p esophagectomy, readmit w RLL PNA; intubated and placed
 OGT  // eval OGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiograph obtained for orogastric tube placement demonstrates an orogastric
 tube extending at least to the level of the diaphragm.  Upper abdomen was not
 included on the radiograph and distal tip cannot be visualized for this
 reason.  As compared to recent study from earlier the same date, exam is
 remarkable for overall worsening of multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities
 with no other relevant changes.
