                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p esophagectomy, recurrent aspiration PNA,
 s/p extubation  // eval ? interval improvement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP semi upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A pigtail pleural catheter projects over the left lower chest, as before. 
 Left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  The nasogastric
 tube is barely visible, but the tip appears to project over the
 gastroesophageal junction similar to the prior examination.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Extensive heterogeneous bilateral
 airspace opacities have not significantly changed compared to prior
 examination.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Minimal change in the appearance of widespread heterogeneous bilateral
 opacities.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube tip remains at the gastro esophageal junction and should
 be advanced.
