                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___/M s/p ___ esophagectomy, with concern for ongoing
 aspiration, here w respiratory distress/a.fib  // Interval assesment    
 Interval assesment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, emphysema and
 pulmonary fibrosis has been present radiographically for some time.  However
 there has been worsening of pulmonary edema over the past 12 hr.  I do not
 believe that the contour in the right upper hemi thorax is a pneumothorax.  It
 is probably a skin fold.
 
 Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Left jugular line
 ends in the low SVC.
