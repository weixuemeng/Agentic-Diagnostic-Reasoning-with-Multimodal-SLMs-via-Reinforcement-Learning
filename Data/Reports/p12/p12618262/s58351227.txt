                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unresponsive due to toxic ingestion, query evidence of
 aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded. A double
 contour of the breast tissue bilaterally is consistent with bilateral breast
 implants. Hazy opacification of the lower lungs may be accounted for by breast
 implants.  However, the suggestion of air bronchograms in the left
 retrocardiac space with slightly increased density in this area may be
 indicative of an acute process. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible left retrocardiac opacity, which may be accounted for by
 breast implant.  Lateral radiograph is recommended for further evaluation.
