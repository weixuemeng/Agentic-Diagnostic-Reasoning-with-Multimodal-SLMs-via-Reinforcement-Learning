                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low.  Endotracheal tube is in standard position
 terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube tip and side
 port are within the stomach.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter
 tip lies within the right atrium similar to that seen the previous study. 
 Heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, appearing mildly enlarged. 
 Similarly, the superior mediastinum appears widened due to supine AP
 positioning and low lung volumes.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 present with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis, however aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Markedly low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Aspiration
 at the lung bases cannot be completely excluded.
 2. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
