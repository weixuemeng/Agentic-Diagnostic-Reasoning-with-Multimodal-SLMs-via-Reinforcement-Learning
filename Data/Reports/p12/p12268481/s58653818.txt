  Lung volumes are low, which results in crowding of the bronchovascular
  structures.  Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis but could reflect
  pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and sepsis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes, which result in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Bibasilar
 opacifications most likely represent atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, developing pneumonia would have to be considered.
