                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chills in a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis and
 shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Lung volumes are low with minimal bibasilar areas of atelectasis, mostly seen
 in the right lower lobe but no definitive evidence of pneumonia.  Upper lungs
 are clear.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Minimal amount of
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded, but there is no substantial amount of
 pleural fluid seen.
 
 Lateral view demonstrates also right middle lobe opacity also most likely
 reflecting atelectasis, but again infectious process coexisting with
 atelectasis cannot be excluded.
