 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, respiratory symptoms, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing opacity at
 the right lung base has completely resolved.  The current radiograph shows
 absence of parenchymal opacities and absence of other acute changes such as
 pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette remains borderline, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 other relevant changes.
