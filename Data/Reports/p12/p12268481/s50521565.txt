                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a new right middle lobe and
 left lower lobe consolidation with associated left pleural effusion.  In
 addition, there is a mildly enlarged heart with mildly increased vascular
 congestion and enlargement of the azygous vein suggestive of increased patient
 fluid volume.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New bibasilar opacities, some of which may represent atelectatic changes, but
 in view of the patient clinical history, likely represents pneumonia. 
 
 These findings were discussed with the medical house officer caring for the
 patient.
