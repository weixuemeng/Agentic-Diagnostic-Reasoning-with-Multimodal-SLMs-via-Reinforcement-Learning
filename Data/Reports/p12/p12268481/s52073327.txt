  An endotracheal tube ends in the lower thoracic trachea.  Lung volumes are low
  and a right perihilar opacity is unchanged.  The heart size is within normal
  limits.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right IJ line ends in the right atrium
  or IVC.  Tubing projecting over the midline likely represents an enteric tube
  which courses below the level of the diaphragm and coils in the stomach.

 below the carina.  Care should be taken that it not advanced any further. 
 Lung volumes are very low, reflected in moderate to severe bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Upper lungs are grossly clear.  Heart is probably enlarged but
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Right jugular line ends close to the
 inferior cavoatrial junction.  Pleural effusion if any is not appreciable.  No
