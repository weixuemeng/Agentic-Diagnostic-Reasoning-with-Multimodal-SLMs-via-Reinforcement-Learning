                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Snoring respiration, altered mental status, question
 pneumonia or obstruction.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest provided.  The endotracheal
 tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 1.3 cm above the carina. 
 Retraction by at least 1-2 cm would result in more optimal placement.  The NG
 tube descends into the left upper quadrant.  There is scattered subsegmental
 atelectasis, most confluent in the left lower lobe.  The possibility of
 aspiration or pneumonia difficult to exclude in the left lower lobe.  There is
 likely a small left effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Scattered areas of atelectasis with left lower lobe
 consolidation, question atelectasis versus aspiration/pneumonia.
