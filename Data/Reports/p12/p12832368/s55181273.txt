                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // dyspnea, hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 Probable background hyperinflation.  There is mild cardiomegaly, similar to
 the prior study.  As before, there is slight prominence of the right left
 pulmonary arteries, which could reflect an element of pulmonary hypertension. 
 The aorta is calcified.
 
 On today's exam, there is upper zone redistribution and mild increased
 interstitial markings.  More  confluent opacities are seen in the right upper
 zone, right and left lung bases.  There is increased retrocardiac density,
 consistent with collapse and/or consolidation, similar to ___ , but
 slightly more pronounced.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is
 compatible with small effusions.  Possible mild bronchiectasis at the left
 lung base and in the right suprahilar region.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly, with prominence of the right and left hila, unchanged.
 2. Upper zone redistribution.
 3. Mild increase in interstitial markings, with more focal patchy opacities in
 right upper zone and both bases.  This could represent early alveolar edema. 
 Other causes of multifocal alveolar opacities, such as multifocal pneumonic
 infiltrates or, less likely hemorrhage, are in the differential.
 4. Probable small pleural effusions.
 5. Increased retrocardiac opacity, slightly more pronounced than on the prior
 study, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 6. Possible bronchiectasis at the left base and right suprahilar region.
