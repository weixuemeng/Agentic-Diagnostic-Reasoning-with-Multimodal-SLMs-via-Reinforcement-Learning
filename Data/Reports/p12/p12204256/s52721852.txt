                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pulmonary nodule status post superior segment right
 lower lobe wedge.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:21.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a right-sided drain/chest tube with right chest wall
 subcutaneous emphysema seen, likely post-procedural.  Minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace right pleural effusion.  There
 is mild lingular and left lower lobe atelectasis which has improved in the
 interval.  Mild right base atelectasis is seen.  There is persistent mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
