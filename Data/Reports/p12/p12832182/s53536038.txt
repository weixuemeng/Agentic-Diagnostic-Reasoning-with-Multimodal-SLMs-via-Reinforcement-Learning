                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient presents with exhaustion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is scarring in the left suprahilar region
 with upward retraction and a suture line suggesting prior partial lung
 resection.  The lung architecture is also coarse and heterogeneous,
 particularly in the upper lungs on the left, which may suggest scarring or
 potentially emphysema in the upper lungs.  Streaky opacity again partly
 obscures the right costophrenic sulcus; slight upward tenting of the left
 hemidiaphragm is also unchanged and suggests slight scarring.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Mild degenerative changes along the thoracic spine are
 similar.  No free air is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting underlying emphysema.  Similar post-operative
 changes in the left upper hemithorax.  No evidence of acute disease.
