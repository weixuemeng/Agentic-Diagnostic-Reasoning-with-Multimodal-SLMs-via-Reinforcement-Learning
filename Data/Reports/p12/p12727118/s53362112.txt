                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of severe right upper
 quadrant and right lower quadrant pain, history of hepatitis C, question air
 under the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm. 
 Retrocardiac opacity just to the left of midline on the frontal view may
 relate to a hiatal hernia, which could be confirmed on pending abdomen/pelvis
 CT.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Upper paratracheal opacity may relate to prominent vascular
 structures; there is no deviation of the adjacent trachea.
