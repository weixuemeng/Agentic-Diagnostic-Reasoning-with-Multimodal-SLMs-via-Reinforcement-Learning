                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoglycemia at rehab today, briefly
 unresponsive, now hypoxic with coarse breath sounds, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Evaluation is
 limited given low lung volumes.  Overlying EKG leads are also present which
 slightly limit the evaluation.  There are ground-glass poorly defined
 opacities involving the lower lungs bilaterally, slightly more prominent on
 the left than right.  This appearance may be related to pneumonia or possibly
 aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 size appears top normal.  Aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. 
 The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral mid to lower lung opacities left greater than right,
 could reflect pneumonia or aspiration.
