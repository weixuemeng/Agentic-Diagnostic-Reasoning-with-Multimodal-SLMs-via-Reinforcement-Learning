 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe collapse has resolved. Small nodular shadows at the lung bases
 laterally are probably nipple shadows. I would recommend shallow oblique views
 with nipple markers to confirm this. Lungs are otherwise clear.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Tiny left pleural effusion
 may be present, but I doubt that this is of any clinical significance.
