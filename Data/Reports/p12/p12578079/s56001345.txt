                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bronchopneumonia and persistent O2
 requirement  // effusion? interval change in PNA?      effusion? interval
 change in PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___  the left hilus or radiodensity projecting over the hilus has
 increased substantially, the adjacent border of the adjacent upper left heart
 border has become obscured, left hemidiaphragm has become elevated, and the
 upper trachea has migrated slightly to the left.  These findings suggest new
 left upper lobe or lingular collapse, and there may be bronchial obstruction
 to thank.  I have spoken with the referring physician to request conventional
 radiographs, particularly lateral and oblique views for confirmation. Chest CT
 scanning may be necessary.
 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
 Heart size is normal.
