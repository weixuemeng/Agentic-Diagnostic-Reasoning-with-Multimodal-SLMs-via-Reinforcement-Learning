 HISTORY:  COPD with hypoxia after ERCP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are somewhat lower lung
 volumes.  Some coarse interstitial markings are seen at the bases and there is
 again flattening of the hemidiaphragms, all consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  No definite acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
