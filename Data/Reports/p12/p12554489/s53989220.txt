                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right perihilar opacity
 worrisome for pneumonia.  Heart size is enlarged with vascular engorgement and
 small bilateral pleural effusions, accompanied by mild pulmonary edema.  A
 retrocardiac density may reflect asymmetric edema or alternatively infectious
 process. There is no pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.  More confluent basilar
 opacification could reflect asymmetrical edema or secondary process such as
 infectious pneumonia or aspiration.
