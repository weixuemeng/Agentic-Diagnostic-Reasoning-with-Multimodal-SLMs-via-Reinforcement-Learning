                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lumpectomy with left axillary chest wall pain for one day.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are surgical clips
 projected over the upper portion of the left breast, presumably from recent
 lumpectomy.  Clips are also seen in the axillary region.  An opaque tubular
 structure is seen paralleling the lateral chest wall on this side.
 
 No evidence of abnormality involving the underlying lung.
