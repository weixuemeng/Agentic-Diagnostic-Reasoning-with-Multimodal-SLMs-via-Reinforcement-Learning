 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Generalized opacification has improved somewhat suggesting reduction in fluid
 overload, but on this examination there is a developing opacity projecting
 over the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe.  There is still a
 substantial nodular focus projecting over the left mid lung and possibly a
 second one projecting nearby.  The right mid-to-lower lung is difficult to
 assess for any possible nodules. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reduction in generalized opacification suggesting fluid overload,
 but developing right lower lung opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Persistent
 nodular focus projecting over the left mid lung and possibly a second one; if
 these were confirmed to represent true pulmonary nodules rather than summation
 artifact and/or a nipple shadow, then these might potentially represent new
 metastatic disease.
