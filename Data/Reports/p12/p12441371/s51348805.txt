 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia and aspiration // NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is a stable left-sided
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Increased opacification of the
 right base is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line ends in the mid
 SVC. The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach with the last side port at the
 GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach with the last side port at the GE
 junction, and should be advanced further prior to use.
