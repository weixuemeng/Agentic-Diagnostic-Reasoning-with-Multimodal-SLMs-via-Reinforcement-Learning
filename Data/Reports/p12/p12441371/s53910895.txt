                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from chest CT performed on ___ and
 likewise from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A new interstitial
 abnormality is suggestive of pulmonary edema.  Opacities include a possible
 nodule projecting over the left mid lung, measuring about 15 mm in diameter; a
 nipple shadow could also be considered.  There is also at least one posterior
 right basilar nodule measuring about 12 mm in diameter that was probably
 already present before with patchy surrounding opacification that has not
 resolved.  Fissures are mildly thickened.  The lateral views suggest trace
 pleural effusions.  The bones appear demineralized.  Vertebral body heights
 and interspaces appear maintained.  There is mild rightward curvature centered
 along the lower thoracic spine that is probably for the most part positional. 
 Bone destruction involves the left distal clavicle, as seen previously, but
 somewhat difficult to compare to the prior scout view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema; differential considerations
 include atypical infection however.   
 
 2.  Possible substantial new nodule projecting over the left mid lung versus
 nipple shadow.  
 
 3.  Right posterior basilar opacities with at least one discrete nodule,
 difficult to compare to the prior study, but with no clear suggestion of
 substantial change.
