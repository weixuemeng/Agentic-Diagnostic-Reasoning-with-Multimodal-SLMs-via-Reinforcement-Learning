                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal PNA and acute aspiration event 
 // evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Right basilar opacification has
 increased in density on this study, concerning for worsening pneumonia or
 aspiration. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line ends in the
 distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the right base likely represents pneumonia, however
 aspiration is also possible.
