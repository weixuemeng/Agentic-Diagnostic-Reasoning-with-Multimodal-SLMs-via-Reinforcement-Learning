                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and the aorta is diffusely
 tortuous.  Lungs are clear except for a small linear focus of atelectasis or
 scarring in the left lower lobe.  There are no pleural effusions.  Bones are
 diffusely demineralized.  Associated mild compression deformities in the spine
 are of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary abnormality.
 2.  Apparent osseous demineralization and mild compression deformities in
 several thoracic vertebral bodies.  Does the patient have a history of steroid
 use or other risk factors for bone demineralization?
