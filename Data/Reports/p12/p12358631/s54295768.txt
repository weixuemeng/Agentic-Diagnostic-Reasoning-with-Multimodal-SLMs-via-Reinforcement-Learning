                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Prior pneumonia and feeling poorly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears in a similar position.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in
 technique.  The lung volumes are very low.  Particularly in that setting,
 minimal left basilar opacities are probably associated with minor atelectasis.
 The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting minor left basilar atelectasis without
 definite evidence for pneumonia.
