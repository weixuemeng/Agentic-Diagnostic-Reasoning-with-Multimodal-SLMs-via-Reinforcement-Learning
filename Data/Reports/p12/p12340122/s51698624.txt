                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of COPD, coming in with wheezing, DOE.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, lung volumes are lower causing bronchovascular
 crowding and accentuation of the heart size.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Areas of perifissural thickening and atelectasis
 are similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal consolidation.  Lung volumes are lower causing a component of
 bronchovascular crowding.
