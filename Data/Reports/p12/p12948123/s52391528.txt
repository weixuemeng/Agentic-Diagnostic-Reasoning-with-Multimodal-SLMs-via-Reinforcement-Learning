                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea. Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval removal of the right internal
 jugular central venous line. Cardiomediastinal contour has also improved,
 although remains moderately enlarged. Lung volumes are slightly reduced and
 retrocardiac opacification may represent atelectasis, however infection is not
 excluded. Small left pleural effusion is likely.
 Peribronchial cuffing is noted in the right hilar region, which is the only
 residual sign of fluid overload from the prior study from late ___, as the
 interstitial edema has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in cardiac size and interstitial edema since ___.
 2.  Slight decrease in lung volumes and increase in retrocardiac opacity,
 which likely represents atelectasis, however infection is not excluded.
