                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypertension and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable single AP chest radiograph was obtained. Although suboptimal
 technique, the heart appears enlarged obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm
 may reflect atelectasis though a focal infectious consolidation cannot be
 excluded. Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles is consistent with
 bilateral pleural effusions. Vascular congestion is noted as well as
 cephalization of vessels. Hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise
 unremarkable. Osseous structures demonstrates no acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema
