                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is mild
 right basilar atelectasis without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are normal.  A right port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, likely due to hepatic metastases seen on subsequent
 CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
