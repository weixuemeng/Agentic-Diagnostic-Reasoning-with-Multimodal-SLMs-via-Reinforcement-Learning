 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with endotracheal tube placement, check
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 8:53.
 
 Single portable supine chest film ___ at 15:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5-4 cm above the carina.  There has been
 interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is coiled within the stomach. 
 Patchy airspace disease at the right lung base is concerning for aspiration
 and/or pneumonia.  There also appears to be patchy retrocardiac airspace
 disease.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits, although the left ventricle is prominent suggesting left ventricular
 hypertrophy.  No acute bony abnormality.
