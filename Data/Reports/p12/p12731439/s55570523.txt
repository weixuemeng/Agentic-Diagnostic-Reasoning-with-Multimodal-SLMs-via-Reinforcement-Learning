                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  Lung
 volumes are persistently low.  Coarse interstitial opacities are seen
 diffusely along with bronchiectasis, compatible with a chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  No pulmonary edema, new focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected. 
 Degenerative changes are noted involving both glenohumeral joints as well as
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from prior study.  Low lung volumes with re-
 demonstration of chronic interstitial lung disease.
