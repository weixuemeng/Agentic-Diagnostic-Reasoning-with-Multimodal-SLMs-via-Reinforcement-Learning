                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 COMPARISON EXAMS:  AP portable chest ___, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new small consolidation at the right lung base.
 Otherwise the lungs are clear.   There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 There is enlargement of the right mediastinum.  The heart remains moderately
 enlarged, and the aorta remains large and tortuous.  There is abnormal contour
 of the left upper mediastinum which suggests an aberrant right subclavian
 artery, which has been present on prior studies.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lung base early pneumonia or atelectasis. Early pneumonia is the
 preferred diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting.  
 2.  Engorgement of the mediastinal vessels consistent with increased central
 venous pressure.
 3.  Stable chronic cardiomegaly and enlarged aorta.
