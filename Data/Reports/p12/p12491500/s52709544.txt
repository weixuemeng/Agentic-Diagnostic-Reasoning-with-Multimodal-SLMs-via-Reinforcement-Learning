                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The right cardiac
 silhouette is well defined and appears enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right cardiac border is well defined and appears enlarged, which
 may reflect right atrial enlargement or a pericardial cyst formation.  Further
 assessment with cardiac echo can be considered, as clinically indicated.
