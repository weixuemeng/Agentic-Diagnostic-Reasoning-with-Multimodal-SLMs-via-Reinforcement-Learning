                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ESLD, assess for interval changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:11 a.m.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 5 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the
 superior vena cava.  
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacity likely reflects a combination of layering
 effusions and compressive atelectasis and is essentially unchanged in
 appearance.  Perihilar vessels appear cephalized raising the possibility of
 pulmonary venous hypertension.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
