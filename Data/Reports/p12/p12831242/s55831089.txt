                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post open AAA repair, now with leukocytosis.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube.  Two
 endogastric tubes course into the stomach; one of which side port is well
 below the GE junction; the other of which tip sits in the gastric antrum or
 early duodenum.  The left-sided PICC tip sits in the mid SVC.  The right-sided
 central line tip sits in the lower SVC.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unremarkable.  The lungs show no lobar consolidation.  Additionally,
 indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm suggests small amount of pleural
 fluid and atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis.
