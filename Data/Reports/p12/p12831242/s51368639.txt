                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  New Dobbhoff feeding tube, evaluate position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:37.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 15:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid superior vena
 cava.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube now has its tip beneath the diaphragm likely
 positioned within the stomach.  Part of the feeding tube appears to be coiled
 over the upper thorax/neck but this may be extrinsic to the patient.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
 
 2.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacity with likely layering effusions,
 right greater than left, suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although
 bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
