                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An opacity overlying the right lower lobe could be pneumonia or rib
 sclerosis, best differentiated by oblique projections.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A small left pleural effusion
 may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Known T12 vertebral body
 compression fracture is not fully evaluated on this study. The ribs appear
 sclerotic and consistent with patient's history of prostate cancer. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Oblique radiographs recommended to distinguish possible right
 lower lobe pneumonia from sclerotic rib metastases.
