                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, chronic pain, assess for pneumonia as cause
 for hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Large body
 habitus and underpenetrated technique limits evaluation.  Allowing for this,
 there is no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the
 aortic knob.  Heart size is likely within normal limits.  The imaged osseous
 structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
