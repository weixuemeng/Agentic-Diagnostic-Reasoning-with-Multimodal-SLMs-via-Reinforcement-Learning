                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pacemaker placement.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged.  The pacemaker leads inserted
 through the left subclavian approach terminates in the expected location of
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs are essentially clear.  The aortic
 arch contour appears to be slightly different from the prior study with a new
 superimposed opacity, not seen on prior two x-rays, most likely due to
 different rotation of the patient.  Non-urgent assessment with chest CT is
 recommended for precise characterization of the finding.
