                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an oblong approximately 5.5 cm radiopaque device overlying the left
 heart, of uncertain significance, possibly extracorporeal.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  Mild aortic
 arch calcifications are noted.  Aside from calcified left hilar lymph nodes,
 the hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting of
 the bilateral lateral CP angles may represent trace pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Equivocal trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  Unchanged calcified left hilar lymph nodes.
 2. oblong approximately 5.5 cm radiopaque device overlying the left heart, of
 uncertain significance, likely extracorporeal.  Correlate with physical exam.
