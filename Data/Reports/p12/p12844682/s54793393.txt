                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o Afib on coumad, s/p fall transferred from OSH for eval of
 R frontal lobe contusion and R periprosthetic femur fracture  // interval
 assesment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 7.2 cm above
 the carina, unchanged compared to the prior study.  This could be advanced for
 more secure seating.  There are unchanged bibasilar opacities, most prominent
 along the right heart border.  Again, this likely reflects aspiration or
 atelectasis in the setting of intubation.  No pneumothorax seen. No rib
 fracture seen.  A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized on
 this study but appears to be below the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change compared to the prior study.  The endotracheal
 tube remains relatively high in position, 7.2 cm proximal to the carina.
