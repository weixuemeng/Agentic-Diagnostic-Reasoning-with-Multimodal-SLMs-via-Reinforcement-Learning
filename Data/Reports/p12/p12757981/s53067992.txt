                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior hospitalization for Legionella pneumonia, to assess for
 resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images are available.  There is an increased
 opacification at the left base, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 pneumonia.  However, in the absence of prior images, it is impossible to
 assess whether there has been any resolution of the inflammatory process.
