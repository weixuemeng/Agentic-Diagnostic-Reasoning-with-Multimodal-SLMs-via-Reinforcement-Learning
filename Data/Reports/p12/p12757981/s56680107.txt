                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and rib pain on the right side.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. The heart is mildly enlarged. The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. Fullness of each hilum and indistinctness of pulmonary
 vasculature in conjunction with mild interstitial prominence is most often
 seen with mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Imaging findings suggest mild pulmonary edema; if clinical findings are
 discordant, however, differential of atypical pneumonia could be considered.
