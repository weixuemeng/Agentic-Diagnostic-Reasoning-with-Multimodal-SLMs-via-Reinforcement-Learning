                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib pain after fall. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  There is mild left base
 atelectasis. A trace right pleural effusion is noted. A nodular opacity
 projecting over the left lower lung is again seen, now measuring 7 mm. As
 before, this is consistent with a calcified granuloma. No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is identified.  No fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left base atelectasis.
 2. Small right pleural effusion.
 3. No fracture visualized.
 4. Unchanged nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lobe.
