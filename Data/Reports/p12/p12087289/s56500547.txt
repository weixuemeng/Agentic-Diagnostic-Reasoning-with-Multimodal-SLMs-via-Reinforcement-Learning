                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of severe pulmonary hypertension, radiation fibrosis and
 traction bronchiectasis.  Evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.   
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are minimally hyperinflated.  There is substantial volume loss on
 the right side, which is likely secondary to substantial atelectasis of the
 middle and lower lobes.  Additionally, there are increasing interstitial
 markings on the right side and the interstitial opacities in the left lung
 appear worse compared to the prior study, which is concerning for severe
 atypical pneumonia. There is a rightward shift of the mediastinum and the
 right hilus is rotated medially. There is a very minimal pulmonary effusion on
 the right side.  Again seen is prominence of the aortic knob and left
 pulmonary artery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening interstitial opacities concerning for severe multifocal pneumonia.  
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone at 13:19 on
 ___ 1 hour after discovery by Dr. ___.
