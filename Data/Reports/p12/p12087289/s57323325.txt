                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer in 96 status post right lower lobe
 resection, radiation fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, suspected pneumonia,
 question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 8:38 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film and allowing for differences in technique, there
 is increased opacity at the right base, most suggestive of a small right
 pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is background COPD, with hyperinflation; cardiomegaly with evidence
 of prior sternotomies and mediastinal clips; and probable prominence of the
 left and ? right hila. Also again seen are increased interstitial markings
 throughout the left lung with some more confluent areas peripherally and
 subtler increased interstitial markings in the right upper and adjoining mid
 zone, with some pleural thickening along the right mid-chest laterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Compared with ___, new small right pleural effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change
 
 
 2) Compared with ___, interstitial opacities are significantly more
 pronounced, suggesting superimposed process, possibly superimposed infection. 
 The possibility of a superimposed component of CHF would be difficult to
 exclude. (Note is made that the patient has known background radiation
 fibrosis.)
