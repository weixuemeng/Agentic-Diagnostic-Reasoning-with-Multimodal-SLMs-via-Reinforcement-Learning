  1. Opacity at the right lung base that may represent postsurgical change or
  possibly acute infectious process.  Further evaluation can be made if prior
  chest radiographs are submitted for comparison.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pulmonary hypertension, bronchiectasis and non-small cell
 lung cancer status post resection of his right lower lobe, chemotherapy and
 radiation in ___.  
 
 Shortness of breath, evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a relative lucency of the right upper lung and opacity of the right
 lower lung,  consistent with changes secondary to surgery and radiation. 
 However, the opacity in the right lower lung could also represent acute
 infectious process.  There are diffuse, reticular opacities seen in the left
 lung.  There is obscuration of the aortic knob potentially suggestive of hilar
 adenopathy and enlargement of the left pulmonary artery consistent with
 pulmonary hypertension.  The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Opacity at the right lung base that may represent postsurgical change or
 possibly acute infectious process.  Further evaluation can be made if prior
 chest radiographs are submitted for comparison. 
 
 2. Enlargement of the left pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension.  
 
 These findings were entered as a wet read into the ED dashboard.
