                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung volumes
 results in bronchovascular crowding. The left heart border is not well seen,
 raising the possibility of lingular infection. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Prominent vascular markings may be due to pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are normal allowing for low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Prominent vascular markings may be due to pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Possible lingular infection. A lateral view with better inspiration may be
 helpful for further evaluation.
