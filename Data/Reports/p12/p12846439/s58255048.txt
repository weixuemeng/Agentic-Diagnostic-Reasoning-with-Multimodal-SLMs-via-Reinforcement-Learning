 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multiple right-sided posterior rib fractures.  The fracture of
 the seventh rib appears more angulated on the current study however this may
 in part be due to patient positioning as the patient is somewhat rotated.  No
 pneumothorax seen.  No pleural effusions seen.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent mild angulation of the right seventh rib fracture may in part be due
 to patient positioning.
