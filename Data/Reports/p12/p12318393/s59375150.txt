                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, now
 fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 There is increased airspace opacity in the right upper lung.  Opacity in the
 right lung base appears to be associated with volume loss and likely
 represents atelectasis.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 there is consolidation at the left base. The heart remains enlarged, made more
 striking by portable technique.  The mediastinal contours are notable for
 calcification of the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal pneumonia.
 
 2.  Cardiac enlargement with mild pulmonary edema.
