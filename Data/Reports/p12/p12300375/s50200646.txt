                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/unwitnessed fall.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, but clear.  Heart size is considerably enlarged
 and the aortic arch is markedly calcified.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pleural effusion.  Osseous structures are demineralized and there is mild
 compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body, which is likely chronic.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Hyperinflated lungs likely reflecting COPD.
 2. Considerable cardiomegaly.
 3. No evidence of pneumonia.
