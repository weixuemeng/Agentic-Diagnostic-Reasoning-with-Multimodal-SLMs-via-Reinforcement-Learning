                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypertension and elevated white blood
 cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low suggesting that band like opacity at both lung
 bases is atelectasis, but that could be due to aspiration, so follow up for
 pneumonia is indicated. Lower lung volume exaggerates the profusion of
 interstitial markings and vascularity, but there could be early edema.  There
 is no appreciable pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Significant
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis raises possibility of aspiration. Mild
 pulmonary edema.
