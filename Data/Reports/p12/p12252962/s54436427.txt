                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bacteremia of unclear source.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate an area of focal
 opacification in the right lung base concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. 
 Persistent blunting of both costophrenic angles is consistent with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Again seen is prominence of interstitial
 markings, suggestive of chronic lung disease or elevation of pulmonary
 vascular pressure.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Incidental note is made of a gaseous dilation of the esophagus and a large
 hiatial hernia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the right lung base concerning for aspiration or
 pneumonia.
