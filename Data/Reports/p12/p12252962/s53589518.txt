                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Endocarditis, embolic stroke, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing opacity at
 the right lung base is improved as compared to the previous image.  An
 insufficiently advanced right-sided PICC line has been removed.  Better seen
 than on the previous image, notably given the availability of lateral images,
 are mild bilateral pleural effusions, restricted to the region of the
 costophrenic sinus.  Mild areas of subsequent basal atelectasis are seen
 bilaterally.  Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the left ventricle and
 substantial valvular calcifications.  No pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.
