                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Comparison is made to chest radiograph dated ___.  AP upright and
 lateral chest radiograph demonstrates increased opacity at the right upper
 lobe and right lung base. More linear opacity along the left lung base is
 additionally noted. Though the latter finding may reflect atelectasis, the
 right lung base opacity may reflect an early infectious process.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance. There is no
 pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities which may reflect a component of atelectasis though an
 infectious process cannot be excluded, particularly at the right lung base and
 right upper lobe .
