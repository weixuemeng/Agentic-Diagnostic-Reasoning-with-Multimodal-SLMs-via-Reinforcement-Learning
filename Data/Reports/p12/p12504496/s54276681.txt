                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall and right leg injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Linear opacity at the left lung
 base laterally may be due to atelectasis given relatively lower lung volumes. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is more conspicuous on today's exam.  Blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles may be due to small effusions.  The lungs are
 clear of confluent consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions.  Left base/retrocardiac opacities may
 be due to atelectasis, although clinical correlation suggested regarding
 possibility of infection.
