                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Colon cancer, status post subclavian Port-A-Cath placement. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___.
 
 UPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The new right Port-A-Cath is seen
 with the tip terminating in the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax,
 mediastinal widening or other evidence of procedural complication.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  Heart size is top normal.  There is a probable small
 left layering pleural effusion.  There is slight rightward deviation of the
 superior trachea which may be the result of mass effect from a goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New Port-A-Cath terminating in the low SVC with no pneumothorax or other
 evidence of procedural complication.
 2.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Possible mass effect on the trachea from a goiter.  Correlation with
 physical exam and/or non-emergent thyroid ultrasound is recommended.
