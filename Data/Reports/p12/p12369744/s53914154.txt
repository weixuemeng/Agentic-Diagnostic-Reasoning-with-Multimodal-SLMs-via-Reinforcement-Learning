                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fall s/p ORIF with increased work of
 breathing  // eval for PNM/effusions
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidation, left-greater-than-right has developed since ___ most likely acute aspiration pneumonia. Pleural effusion is small on the
 left, if any. Upper lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary edema or vascular
 congestion despite moderate cardiomegaly and especially left atrial
 enlargement.
 
  Although no fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, aside from a healed
 left middle rib fracture, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient
 for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. Any focal findings
 should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT
 scanning.
