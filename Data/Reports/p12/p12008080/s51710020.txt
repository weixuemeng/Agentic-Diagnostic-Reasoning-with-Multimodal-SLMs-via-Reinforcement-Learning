                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pre-op
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ at 7:40 a.m.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Central pulmonary vessels are
 engorged; however, no overt edema is present.  Bibasilar linear opacities
 reflect mild atelectasis secondary to decreased lung volumes.  At least two
 wedge compression deformities are noted within the mid and lower thoracic
 spine, of unknown chronicity.  Surgical clips overlie the breasts or upper
 abdomen. There is a chronic deformity of the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Wedge compression deformities of the mid and lower thoracic spine of
 unknown chronicity.
