 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 linear right infrahilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Similar band-like opacity suggesting minor atelectasis or scarring
 in the right lower lung with no definite acute disease.
