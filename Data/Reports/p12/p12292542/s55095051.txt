                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases. Streaky opacities within
 the lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
