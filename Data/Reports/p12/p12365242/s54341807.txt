                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA & lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and EKG changes.  Evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 REPORT.  
 
 Mild rotation.  Allowing for this, the heart size is probably at the upper
 limits of normal for size.  Lung bases not particularly well seen particularly
 the left costophrenic sulcus and effusion here cannot be immediately out ruled
 but this likely reflects a combination of poor respiratory effort and also
 perhaps some splinting from the multiple distended loops of bowel incidentally
 observed.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  The visualized osseous
 structures appear grossly normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Respiratory effort, but likely no acute lung process.  Minimal left
 costophrenic sulcus is seen and minimal congestive changes are not excluded. 
 Incidentally noted are multiple distended loops of likely colon.  Please
 correlate clinically.
