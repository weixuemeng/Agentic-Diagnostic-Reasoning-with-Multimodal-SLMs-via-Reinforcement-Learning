                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB and recent pneumonia  // evidence of
 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe emphysema there is responsible for marked pulmonary hyperinflation.
 Multiple bronchial valve were placed in the right lung on or about ___.
 Peribronchial infiltration may have been present as early as ___ but
 had clearly progressed to extensive heterogeneous consolidation on ___. The process was largely in the right upper lobe, anterior and posterior
 segments,  but peribronchial infiltration was visible in the right middle and
 lower lobes. Since ___ there has been no improvement in the upper lobe
 posterior segmental involvement, minimal improvement in the anterior segmental
 involvement and substantial clearing of peribronchial right middle and lower
 lobes. The abnormality could be either infection, involving lungs and
 bronchial tree, and/or hemorrhage. Lung nodules have been reported on prior
 chest CTs. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and there is no pleural
 effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Large right upper lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia versus
 hemorrhage little change since ___. Concurrent peribronchial
 infiltration in the right middle and lower lobes has improved.
