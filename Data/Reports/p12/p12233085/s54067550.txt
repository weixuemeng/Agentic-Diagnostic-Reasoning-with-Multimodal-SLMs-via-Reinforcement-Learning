                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath/volume overload s/p left
 heart cath s/p DES.  // Evaluate for edema     Evaluate for edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is at the
 upper limits of normal in size.  The configuration of the mediastinal contour
 is again consistent with known radiation fibrosis with associated
 bronchiectasis of the upper lobes.
 There is interval increase in the indistinctness and engorgement of pulmonary
 vessels, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of volume overload.  Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with layering effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases.
