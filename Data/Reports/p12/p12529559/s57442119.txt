                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fluid crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 medial right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis, although it is more
 prominent as compared to the prior study.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis and
 confluence of vascular structures; however, infectious process is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
