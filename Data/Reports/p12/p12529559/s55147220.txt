 ___ 18:19.
 
 Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  Lungs are well expanded
 and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  No pleural
 abnormality.  Lateral view does not show substantial calcification in the
 aortic valve, a potential cause of syncope due to aortic stenosis, but that
 finding can be missed on conventional chest radiographs.
