 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS  // interval change

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, worse on the right lung, has
 not changed appreciably over the past 3 days.  Heart size is normal, smaller
 than on some prior images during this hospitalization.  Heart failure is no
 longer contributory to the diffuse pulmonary abnormality, probably a
 combination of pneumonia and ARDS.
 
 Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube, and nasogastric
 tube, right-sided central venous catheter are in standard placements
 respectively
