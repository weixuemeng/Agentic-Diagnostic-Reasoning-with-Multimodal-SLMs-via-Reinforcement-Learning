                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 The mass like quality of the opacity above the left hilus and the accompanying
 change in the contour of the aortic arch which raises the possibility of
 lymphadenopathy strongly indicates that follow up is necessary to exclude
 malignancy.
 
 The above addendum was submitted to the radiology dasbhoard on ___ at
 6pm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and malaise, history of
 COPD, any pulmonary infiltrates?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Mild widening
 and elongation of the thoracic aorta is noted as before.  No local contour
 abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is
 now a sizable parenchymal infiltrate occupying the left upper lobe as seen on
 the frontal view.  The lateral view discloses its location in the posterior
 apical segment of the left upper lobe sparing; however, the lingula.  No other
 pulmonary acute processes are seen and the right and left lateral as well as
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Similar as on
 the preceding examination, the general configuration of pulmonary vasculature
 and thorax with increased depth diameter and low positioned diaphragms is
 consistent with COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of acute parenchymal infiltrate in left upper lobe
 lateral and apical segment consistent with pneumonia.  Followup examination
 after successful treatment is recommended.
