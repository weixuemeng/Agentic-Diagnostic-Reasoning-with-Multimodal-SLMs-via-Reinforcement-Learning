                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large mass is present in the left upper lobe measuring
 approximately 6.4 x 7.1 cm in diameter, and was previously partially obscured
 by adjacent focus of consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 Left hilum is difficult to assess due to obscuration by the adjacent mass. 
 Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.  Left hemidiaphragm is mildly
 elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left upper lobe lung mass, highly concerning for primary
 lung cancer. This may be associated with airway involvement given its
 proximity to the hilum and the presence of a postobstructive pneumonia on
 previous imaging of ___.  
 
 Findings communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:05
 a.m. at the time of discovery with recommendation for repeat chest CT to guide
 further diagnosis of this presumed lung cancer.
