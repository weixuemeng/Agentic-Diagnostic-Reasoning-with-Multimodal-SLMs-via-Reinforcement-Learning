 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by worsening asymmetrically distributed diffuse heterogeneous lung
 opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged.
