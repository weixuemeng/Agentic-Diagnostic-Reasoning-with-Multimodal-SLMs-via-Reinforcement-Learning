                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There blunting of the right lateral costophrenic sulcus with associated mild
 volume loss in the right hemi thorax. Lungs appear hyperinflated with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms. . There is no evidence of focal
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Incompletely imaged metallic hardware is
 noted along the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of right costophrenic sulcus favors pleural thickening in the setting
 of mild right sided volume loss. Comparison to older radiographs would be
 helpful to document stability. If unavailable, short-term followup radiographs
 in ___ weeks may be helpful to exclude an active process.
