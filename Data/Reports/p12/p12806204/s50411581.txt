                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight gain and CHF.  Evaluation for evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___
 as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate dual lead left-sided
 pacemaker in unchanged position with leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Since the prior study, there has been interval development of a
 moderate left pleural effusion, as well as blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle representing a small pleural effusion, perhaps slightly increased since
 the prior.  Additionally, there is persistence of curved opacity along the
 lateral right pleural surface which is unchanged since the prior study and
 could be due to a loculated pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  There is
 also evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and fluid overload with
 pulmonary edema, more prominent on the right.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is atelectasis at the left lung base, however an infectious component
 cannot be completely excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and trace on the right
 with likely a loculated component on the lateral right pleural surface.  
 
 2. Pulmonary edema, more prominent on the right.
 
 3. Left basilar atelectasis.  Underlying infectious component cannot be
 completely excluded.
