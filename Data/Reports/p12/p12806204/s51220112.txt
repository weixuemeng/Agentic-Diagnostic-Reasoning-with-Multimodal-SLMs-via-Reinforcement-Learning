                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with small left-sided pneumothorax status post pacemaker,
 eval pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 A lucency along the left lateral chest wall is unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of mediastinal shift or apical pneumothoraces.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are stable.  The lobulated pleural thickening on the right
 chest wall is unchanged in appearance.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lucency along the left lateral chest wall is small and stable in
 size, and more likely reflects a skinfold rather than pneumothorax.
