                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are stable.  A subtle left base opacity is seen which could be due to
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Slight prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature may be due to central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Somewhat curved opacity along the pleura of the right mid
 hemithorax may be due to loculated pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity along the right mid hemithorax which appears
 pleural-based may be due to loculated pleural fluid or pleural thickening. 
 There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may also be due
 to a trace effusion.  Findings could be further evaluated on chest CT.  A
 subtle left base opacity is seen which could be due to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
