                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, status post open right colectomy, now with new
 O2-requirement and diminished breath sounds at the right lung base; evaluate
 for fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views are compared with the radiographs of ___, as well
 as appropriate portions of the NECT torso, dated ___.  There is now
 significant pneumoperitoneum, related to the interval laparotomy.  There are
 low lung volumes with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely
 postoperative, as well.  Allowing for this, there is some pulmonary vascular
 congestion with bilateral pleural effusions, likely related to volume
 overload.  There is no overt alveolar edema and no definite focal
 consolidation.
 
 Again demonstrated are:  Atherosclerosis involving the thoracic aorta, diffuse
 osteopenia, and A/C arthrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Post-operative pneumoperitoneum and low lung volumes and bibasilar
 subsegmental atelectasis.
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion which may reflect volume overload, but
 should be correlated clinically.
