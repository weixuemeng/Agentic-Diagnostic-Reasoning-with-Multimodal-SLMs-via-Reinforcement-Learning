                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cecal cancer status post open right
 colectomy with shortness of breath.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable AP upright radiograph was obtained.  Since the previous study, lung
 volumes decreased.  Increased perihilar haze and thickened septal lines is
 compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Left greater than right
 small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are also be present.  Heart
 size appears increased as well allowing for differences in AP and PA
 technique.  Imaged upper abdomen demonstrates prominent bowel loops and should
 be correlated clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of mild to moderate pulmonary edema with unchanged
 bilateral effusions.
 2.  Prominent bowel loops should be correlated with examination findings.
