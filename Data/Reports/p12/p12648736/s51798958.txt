                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain, lethargy, history of melanoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, with catheter terminating in the region of
 the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Persistent right peritracheal
 mediastinal/hilar opacity corresponds to known lymphadenopathy/mediastinal
 masses.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is likely due to a small right pleural effusion
 overlying an elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation or evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.
