                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Infusion port not functioning.  Please confirm placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Course of the left subclavian infusion port has changed since ___. 
 We have no intervening chest radiographs.  The most internal aspect of the
 catheter is oriented more horizontally today than it was in ___ when it was
 directed obliquely inferior.  It may still be within the upper-to-mid SVC. 
 Occasionally, the course of indwelling catheters is deflected by developing
 thrombus, which cannot be diagnosed by conventional radiographs.  Most recent
 cross-sectional imaging of the chest, torso CT on ___ showed that
 the change in direction has taken place subsequently, but this could be due to
 change in the disposition of large central lymph nodes which may have
 decreased in the interim.  If patency and position of the catheter are at
 issue, then a CT with contrast would be required.
 
 Elevation of the right lung base due to combination of small right pleural
 effusion and elevated right hemidiaphragm is more pronounced today than it was
 in ___.  The lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.
