                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is opacification at
 both bases, more prominent on the left, consistent with pleural effusion and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 essentially unchanged, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion in this
 patient with evidence of previous CABG procedure and intact midline sternal
 wires.
 
 Right IJ catheter again extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
