                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest/arm pain.  No leukocytosis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Mild streaky
 atelectasis at the bilateral lung bases.  There is a rounded opacity seen at
 the posterior left chest base.  This is most likely a small Bochdalek's hernia
 and is best seen on the lateral view.  However, focal consolidation is not
 excluded.  If there is high concern, this could be further evaluated with CT
 scan.  Multilevel moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 present.  No priors are available for comparison.
