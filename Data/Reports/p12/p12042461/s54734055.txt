                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is moderately
 enlarged.  The left PICC has been removed.  Previously noted right perihilar
 consolidation appears slightly improved when compared to the prior study,
 suggestive of residual pneumonia.  Additionally, there is mild pulmonary
 edema.  A moderate-sized right pleural effusion is present, similar compared
 to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved but persistent right perihilar consolidative
 opacity likely representing residual pneumonia.  There is mild pulmonary edema
 and a small- to moderate-sized right pleural effusion which is similar when
 compared to the prior study.
