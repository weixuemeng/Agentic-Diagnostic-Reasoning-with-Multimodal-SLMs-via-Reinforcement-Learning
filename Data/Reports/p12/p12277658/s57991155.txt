                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  At the left lung base, there is a subtle 1-cm
 rounded opacity which may relate to overlying structures; however, underlying
 pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  The lungs are clear elsewhere.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable 1-cm nodular opacity at the left lung base in this
 patient with low lung volumes.  Recommend repeat with deep inspiration or
 nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.
