  Right basilar opacity likely due to partially loculated effusion and
  atelectasis.  Additional etiologies such as infection or underlying lesion are
  possible.  Small left pleural effusion.  Additional nodular opacity projecting
  over the right mid to upper lung.  This is suspicious for underlying pulmonary
  nodule.  Dedicated chest CT is suggested to further characterize these
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with sob  // Pleural effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is right basilar opacity which is likely in part due to an effusion
 potentially with some loculation and with atelectasis.  There is also small
 left pleural effusion.  Rounded opacity projects over the right mid to upper
 lung suspicious for underlying pulmonary nodule although not clearly localized
 on lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips project over the neck on the
 left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
