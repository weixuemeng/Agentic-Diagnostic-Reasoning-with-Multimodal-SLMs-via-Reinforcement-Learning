                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral pleural effusions, intubated //
 confirm OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 06:02.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A enteric tube has been placed terminating in the stomach with side port
 beyond expected location of the gastroesophageal junction.  The endotracheal
 tube is in appropriate position, appearing closer to the carina than on
 previous same-day radiograph because the patient's chin is down.  Moderate
 right and small left left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are
 stable.  Vascular congestion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube in appropriate position. Otherwise no interval change.
