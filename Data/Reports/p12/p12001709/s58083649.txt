                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is listed currently as EU critical at the time
 of study interpretation.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 3.6 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube
 is noted which courses below the diaphragm, and into the stomach, with the tip
 off the inferior borders of the film.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the left lung base likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
