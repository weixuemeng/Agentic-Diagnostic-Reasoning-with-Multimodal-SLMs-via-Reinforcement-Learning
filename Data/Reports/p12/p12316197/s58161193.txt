                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  Patchy opacity within the retrocardiac region most likely reflects
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.  Infection however in the
 correct clinical setting is not excluded.
