                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with low lung volumes on V/Q lung scan,
 assess for atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Markedly distended bowel loops are observed and probably were
 related to the very high positioned diaphragms.  Bilateral plate atelectases
 are observed, a major one projecting into the mid lung field and posteriorly. 
 Acute pulmonary infiltrates cannot be identified.  There is no pneumothorax in
 the apical area and no gross cardiac enlargement is present.  There exists no
 prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest views confirm the nuclear scan impression of
 markedly elevated diaphragms.
