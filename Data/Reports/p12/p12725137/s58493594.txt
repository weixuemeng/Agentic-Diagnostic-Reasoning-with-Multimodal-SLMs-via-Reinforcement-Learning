 of the right heart border.  There is, however, evidence of at least
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary vascular congestion, and
 moderate to severe bilateral pulmonary edema.There is a small left pleural
 effusion as well as an adjacent focal consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion.

 however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Moderate to severe bilateral pulmonary edema.
