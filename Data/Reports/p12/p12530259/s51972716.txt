                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post thoracotomy and left lower lobe
 lobectomy, now requiring assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate interval worsening
 of left lung opacity.  The entire left hemithorax is now again opacified. 
 Opacification is likely due to a large left pleural fluid collection in the
 setting of lobectomy versus less likely left lung collapse.  There is
 persistent significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed
 due to obscuration by the left hemithorax opacification.  The mediastinum is
 not shifted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the opacification of left hemithorax, likely
 consistent with large left pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear.
