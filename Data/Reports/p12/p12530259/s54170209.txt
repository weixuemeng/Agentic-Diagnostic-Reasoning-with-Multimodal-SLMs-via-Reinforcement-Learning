                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New left apical pneumothorax, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The left-sided chest tube is again seen, unchanged.  Compared with earlier the
 same day (7:29 a.m.), the small left apical pneumothorax is again noted,
 itself unchanged.  However, on the current exam, air is noted along the medial
 surface of the left lung.  This may represent a portion of the apical
 pneumothorax that is dissecting medially or, alternatively, a small 
 pneumomediastinum.  In retrospect, this may have been present on the earlier
 film, but is better seen on the current exam due to increased contrast.  It
 was not clearly present on ___ film. Again seen is subcutaneous emphysema,
 which appears bmore pronounced.
 
 Opacity at the left base shows some interval improvement, with the elevated
 left hemidiaphragm now better defined.  Some residual atelectasis and/or
 consolidation and residual pleural fluid  are likely present.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Small left apical ptx is unchanged, but ?small medial ptx vs
 pneumomediastinum along upper left lung medially. Subcutaneous emphysema has
 likely also progressed.
 
 2) Interval improvement in left base opacity.
 
 Findings paged to the ordering house officer at approximately 4:10 p.m. on the
 day of exam. At approximately 7 pm, findings were discussed with covering
 house officer (___, phone).
