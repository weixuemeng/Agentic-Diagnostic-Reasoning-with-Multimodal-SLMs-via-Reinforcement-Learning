                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bronch, question interval improvement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day (12:17), there is somewhat improved
 aeration in the left lung.  A dense opacity previously seen in the left mid
 and upper zones now shows partial aeration with residual patchy opacity.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is likely still elevated.  No definite pneumothorax is
 identified.  Subcutaneous emphysema again noted.  Left chest tube is present,
 unchanged.  Aside from some atelectasis at the right base and possible minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, the right lung remains grossly
 clear.  Mediastinum remains midline.  The tracheal contour is grossly
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial reexpansion of the left lung.  Probable elevated left
 hemidiaphragm.
