 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post left lower lobe lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to prior study from a day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Opacification of the left hemithorax is a combination of increasing pleural
 effusion and a presumed increasing atelectasis in the remaining left upper
 lobe.  Cardiomediastinal contours are midline.  There is probably a tiny
 residual left apical pneumothorax.  The right lower lobe atelectasis has
 improved.  Left IJ catheter tip is unchanged.  Left chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema has improved.
