                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with metastatic adenocarcinoma and failure to
 thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest performed 30 minutes
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  Portable frontal chest radiograph shows no significant
 change in previously described left lung opacification and volume loss,
 compatible with collapse, with elevation of a probably paralyzed left
 hemidiaphragm.  The right lung remains clear.  Further evaluation with CT
 would provide a better evaluation of the airways to evaluate for cause of
 collapse.
