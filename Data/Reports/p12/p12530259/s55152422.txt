                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left lower lobectomy, question interval change.
 
 CHEST (PA & LAT)
 
 Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema over the left lung.  This
 limits assessment for a small pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Compared
 with ___, no definite interval change in these findings is
 detected, though they are less distinct on the current exam.  
 Left chest tube is again noted.  
 
 There is now increased opacity in the left mid zone, though the left
 hemidiaphragm also appears elevated, which could reflect volume loss status
 post left lower lobe lobectomy.  The mediastinum itself remains midline.  The
 right lung is blurred due to respiratory motion, but is grossly clear.
