                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer presenting with chronic
 cough and failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exams performed ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate interval
 increase in opacification of the left chest, with interval increase in left
 hemidiaphragmatic elevation likely the result of phrenic nerve paralysis. 
 There is minimal residual aerated left lung in this patient who is status post
 left upper lobectomy.  The right lung is hyperexpanded and clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Collapse of the remaining left lung with further elevation of a
 probably paralyzed left hemidiaphragm.  Further evaluation with CT would
 provide a better evaluation of the airways and for the etiology of lung
 collapse.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the MICU at 10am by phone.
