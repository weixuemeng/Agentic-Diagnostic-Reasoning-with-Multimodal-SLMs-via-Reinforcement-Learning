 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal.  There is mild widening of the mediastinum, as

 mediastinal abnormality.  No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia are
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.

 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Mild widening of the mediastinum, with associated convexity of the
 aortopulmonary window, atypical in a patient of this age.  Alhtough possibly
 due to prominent mediastinal fat (lipomatosis), a nonurgent chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation, to exclude malignancy such as lymphoma.
