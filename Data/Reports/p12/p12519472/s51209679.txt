                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF.  Post-op day 1 from ORIF with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT cervical spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is mild interstitial prominence, slightly improved
 from the prior exam.  This likely represents mild pulmonary edema.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Again, the trachea is
 deviated rightward, due to a known thyroid nodule identified on the CT of the
 cervical spine.  The heart is moderately enlarged, and unchanged from the
 prior exam.  A gas bubble in the retrocardiac area is likely due to a hiatal
 hernia.  A large soft tissue prominence over the right shoulder is likely a
 hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved from the prior exam.
 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Retrocardiac gas bubble is likely due to a hiatal hernia.
