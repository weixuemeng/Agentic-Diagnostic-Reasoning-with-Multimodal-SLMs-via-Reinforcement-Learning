                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  RML lobectomy with chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest
 tube has been removed and there is a small pneumothorax that may be slightly
 greater than on the previous study.  The degree of subcutaneous emphysema
 along the right lateral chest wall is decreasing.  Otherwise, little change in
 the appearance of the heart and lungs.
