                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ams concerning for seizure vs stroke now
 with acute SOB // Please assess for SOB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Again noted is a
 tortuous aorta.  In comparison to the priors, there is persistent pulmonary
 vascular congestion, possibly slightly progressed, though likely exaggerated
 due to low lung volumes.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, though the semi-upright technique limits evaluation.  Again noted
 is a 2 lead left-sided pacemaker with the leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
