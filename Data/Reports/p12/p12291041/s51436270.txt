                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ams  // pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous. 
 There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal left mid to lower lung linear atelectasis/scarring is seen. 
 No lobar consolidation is seen.  No large pleural effusion is seen although a
 small pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude on the right.  There is a
 dual lead left-sided pacemaker with leads extending the expected positions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be due to cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion.  Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.
