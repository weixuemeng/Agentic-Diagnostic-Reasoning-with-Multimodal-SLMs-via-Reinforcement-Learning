                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with fatigue; evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is limited, secondary to respiratory motion artifact.  The
 patient is then slightly towards the left.  Lung volumes are slightly low, but
 similar to the prior exam.  Right infrahilar opacity most likely reflects
 atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding, not definitely appreciated on the
 lateral view.  In the appropriate clinical situation, an early bronchovascular
 pneumonia is possible.  Retrocardiac streak like opacities are similar the
 prior exam and are also consistent with atelectasis. No edema, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The left dual lead pacemaker device appears grossly intact and
 unchanged in position.  Extensive aortic knob calcifications are unchanged. 
 Diffuse calcification of the trachea is within normal limits for the patient's
 age and unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.
