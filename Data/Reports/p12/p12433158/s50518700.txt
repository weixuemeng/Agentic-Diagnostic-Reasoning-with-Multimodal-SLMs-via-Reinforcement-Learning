                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There
 appears to be blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle, which may be
 due to very trace pleural effusion.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Again seen is dual-lead left-sided
 pacemaker with leads in the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
