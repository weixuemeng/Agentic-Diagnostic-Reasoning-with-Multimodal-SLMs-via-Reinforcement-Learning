                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart appears likely at the upper limits of normal size although not
 optimally assessed.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is a
 confluent right infrahilar opacity in the right lower lung with Kerley B lines
 and blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle, quite asymmetric. Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity is less specific but an additional focus of pneumonia
 could be considered versus atelectasis.  There is mild background perihilar
 fullness suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension or slight fluid overload,
 but not substantial.  Each costophrenic sulcus is blunted which may suggest
 pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive right infrahilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show resolution.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity, possibly atelectasis or pneumonia.  Findings also suggestive of mild
 vascular congestion or fluid overload.
