                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.   Projecting over the right costophrenic angle is a nodular
 focus consistent with a nipple shadow.  A mild compression deformity of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body appears stable and probably chronic.  A L1
 compression body fracture is also stable.  A partly visualized prior healed
 impacted fracture of the proximal right humerus is also noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
