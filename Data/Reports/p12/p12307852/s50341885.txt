                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough fall, ataxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Aortic calcification is again seen.  Stable mild compression
 deformities in the mid thoracic spine are noted.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.  However if clinical clinical concern for rib fracture is high,
 dedicated rib series or chest CT are more sensitive.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
