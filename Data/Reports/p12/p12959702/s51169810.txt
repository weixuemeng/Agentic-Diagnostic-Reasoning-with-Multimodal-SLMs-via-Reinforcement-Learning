                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 Heterogeneous opacification with predominant interstitial patterns are seen in
 the bilateral lower lobes, right side more than left with some septal lines. 
 Although the lung findings are consistent with pulmonary edema and there are
 tiny pleural effusions, the heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal
 sihouettes are normal, so typical pneumonia should be considered as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema or interstitial pneumonia.
