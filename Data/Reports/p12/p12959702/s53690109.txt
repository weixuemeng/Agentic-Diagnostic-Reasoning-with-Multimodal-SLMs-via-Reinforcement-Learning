                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not dilated.  Diffuse
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality with basilar predominance could represent
 either edema or atypical pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 stable.
 
 If this abnormality is not pulmonary edema and persists beyond the anticipated
 duration of atypical pneumonia, other considerations such as lymphoma should
 be entertained.
