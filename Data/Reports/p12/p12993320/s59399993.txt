 AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST ___ AT 19:49 HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly improved over the prior exam, no definite
 consolidation or edema is noted.  Again seen is an ill-defined density which
 projects at the intersection of the anterior right third and posterior right
 seventh rib.  This remains of unclear etiology but is reassuring given that it
 again is situated over osseous structures.  The aorta remains markedly
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged even accounting for patient and
 technical factors.  Both findings are stable.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic
 spine and in the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.  Hypertensive cardiomediastinal
 configuration is again noted.  The density projecting over the lateral right
 hemithorax tracts with osseous structures and most likely is osseous in
 etiology although pulmonary nodules not entirely excluded.  Consider nonurgent
 workup with oblique and lordotic views versus CT.
