                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ASD closure  // left chest tube position   
 left chest tube position
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 22:48.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left pleural drain crosses the left hemi thorax at mid level, with the tip
 impinging on the mediastinum at the midline.  Small left pneumothorax is
 substantially smaller, and previous left lower lobe atelectasis largely
 resolved.  The same is true for the right hemi thorax, except there is more
 residual right lower lobe and right middle lobe atelectasis and I see no
 thoracostomy tube on that side ; presumably there was an interval right
 thoracentesis.  .  Pneumo mediastinum at the thoracic inlet and subcutaneous
 emphysema in the neck is stable.  Heart size normal.  No pulmonary edema.
