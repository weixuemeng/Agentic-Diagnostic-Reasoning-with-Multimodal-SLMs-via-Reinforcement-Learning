                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p ASD repair  // ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the left chest tube is been removed.  No definite
 pneumothorax is identified.  However, the flattened appearance of the left
 base opacity could reflect a subtle hydro pneumothorax.  No associated lucency
 is identified to confirm this.  Small bilateral effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis are otherwise similar to the prior study.  No CHF or new
 infiltrate is identified.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of left chest tube.  No definite pneumothorax, though
 flattened appearance of the left pleural effusion raises the question of
 occult hydro pneumothorax.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help
 for further assessment.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
