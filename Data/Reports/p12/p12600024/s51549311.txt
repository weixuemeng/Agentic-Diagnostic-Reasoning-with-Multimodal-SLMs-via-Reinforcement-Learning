                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  Left
 hilum appears somewhat enlarged compared to prior study, but again this may be
 due to low lung volumes.   There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Pleural thickening and scarring within the right lung base is unchanged as is
 a linear opacity within the superior segment of the right lower lobe
 compatible scarring.  Minimal left retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No left-sided pleural effusion is seen, and there is no
 pneumothorax.  Multilevel severe degenerative changes of the thoracic spine
 are present.  Clip is seen within the right anterior chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  This causes enlargement of the left hilum, as well as
 bronchovascular crowding and mild left basilar atelectasis. Repeat PA and
 lateral views with improved inspiratory effort is recommended to better assess
 the left hilum and left lung base.
 
 2. Chronic pleural thickening and scarring within the right lung base.
