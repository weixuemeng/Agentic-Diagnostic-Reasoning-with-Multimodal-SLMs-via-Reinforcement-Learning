                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever with left opacity seen on AP film.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the opacification in the left mid zone, which is projected
 posteriorly on the lateral view.  This is consistent with consolidation in the
 superior segment of the lower lobe.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 persists.
 
 Repeat study after four-six weeks of treatment is suggested to ensure complete
 clearing of this apparent infectious process.
