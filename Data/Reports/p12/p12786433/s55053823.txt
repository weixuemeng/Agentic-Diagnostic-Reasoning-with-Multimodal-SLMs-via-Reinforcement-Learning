 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged obliteration of the
 right heart border, caused by a known pectus deformity.
 
 In addition, however, in the medial parts of the lower lobe, a zone of
 increased radiodensity is seen. On the lateral image, the zone projects
 directly behind the heart than show several air bronchograms.  The zone could
 reflect an area of chronic recurrent infection. The change could be further
 worked up by CT.
