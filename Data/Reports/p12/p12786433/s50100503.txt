                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia at end of ___ per xray.  //
 Please re-evaluate area seen on CXR ___: "In addition, however, in the medial
 parts of the lower lobe, a zone of increased radiodensity is seen. On the
 lateral image, the zone projects directly behind the heart than show several
 air bronchograms.  The zone could reflect an area of chronic recurrent
 infection. The change could be further worked up by CT."
 
 TECHNIQUE:   PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in appearance.  As seen
 previously, there is nonvisualization of the right heart border secondary to
 known pectus deformity.  The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 There are no pneumothoraces or effusions seen.
 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 The lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidation. The previously
 visualized areas of increased radiodensity associated with air bronchograms
 have resolved, and are not seen on the current study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of previously visualized areas of radiodensity with air
 bronchograms. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
