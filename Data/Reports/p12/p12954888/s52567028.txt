  1. Hypoinflated lungs with mild vascular congestion and trace left pleural
  effusion.
  2. New left lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis however pneumonia
  cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
  3. Support lines and tubes as described above.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with post intubation. Assess endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric feeding tube is seen coursing mid line with tip out of field of view. 
 The endotracheal tube is at the level of the clavicles, 1.9 cm above the level
 of the carina in appropriate position.  Intact sternotomy wires.
 
 Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral perihilar interstitial prominence consistent
 with vascular crowding and vascular congestion given cephalization. New left
 lower lobe heterogeneous opacity.  Trace left pleural effusion. No right
 pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Hypoinflated lungs exaggerate mild vascular congestion.  Probable small
 left pleural effusion.
 2.  New left lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis however
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3.  Support lines and tubes as described above.
