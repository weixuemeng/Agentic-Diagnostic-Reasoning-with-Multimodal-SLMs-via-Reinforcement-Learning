                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of myasthenia crisis,
 admitted to the ICU for respiratory monitoring. Evaluate the position of the
 Dobbhoff.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube, which is seen coursing inferior to the
 diaphragm with its tip in the expected location of the stomach in the left
 upper quadrant. Low lung volumes persist. Stable bilateral small effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis. Apparent mediastinal widening is secondary to lack of
 full inspiration. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and contours are unchanged.
 There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Sternotomy
 wires are intact and unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip in the expected location of the stomach.
 
 No interval change in the bilateral effusions.
