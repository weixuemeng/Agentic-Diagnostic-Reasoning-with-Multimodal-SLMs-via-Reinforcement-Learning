  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominence of the
  upper mediastinum likely represents tortuous central vessels though trachea
  appears to have a slight leftward shift.  Other differential possibilities
  include greater or lymphadenopathy.  Comparison with prior studies,
  particularly cross sectional, would be definitive.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with fever after a history
 of non-ST elevation MI.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal but it might be exaggerated by the portable and
 lordotic nature of this study.  The mediastinum appears to be slightly widened
 again projectional and due to the manubrium of sternum projecting over the
 upper mediastinum.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
