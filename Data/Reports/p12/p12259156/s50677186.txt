                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with ST elevation MI.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, unchanged.  There is slight interval
 improvement of the left basal consolidation.  Minimal amount of pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Widening of the upper mediastinum might be
 related to a combination of thyroid gland and sternum and should be correlated
 with thyroid ultrasound.
