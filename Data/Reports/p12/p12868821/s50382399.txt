                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with meningioma presenting with left hip pain
 and encephalopathy  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been placement of a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip
 at the cavoatrial junction. There are markedly low lung volumes which limits
 evaluation. This causes atelectasis of the lung bases. Evaluation for subtle
 consolidation at the bases is limited. There are no pneumothoraces. There are
 no signs for overt pulmonary edema
