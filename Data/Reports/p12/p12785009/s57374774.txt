                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p cardiac arrest  // r/o head bleed
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip residing 4.2 cm above the carinal. The orogastric tube extends into the
 left upper quadrant with the tip residing in the expected region of the
 gastric fundus. Coarsened reticular markings with a lower lobe predominant
 pattern suggests interstitial fibrosis. The heart is mildly enlarged. Blunted
 right CP angle may reflect pleural thickening.  No supine evidence for
 pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and OG tubes positioned appropriately. Coarsened lung markings concerning
 for pulmonary fibrosis.
