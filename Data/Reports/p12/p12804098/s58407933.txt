                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Iliac abscess, now with cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease without evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen with tortuosity of
 the aorta, though there is no definite vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.
