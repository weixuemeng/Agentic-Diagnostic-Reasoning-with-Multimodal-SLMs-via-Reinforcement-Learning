                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever of unknown origin  // evaluate cause
 of respiratory distress
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomegaly is accompanied
 by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.  Worsening interstitial opacities
 in small pleural effusions are likely due to hydrostatic edema and less likely
 an atypical pneumonia.  No definite new or worsening areas of consolidation to
 suggest bacterial pneumonia.
