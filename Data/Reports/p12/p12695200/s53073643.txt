                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Within differences in technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Vague opacities at the lung
 bases can probably be attributed to minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with suspected minor atelectasis, but no definite evidence of
 acute cardiopulmonary disease.
