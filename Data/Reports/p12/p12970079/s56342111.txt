                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent line placement, concern for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and CT from ___.
 
 TWO PORTABLE ERECT VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 A right-sided internal jugular line is unchanged in correct position.  A
 right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to low SVC.  Previous left-sided
 subclavian line has been removed.
 
 There are bibasilar opacities consistent with streaky atelectasis; however,
 there is also a slightly asymmetric appearance of pulmonary opacities which
 could be related to an atypical infectious process, less likely pulmonary
 edema given the configuration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Asymmetric pulmonary opacities on
 this radiograph.  Suggest continued follow up to evaluate for the possibility
 of atypical pneumonia.
