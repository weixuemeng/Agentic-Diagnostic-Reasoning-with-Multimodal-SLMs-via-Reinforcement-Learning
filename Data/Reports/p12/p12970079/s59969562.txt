                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiograph from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that
 extends up to the carina.  An orogastric tube courses across the left
 hemidiaphragm into the stomach, its distal course not visualized.  The lung
 volumes are low.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A patchy right
 infrahilar opacity appears unchanged and may be due to minor atelectasis. 
 However, in the left mid to lower lung, there is a vague but new suggested
 opacity.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube extending up to the carina.  Findings were discussed
 with Dr. ___ at the time of this dictation at 6:45 p.m. by telephone.  At
 that time, the finding of a low endotracheal tube had already been identified
 and corrected.
 
 2.  Vague new suspected left mid to lower lung opacity raising concern for
 atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration; re-evaluation in short-term follow-up is
 recommended.
