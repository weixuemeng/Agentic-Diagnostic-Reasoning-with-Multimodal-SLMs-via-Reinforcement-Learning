                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  The cardiac silhouette has decreased in size and the vascular
 pedicle width has markedly decreased since the prior study.  This may reflect
 improved volume status of the patient.  There remains mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bilateral pleural effusions have markedly decreased in size since
 the prior study, and there is associated improving aeration at the lung bases
 with decreasing bibasilar atelectasis.
