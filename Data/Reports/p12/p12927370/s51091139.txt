                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman on treatment for TB, now with influenza like
 illness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 Scarring is noted right upper lobe with a 12 mm circular opacity noted,
 potentially an area of cavitation. Linear opacities within the right middle
 lobe are compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 12 mm circular opacity within the right upper lobe could potentially reflect a
 cavitary lesion given the patient's history of tuberculosis.  No focal
 consolidation otherwise demonstrated.
