 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with abnormal lung exam  // R/O infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 Right lower lung linear opacities are most likely consistent with areas of
 atelectasis with no evidence of definitive infectious process demonstrated. 
 Substantial kyphosis degrades the quality of the lateral view. Pleural
 thickening is suspected. If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT
 might be considered
