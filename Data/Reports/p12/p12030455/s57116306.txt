  R PICC removed.  ETT is 4 cm from carina.  Low lung volumes with new discoid
  atelectasis in the right mid lung.  Persistent L lung patchy opacities,
  presumably edema.   Retrocardiac opacity may be atelectasis or pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Anoxic brain injury, intubation, assessment of the
 chest tube.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  Lower lung volumes with new discoid
 atelectasis in the right mid lung are noted.  The left lung patchy opacities
 are diffuse, unchanged.  The appearance most likely reflects pulmonary edema. 
 Overall, there is progression of those abnormalities as compared to prior
 study obtained several hours earlier.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Right
 internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
