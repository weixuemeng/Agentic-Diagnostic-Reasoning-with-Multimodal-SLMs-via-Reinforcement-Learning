                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polysubstance abuse and multiple side disorders who was found down. 
 Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right IJ catheter terminates in the right atrium about 1 cm below the
 superior cavoatrial junction, however this is somewhat exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  The tip of the OG tube is not definitely visualized.  The ET tube is
 in appropriate position 4 cm from the carina.  The lung volumes are low.  The
 lungs appear asymmetric with greater opacity projecting over the left lung
 unchanged since yesterday. The heart and mediastinum are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Greater opacity projecting over the left lung may represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, posteriorly layering pleural effusion, or aspiration.  Given
 the recent history of right mainstem bronchus intubation with left lung
 collapse this may represent post expansion edema, although it has persisted
 longer than expected.  If clinically indicated consider repeat CXR after
 respiratory therapy, positioning the patient upright or in reverse
 Trendelenburg to clear edema or redistribute any pleural fluid which may be
 present.
