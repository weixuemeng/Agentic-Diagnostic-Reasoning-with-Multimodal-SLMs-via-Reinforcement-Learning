 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxic respiratory failure.  Evaluation of endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Initial portable AP chest radiographs demonstrate right main stem
 bronchus intubation with collapse of the left lung.  Subsequent images show
 the ET tube has been withdrawn and now terminates 5.3 cm above the carina with
 slightly improved aeration of the left lung.  There are still low lung volumes
 bilaterally with opacification of the left lung, possibly due to underlying
 infection or hemorrhage. A small left pleural effusion may be present.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
