                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polysubstance abuse, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Respiratory motion as well as scattered radiation related to the
 size of the patient, all contribute to limitation of the study.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube measures approximately 2.3 cm above the carina.  Right
 IJ catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  There is some asymmetric
 opacification on the left.  It is unclear whether this could reflect some
 asymmetric edema or possibly a region of consolidation.  A sharper repeat
 study could be helpful.
 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach with the side hole apparently distal
 to the esophagogastric junction.
