                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 7:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pelvic fracture, L1 burst fracture,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made with the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:35.
 
 AP portable chest film dated ___ at 7:13am is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Linear opacity at the left base likely reflects scar near subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Lungs otherwise are well inflated and remain without evidence of
 focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcification in aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  Persistent thoracolumbar curvature.  A
 hardware overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.  No pulmonary
 edema.
