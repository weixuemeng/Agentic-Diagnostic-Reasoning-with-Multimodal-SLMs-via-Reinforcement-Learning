                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:50 a.m.
 
 There is hyperinflation consistent with COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly, with  left ventricular configuration and a  calcified, slightly
 unfolded aorta. No CHF.  There is atelectasis at the right base, without focal
 consolidation.  There is some increased retrocardiac density, consistent with
 left lower lobe atelectasis, slightly more pronounced than on ___ -- the
 possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No gross
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD and cardiomegaly.
 2.  No CHF.
 3.  Atelectasis at both bases.  Findings at the left base are slightly worse
 compared with ___ and the possibility of an early infectious infiltrate in
 theleft lower lobe would be difficult to exclude.
