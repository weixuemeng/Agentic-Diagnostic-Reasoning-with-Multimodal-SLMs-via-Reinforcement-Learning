                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous, and there is calcification of the
 aortic knob.  The descending thoracic aorta appears enlarged as compared to
 prior radiographs, measuring 5 cm.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a
 small left-sided pleural effusion.  Increased opacification of the right base
 likely represents atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacification of the right base likely represents atelectasis,
 however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 
 2.  The descending thoracic aorta appears possibly enlarged as compared to
 prior radiographs, measuring 5 cm.
