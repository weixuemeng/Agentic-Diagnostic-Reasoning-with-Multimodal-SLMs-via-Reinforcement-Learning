                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  COPD, wheeze and cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study dating back ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Patient has known emphysema. 
 Increased interstitial opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally could
 represent interstitial edema, but atypical infection is in the differential. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Severe degenerative changes are
 in the thoracic spine.  
 There is widened mediastinum of unclear etiology.  CT is recommended after
 this acute process has resolved for further evaluation.
