 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded.  Projecting over the anterior aspect of the left
 sixth rib is either region of sclerosis in the costal cartilage, left nipple,
 or lung nodule.  In order to distinguish these, I recommend shallow oblique
 views with nipple markers.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  shallow oblique views with nipple markers.
