                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Medial,
 posterior right base opacity is worrisome for pneumonia.  The left lung is
 clear aside from minimal left base linear atelectasis/scarring.  No definite
 pleural effusion is seen, although a trace effusion would be difficult to
 exclude on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
