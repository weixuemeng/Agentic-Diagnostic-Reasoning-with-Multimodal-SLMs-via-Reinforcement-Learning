                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced compared to the previous exam. The heart
 size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result
 of low lung volumes. Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases. This is
 nonspecific, and could reflect areas of atelectasis, but aspiration or
 infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may be due to
 atelectasis, but aspiration or infection is not excluded.
