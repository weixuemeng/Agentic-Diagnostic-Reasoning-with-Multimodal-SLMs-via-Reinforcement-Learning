                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of left forearm fractures.  Please evaluate
 preoperatively.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidations
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures appear to be unremarkable; however, on the
 lateral view, the patient's arm is down, which limits evaluation of the
 retrocardiac space.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified.
