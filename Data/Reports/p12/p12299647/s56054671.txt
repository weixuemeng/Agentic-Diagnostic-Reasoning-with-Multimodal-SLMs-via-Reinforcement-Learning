 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ and CT of
 the chest dated ___

 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, and shifted leftward.  The
 right lung is hyperaerated expanded, unchanged since prior examination.  The
 right-sided chest port is noted, with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.  A round opacity in the left upper lung corresponds to a rounded
 nodule seen on recent chest CT.  Another, the smaller round opacity is noted
 in the right lower lung which does not have a definite correlate on recent CT
 scan.  There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  No definite
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is noted.
