                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Rule out CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The patient has a right-sided dialysis line in unchanged position. 
 Sternotomy wires are identified in an unusual position.  There is unchanged
 cardiomegaly.  Wedge-shaped opacification in the right lower lobe is unchanged
 as is pleural blunting and effusion in the left base.  There is only a tiny
 amount of increased peribronchial opacification when compared to the prior
 study.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Loculated fluid right base and chronic fluid in left base.
 
 There is probably a small amount of increased fluid over the prior radiograph.
 There is cardiomegaly and unusually orientated sternal wires probably
 reflecting sternal dehiscence.
