                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with altered mental status and desaturation. 
 From ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The very tip of the ET tube is visualized at the thoracic inlet. 
 The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Bibasilar consolidations are better visualized on the
 current CT torso. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate
 due to the AP lordotic projection, but the left heart border is straightened
 and the possibility of some leftward shoft cannot be excluded. The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.  No displaced fractures identified. (Please see
 other contemporaneous studies showing left humeral fracture, not directly
 imaged on this exam).
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip at the thoracic inlet and should be advanced.  
 2.  Nasogastric tube below the diaphragm in the stomach.  
 3.  Bibasilar consolidations are better visualized on the concurrent CT torso.
 
 4.  Cadriomediastinal silhouette, as described. ? slight volume loss on left.
