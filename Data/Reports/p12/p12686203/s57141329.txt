                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with left chest wall pain. Evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the neck from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Prominence of the right upper mediastinum is
 unchanged dating back to ___, thus likely benign. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise normal. No acute fracture is identified.  Mild
 compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine are unchanged from ___.
 Note, subtle nondisplaced fractures can be missed by chest radiography.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No evidence of a fracture. Although no acute
 fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs
 are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If
 the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is clinically warranted, the
 location where there are focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged
 with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
