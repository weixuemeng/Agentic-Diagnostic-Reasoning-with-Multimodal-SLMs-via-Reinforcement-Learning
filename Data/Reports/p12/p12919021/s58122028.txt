  cardiopulmonary abnormality.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  *** CODE CORD *** History: ___M with intubation*** WARNING ***
 Multiple patients with same last name!  // eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Film obtained without and penetrated technique, limiting assessment of fine
 detail.Lung volumes are slightly low.
 
 Allowing for this, an endotracheal tube ends the mid thoracic trachea,
 approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the level
 of the diaphragm to overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus.
 
 There is no focal consolidation.  Prominence of the right superior mediastinum
 is again seen.  Equivocal faint opacity at the right lung apex, unchanged
 compared with the previous film.  No supine film evidence pneumothorax is
 detected.  As before, there is prominence of the paraspinal lines, most
 notably  about the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube ends the mid thoracic trachea,, approximately 3.6 cm
 above the carina.  NG tube extends beneath diaphragm.
 
 Mild prominence of the superior mediastinum, similar to the chest radiograph
 obtained earlier the same day.
 
 Equivocal faint opacity at the right lung apex, unchanged.  The appearance is
 not typical for apical capping.
 
 Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 Prominence of paraspinal lines about the lower thoracic spine.  Please see
 torso CT obtained earlier the same day demonstrating multiple thoracic spine
 fractures.  The fractures themselves are not well depicted radiographically.
