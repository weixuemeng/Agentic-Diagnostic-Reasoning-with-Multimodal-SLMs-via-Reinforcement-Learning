                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trauma  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:03
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads.  The carina is
 not well delineated, but the tip of the ET tube likely lies approximately 4.7
 cm above the carina.  An NG type tube is present, tip overlying the stomach. 
 No NG sideport is identified.  If present, the NG tube sideport may be
 obscured by a spine hardware.  If so, it lies in the region of the GE
 junction, probably slightly proximal to the GE junction.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  There has been slight interval improvement in degree of
 retrocardiac opacity, consistent with interval improvement in left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation is noted.  New no new focal opacity or area of
 consolidation is identified.  No gross right or left pleural effusion is seen.
 Small effusions could still be present.  Mild vascular plethora likely relates
 to supine positioning.  Doubt overt CHF.  Spinal fixation hardware noted.  An
 ovoid locule of air in the right cardiophrenic region is unchanged compared
 with the preoperative chest x-ray from ___ this likely represents
 artifact due to suture material from prior lung surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in the degree of retrocardiac opacity.  No new
 infiltrate or consolidation.  No pneumothorax or gross effusion.  Doubt overt
 CHF.
 
 NG tube tip overlies the stomach.  Please see comment regarding possible
 sideport location.
