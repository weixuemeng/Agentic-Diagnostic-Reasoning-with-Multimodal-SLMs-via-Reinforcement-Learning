                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Incidentally noted left lung consolidation on CTA neck.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA head and neck ___, chest radiograph ___ (comparison to report only as the PACS fetching system was not working at
 the time of interpretation).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm precludes
 evaluation of the cardiac contour and inferior left hilar contour.  Per prior
 report this was present in ___.  Plate-like atelectasis is noted at the
 left lung base.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, secondary to
 known paralysis by prior report, with associated plate-like atelectasis.
