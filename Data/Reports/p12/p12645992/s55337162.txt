                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, chest pain s/p fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.   Dual lead pacemaker is
 unchanged in position with leads extending to the region of the right atrium
 and right ventricle. Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, right greater
 than left. Associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis is likely also
 present. A retrocardiac density containing an air-fluid level likely
 represents a hiatal hernia. Coarsened curvilinear structures projecting over
 the heart likely represent mitral annular calcification. No pneumothorax is
 seen. Pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the lower lungs given effusions and
 subjacent consolidation. No acute bony abnormality is seen. DISH related
 changes of the thoracic spine with chronic appearing deformity of the right
 humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated
 compressive lower lobe atelectasis, cannot exclude pneumonia.
