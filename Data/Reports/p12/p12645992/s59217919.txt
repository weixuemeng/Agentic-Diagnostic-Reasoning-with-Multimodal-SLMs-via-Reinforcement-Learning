                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after placement of a right pigtail
 catheter for pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There has been almost complete resolution of right pleural effusion with a
 pigtail catheter placed in the right base.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate left pleural effusion is again noted.  Pacemaker leads are in
 standard position.  Cardiomegaly cannot be evaluated.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
