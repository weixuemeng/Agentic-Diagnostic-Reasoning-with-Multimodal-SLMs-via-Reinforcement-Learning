                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. 
 This may reflect pleural effusion with atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely represents pleural effusion and atelectasis but
 left lower lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting cannot be
 excluded.
