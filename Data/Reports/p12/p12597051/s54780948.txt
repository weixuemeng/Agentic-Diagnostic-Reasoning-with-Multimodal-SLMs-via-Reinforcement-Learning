                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress and hypotension  // ?
 pulmonary edema, effusions, infiltrate      ? pulmonary edema, effusions,
 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 12:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 07:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Spinal hardware remains in place. The left subclavian PICC line continues to
 terminate in the proximal right atrium.  The right PICC line has been removed.
 Persistent airspace consolidation in both upper lobes, the medial right base
 and the left base are essentially unchanged and may reflect an infectious
 process although pulmonary edema should also be considered. Clinical
 correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse airspace
 process.
