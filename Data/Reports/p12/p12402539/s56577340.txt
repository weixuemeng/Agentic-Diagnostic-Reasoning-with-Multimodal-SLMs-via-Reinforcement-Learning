  ETT is 1.7 cm above the carina and could be pulled back about 2 cm for more
  standard positioning.  The right IJ terminates in the low SVC, near the
  cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.  No change in the extensive bilateral
  diffuse airspace opacities and layering pleural effusions.

 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube is about 1.7 cm above the carina.  It could be pulled back
 about 2 cm for more standard positioning.  Otherwise, little interval change
 in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications and position of the right IJ
 catheter.
