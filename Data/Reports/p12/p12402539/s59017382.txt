 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ from ___ and
 ___; CT ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes
 results in bronchovascular crowding.   A right internal jugular catheter ends
 in the region of the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities,
 with bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right,
 and atelectasis have significantly increased from ___.  The upper
 lung zones are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Evaluation of the heart is
 difficult to bilateral opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: New bilateral pleural effusions, left larger than right, with
 adjacent atelectasis.
