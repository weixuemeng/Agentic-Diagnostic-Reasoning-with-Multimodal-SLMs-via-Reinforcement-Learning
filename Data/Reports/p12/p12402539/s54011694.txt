                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The ET tube is folded over.  Allowing for this, the ET tube tip appears to lie
 at the level of the mid-clavicles, similar to the earlier film from ___ at
 4:06 a.m., approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip
 beneath diaphragm, overlying stomach. A right IJ central line tip overlies the
 SVC/RA junction, unchanged.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but grossly unchanged and
 likely accentuated by technique.
 
 There are diffuse bilateral opacities, with obscuration of both hemidiaphragms
 and evidence of air bronchograms on both sides.  Compared with the prior film,
 there may be some increased opacity in the right upper zone laterally. 
 Otherwise, I doubt gross change.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities, with slight interval worsening in the right upper
 zone laterally.  Although nonspecific, the appearance is compatible with
 pulmonary edema, with bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  However, the differential diagnosis includes pneumonic
 infiltrates.
