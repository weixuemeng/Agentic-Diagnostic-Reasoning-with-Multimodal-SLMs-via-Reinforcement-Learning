                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left chest wall axillary pain, now status post left axillary wall
 debridement.  Assess PICC line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the right-sided central venous
 catheter with repositioning of the right-sided PICC line, which now terminates
 in the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax identified.  There has been interval
 improvement in the bibasilar opacifications thought to represent a combination
 of atelectasis and pneumonia with overall improved aeration of the upper
 lungs.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No osseous
 abnormality is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line terminating in distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  Improving pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
