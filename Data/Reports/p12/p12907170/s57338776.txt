 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for line placement and evaluation for mediastinal
 structures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:19 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  The lateral radiograph shows a tubular device
 overlying the thorax from outside.
 
 The mediastinum is less wide and more transparent than on the previous
 examination.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  There is unchanged evidence of
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Fluid markings of the pleural space and
 small bilateral dorsal pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
