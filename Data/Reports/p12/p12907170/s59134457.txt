 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:24 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube terminates appropriately above the carina. 
 The left internal jugular vein catheter is malpositioned.  The catheter needs
 to be re-positioned.  The new right subclavian line terminates in the right
 atrium.  The line should be pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm.  Interval
 worsening of the pulmonary edema and the pre-existing areas of basal
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  The presence of small pleural effusions cannot
 be excluded.
