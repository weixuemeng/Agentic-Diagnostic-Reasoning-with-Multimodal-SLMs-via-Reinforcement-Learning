                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line is in place.  There is gradual increase in the
 right mediastinum, with the distention and currently the distance between the
 lateral border of the right mediastinum and carina at the level of the azygos
 vein being 4.5 cm as compared to 2 cm back on ___.  Differential
 diagnosis might include potential extravasation and hematoma due to the
 presence of the subclavian line versus distention due to increased volume
 overload (likely).  Patient continues to be in interstitial pulmonary edema.
 Left pleural effusion is most likely present as well as the right, moderate.
 Unchanged appearance of the monitoring devices is present with the ET tube tip
 being approximately 4 cm above the carina.
