 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shock, device placement.

 the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  The right and left
 central venous access lines are constant in appearance.
 
 Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 
 The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
