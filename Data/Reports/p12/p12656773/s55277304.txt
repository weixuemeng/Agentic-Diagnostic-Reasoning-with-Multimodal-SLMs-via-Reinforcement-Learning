                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD/asthma.  Evaluate evolution of left
 lower lobe opacity.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been slight decrease in conspicuity of the
 left lower lobe opacity.  The lungs are otherwise clear, heart size is stable,
 and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval decrease in conspicuity of the left lower lobe opacity, which
 may reflect resolving atelectasis or response of focal pneumonia to therapy
 (if receiving antibiotics).
