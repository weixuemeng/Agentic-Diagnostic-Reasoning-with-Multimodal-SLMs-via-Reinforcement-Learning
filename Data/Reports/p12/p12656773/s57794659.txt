 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly is likely due to pleural
 thickening.  Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are present.
