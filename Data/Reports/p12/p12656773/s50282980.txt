                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and black sputum, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is equivocal minimal interstitial edema.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal
 to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Partially imaged is what appears to be a possible degenerative change at the
 right humeral head, although not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation seen.  Possible minimal interstitial edema.
 2.  Partially imaged irregularity at the right humeral head may reflect
 degenerative change or prior trauma.
