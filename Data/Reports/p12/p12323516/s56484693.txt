 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with slight interval improvement of widespread pulmonary opacification, most
 notable in the right lung.  Persistent opacification of the left lower lung
 represents a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  ET tube is 3 cm above the carina.  Right-sided
 central venous line ends in the distal SVC.  Nasogastric tube is in the
 stomach and off the image.  No pneumothorax.
