                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and productive cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are clear
 of focal consolidation.  There is some blunting of the left posterior
 costophrenic angle, which could be due to atelectasis or small effusion versus
 small Bochdalek hernia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits
 given significant rotation to the right.  Degenerative changes noted at the
 acromioclavicular joints bilaterally.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Blunting of the left
 posterior costophrenic angle, potentially due to atelectasis or Bochdalek
 hernia, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be completely excluded. 
 Please clinically correlate.
