                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate right PICC line in
 place with tip in the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or other complication
 seen.  There is some decreased lung volume, likely due to poor inspiration. 
 The lungs are grossly unchanged from previous examination.  There is some
 blunting of the costophrenic angles which could possibly be due to atelectasis
 or small pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC line in place with tip in the low SVC.  Otherwise,
 unchanged chest radiographs.
