                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough for 1 week, history of lung cancer. Right
 total pneumonectomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post right total pneumonectomy with expected postoperative
 changes including rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip appears to terminate in the low SVC.  Heart size is difficult
 to assess given the prior pneumonectomy, but the cardiac and mediastinal
 contours appear unchanged.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated within the left
 lung base.  No left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Small
 hiatal hernia is again visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right pneumonectomy.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base may
 reflect pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
