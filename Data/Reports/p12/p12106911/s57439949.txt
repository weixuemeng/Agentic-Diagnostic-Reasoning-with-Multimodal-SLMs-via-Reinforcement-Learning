                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the amount of fluid in the right
 pleural space is probably increasing and the degree of air is decreasing. 
 Isolated air-fluid levels are again seen consistent with areas of loculation. 
 The left lung remains essentially clear, and there is no appreciable pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  
 
 Extensive subcutaneous gas is again seen along the right lateral chest wall
 extending into the neck.  This has not appreciably improved since the previous
 study.
