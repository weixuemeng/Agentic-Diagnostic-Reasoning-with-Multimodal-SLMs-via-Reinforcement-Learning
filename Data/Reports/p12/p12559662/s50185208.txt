 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:41 PM
  Vague right upper and left lower lung opacities, question infectious or
  inflammatory process of lower airways; asymmetric congestion could be
  considered, perhaps less likely.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Mild unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta appears similar.  There are new patchy opacities in the
 left lower lung, probably within the lingula and vague streaky right upper
 lung opacities.  These could be seen in association with lower airway
 infection or inflammation.  It is also difficult to exclude bronchopneumonia. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are
 similar along the thoracic spine.  Slight subpleural thickening at each lung
 apex is also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacities in the right upper and left lower lungs, which
 potentially are due to an infectious etiology or possibly inflammation of
 airways.  An atypical pattern of mild pulmonary congestion would be a lesser
 differential consideration based on the distribution but could be considered.
