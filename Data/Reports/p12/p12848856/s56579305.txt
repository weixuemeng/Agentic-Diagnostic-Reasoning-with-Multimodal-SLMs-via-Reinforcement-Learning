                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anemia and tachypnea.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is chronic opacity at the right base.  Opacities at the left
 base are also similar and may reflect atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax on
 this single frontal projection.  Slight prominence of interstitial markings
 may reflect mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Chronic bibasilar opacities.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
