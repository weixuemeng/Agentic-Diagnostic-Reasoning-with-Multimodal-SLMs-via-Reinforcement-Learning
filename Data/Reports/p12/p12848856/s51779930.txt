                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  EKG changes, positive troponins.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There are bibasilar opacities which silhouette
 the hemidiaphragms.  There is engorgement of the central pulmonary
 vasculature.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but stable compared to
 prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, with associated opacities which are
 particularly extensive in the right lower lobe, not specific but which could
 be seen with atelectasis associated with effusions.  However, if there is
 persistent clinical concern for pneumonia, the possibility if not excluded and
 short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered if symptoms were to
 persist.  Vascular engorgement suggestive of congestive failure.
