                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR and CABG.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The film is underpenetrated, limiting assessment of lines overlying the
 mediastinum.  There is a line that does overlie the mediastinum -- ? ET or NG
 tube, not fully evaluated on this examination.  A right-sided chest tube is
 present.  The patient is status post sternotomy.  
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF. 
 There are small bilateral effusions with underlying bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Compared with ___, there is probable slight interval worsening of left
 base opacity with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Otherwise, no
 significant change. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette, mild CHF, and bibasilar
 collapse/consolidation and effusions.
 2.  Line overlying upper mediastinum not fully evaluated due to
 underpenetration.  If clinically indicated, repeat view can be obtained at no
 additional charge to the patient.  This line is new compared with ___ at
 13:39 p.m.
