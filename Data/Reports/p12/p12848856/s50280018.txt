 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 mediastinal drain.  Bilateral chest tubes are still in place.  No pneumothorax
 evident.  Stable bibasilar consolidations likely representing a combination of
 moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left.  Right-sided central venous catheter again noted with tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
