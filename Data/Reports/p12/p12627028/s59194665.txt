 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates very low lung

 the bilateral bases, left greater than right, and in the setting of very low
 lung volumes, may represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or a combination.  Heart
 size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacities are seen at the bilateral bases, left greater than
 right, and in the setting of very low lung volumes, may represent atelectasis,
