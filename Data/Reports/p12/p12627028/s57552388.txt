                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 This examination was focused in the thoracoabdominal region.  NG tube in one
 film is in the mid chest and in a second film, the NG tube tip is at the level
 of the hemidiaphragm, should be repositioned for standard placement. 
 Evaluation of the lungs is limited due to the projection.  There are
 persistent bibasilar opacities and cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar opacities are
 consistent with atelectasis.  The stomach is very distended.  Partially
 imaged, there are distended small bowel loops.
