                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  COPD and scoliosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two AP portable views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are patchy basilar opacities,
 increased at the right lung base and similar at the left lung base including
 blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus, although there is no definite
 demonstration of a pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased patchy right basilar opacity, although fairly typical of
 atelectasis with no other significant change.
