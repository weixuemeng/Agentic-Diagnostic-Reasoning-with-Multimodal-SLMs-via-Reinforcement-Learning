                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:12 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and respiratory distress, question
 fluid overload, question pulmonary edema, effusion or infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:55.
 
 A single AP upright chest film ___ at 5:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient
 rotation on the current examination.  Lung volumes have diminished and there
 is patchy opacity noted at the right base which is more confluent as well as
 linear opacity at the left base.  These findings may reflect bibasilar
 atelectasis and/or post-inflammatory scarring.  However, given the focality of
 the finding on the right side, this would be concerning for aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Pulmonary vasculature is somewhat prominent, but there is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is a healing right posterolateral rib fracture with
 some callus formation which was not previously seen.  No pneumothorax.  No
 pleural effusions.
