                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:04 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement and assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:19.
 
 Single portable AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 6:04, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet, unchanged. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal
 brachiocephalic vein near the junction with the superior vena cava.
 2.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient
 rotation on the current examination.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Probable bibasilar opacities with possible associated pleural effusions
 favoring bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No obvious pneumothorax is seen.
