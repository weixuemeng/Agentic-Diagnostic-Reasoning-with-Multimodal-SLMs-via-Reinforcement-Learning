                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a shifting pattern of opacification at the right
 lung base with an overall increase, while a left basilar opacity has mostly
 cleared.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A healed
 right posterolateral seventh rib fracture appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lower lobe with shifting distribution suggestive
 of atelectasis, but given increase in vague opacity, developing pneumonia is a
 consideration.
