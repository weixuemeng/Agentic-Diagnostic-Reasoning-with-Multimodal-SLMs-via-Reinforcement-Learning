                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question extent of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier study on the same day as well as radiographs and chest
 ultrasound from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There are patchy basilar opacities with similar distribution which suggests
 atelectasis associated with low lung volumes.  The lateral view suggests
 patchy posterior left lower lobe opacity and flattening of hemidiaphragms. 
 Although it is difficult to exclude that a posterior opacity may represent an
 effusion, it probably represents atelectasis.  An ultrasound from the prior
 day showed no evidence for fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities, not specific but suggestive of atelectasis. 
 If pneumonia is a clinical concern, then a short-term followup radiographs,
 preferably with standard PA and lateral technique, could be considered.  If
 there is clinical concern that a pleural effusion may have developed since the
 ultrasound, then potentially a decubitus view might be useful if clinically
 indicated.
