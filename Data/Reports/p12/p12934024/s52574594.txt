                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible right PICC repositioning, here to evaluate PICC
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC is similar in configuration with the tip terminating
 in the proximal right atrium, which should be retracted 2.5-3 cm to place in
 the low SVC.  The course of the line is unremarkable.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is exaggerated due to AP technique and low lung
 volumes, but likely remains within normal limits and stable.  There is partial
 calcification of the aortic knob.  A healed right posterior rib fracture is
 redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC with tip in the proximal right atrium should be
 retracted 2.5-3 cm to place in low SVC.  Otherwise, stable appearance of the
 chest from ___.
