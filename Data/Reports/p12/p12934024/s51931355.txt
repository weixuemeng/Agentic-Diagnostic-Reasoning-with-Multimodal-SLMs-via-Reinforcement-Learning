                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar
 opacifications are consistent with substantial pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Pulmonary vascularity appears to be essentially within normal limits.
