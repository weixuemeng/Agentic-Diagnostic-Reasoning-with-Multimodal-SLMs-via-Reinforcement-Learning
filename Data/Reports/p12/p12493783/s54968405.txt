                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right shoulder pain, smoker, rule
 out Pancoast tumor.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened but without local contour
 abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  There is some mild degree of degenerative changes mostly
 involving the mid portion of the thoracic spine in the form of osteophytic
 prominences at the vertebral body edges but no vertebral body destruction is
 seen.  With regard to the patient's right shoulder pain, the skeletal
 structures of clavicle and scapula are rather unremarkable.  No local rib
 abnormalities are identified and there is no suspicion for any pulmonary or
 pleural abnormality in this region.  Should patient's symptoms persist,
 evaluation of shoulder area with either dedicated skeletal exposures or MRI is
 recommended.  
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary or pleural abnormalities in this patient
 with history of right-sided shoulder discomfort.
