                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 pulmonary pathology.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size appears to be at the upper limit of normal
 variation; however, precise heart size is difficult to assess because of
 surrounding extracardiac fat pads.  Significant cardiac enlargement is
 unlikely as there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Thoracic aorta only
 mildly widened and elongated in this ___-year-old female patient.  No evidence
 of acute pulmonary infiltrates and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  On the lateral view, one can
 identify a very mild blunting of the posterior pleural sinuses, finding which
 was not present on the next previous study of ___.  It may express a mild
 chronic CHF and pleural effusion.  No other acute pulmonary or cardiovascular
 abnormalities are seen.
