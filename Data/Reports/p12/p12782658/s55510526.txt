                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, fever, altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The chin overlies the right apex and upper mediastinum significantly
 limiting evaluation.  Lung volumes are low.  Yhe right hemidiaphragm is poorly
 visualized due to right basilar opacities, likely a combination of atelectasis
 and small pleural effusion.  Atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base. 
 The cardiac silhouette is poorly visualized and evaluated due to the low lung
 volumes.  The mediastinum is not significantly changed since the next most
 recent radiograph.  There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature without evidence of frank pulmonary edema.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcified.  There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation; Bibasilar atelectasis and possible small right
 pleural effusion, underlying infection cannot be excluded.   Mild prominence
 of the central pulmonary vasculature without evidence of frank pulmonary
 edema.
