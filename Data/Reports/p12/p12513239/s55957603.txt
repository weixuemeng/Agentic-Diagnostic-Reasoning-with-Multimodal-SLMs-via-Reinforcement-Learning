                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST FILM FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia status post NG tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film from ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian central line with its tip in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. 
 Overall, there has been significant improvement in the bilateral diffuse
 airspace process.  Given the interval change, this would favor that improving
 pulmonary edema rather than an acute infectious process, but clinical
 correlation would be advised.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
