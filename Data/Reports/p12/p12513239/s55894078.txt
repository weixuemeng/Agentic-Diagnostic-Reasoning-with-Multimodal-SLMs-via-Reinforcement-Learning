                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HIV, now with altered mental status, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 17:25 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian approach central venous catheter is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes remain relatively low but there is improved aeration
 of the right upper lung zone.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral opacities in the upper lung zones with perihilar distribution are
 concerning for multifocal infection given the patient's clinical history. 
 Subtle opacities at the right lung base, greater than the left, may reflect
 underaeration or atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size
 but stable.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved right upper lung aeration but persistent bilateral
 perihilar opacities worrisome for multifocal infectious process including PCP.
