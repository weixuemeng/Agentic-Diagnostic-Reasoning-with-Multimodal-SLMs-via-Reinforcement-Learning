                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Right
 hemidiaphragm appears less distinct than on the prior study and is associated
 with a subtle area of increased opacification at the right lung base.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces, but
 evaluation of the left apex is limited due to obscuration of overlying
 structures of the chin and neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible early/developing right lower lobe pneumonia.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful.
