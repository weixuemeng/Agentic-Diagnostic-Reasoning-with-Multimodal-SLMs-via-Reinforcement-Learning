                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia, fever, postop day 3.  Question acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 Again seen is minimal atelectasis at the right base, with an elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  The opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle has improved
 compared with ___.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Minimal retrocardiac opacity is similar to the prior film.  No CHF or gross
 effusion.  Upper and mid zones remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases.  Interval clearing right
 costophrenic angle.
