                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent nausea and vomiting, status post NG tube removal, postop
 day 3 status post open gastric wedge resection and lysis of adhesions. 
 Question position of NGT, acute intrathoracic process.  Evaluate previous
 right lower lobe opacity.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 10:09 a.m.
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip overlies the stomach.  A sideport, if present,
 is not well visualized.  Additional tubing appears to represent the proximal
 portion of the NG tube outside the patient.  Compared to the prior film, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Linear atelectasis and/or
 scarring at the right base is unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 similar to prior, without overt CHF.  Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac
 region.  No frank consolidation and no effusion identified.  No free air is
 seen beneath the diaphragm.  
 
 Aside from the linear atelectasis or scarring at the right base, no focal
 opacity related to the right lower lobe is appreciated on this frontal view.
