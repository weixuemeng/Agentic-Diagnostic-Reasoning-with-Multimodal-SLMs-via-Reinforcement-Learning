 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ mylodysplastic syndrome POD #3 from subtotal
 gastrectomy  // ? PNA, cause for fever
 
 COMPARISON:   chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is new atelectasis and a very small new
 right pleural effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, perhaps slightly
 more than on the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar,
 allowing for differences in positioning and technique. No CHF, frank
 consolidation, or left-sided effusion is identified. No pneumothorax and no
 free air beneath the diaphragm is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
