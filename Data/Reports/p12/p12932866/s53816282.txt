                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable
 with atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch again noted.  A fudicial
 seed is again seen within a posterior left lower lobe lesion, compatible with
 known malignancy status post CyberKnife therapy.  Minimal streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis, though infection is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Multiple clips
 are again seen within the upper abdomen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe lesion containing a fudicial marker, not significantly changed
 from the prior study.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude.
