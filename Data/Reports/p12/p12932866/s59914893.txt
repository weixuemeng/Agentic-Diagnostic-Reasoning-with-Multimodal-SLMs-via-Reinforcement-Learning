                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Epigastric pain at base of ribs, patient has known HCC and
 non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Left lower lobe opacities with a marker and lung
 nodules are better seen in prior CT.  Patient has known emphysema.  There is
 no pneumothorax.   
 
 There is no evidence of displaced rib fractures, but this examination is not
 tailored to evaluate the osseous structures, and if clinically concerned,
 dedicated rib series can be performed.  Dense material projecting in the right
 upper quadrant (liver) reflects prior TACE.
 
 A small left pleural effusion is stable.
