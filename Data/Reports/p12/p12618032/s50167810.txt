                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fevers, bibasilar rhonchi, evaluate for
 opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable reflective of a tortuous thoracic
 aorta.  There is no cardiomegaly.  The bilateral hila are within normal
 limits.  There are low lung volumes and crowding of normal bronchovascular
 structures.  There is peribronchial cuffing most notable in the lower lobes. 
 There is no focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  A radiographic interstitial abnormality is noted, unlikely
 to be interstitial pneumonia due to widespread appearance.  This most likely
 represents mild pulmonary edema.
