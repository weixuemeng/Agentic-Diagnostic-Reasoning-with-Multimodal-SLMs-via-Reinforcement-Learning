                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass grafting.  Evaluate for infiltrate and
 effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Patchy opacity in the
 right lower lobe is new, but preexisting atelectasis in this lobe has partly
 cleared.  Linear opacities in the left lobe most likely represent atelectasis.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 from prior CABG.  No pneumothorax identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy right lower lobe opacity concerning for acute
 aspiration. Short term follow up radiograph may be useful to exclude a
 developing infectious pneumonia in this region.  Linear opacities in the left
 lung most likely represent atelectasis.
