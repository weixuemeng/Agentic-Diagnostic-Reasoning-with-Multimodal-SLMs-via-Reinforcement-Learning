                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated which exaggerates the size of the
 mediastinum significantly.  A right-sided PICC line terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The aorta is tortuous and unfolded.  Cardiac size is top
 normal.  Left lower lobe opacities are relatively stable over the prior few
 studies.  Comparison made to the ___ CT demonstrates atelectasis,
 effusion and additional consolidations in this area worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Right-sided basal atelectasis is also present.  The upper lungs are clear. 
 There is no free air.  
 
 Severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint as well as
 left-sided shoulder replacement are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacities, previously seen on a CT from ___ are likely a combination of effusion, atelectasis as well as pneumonia.
