                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post Whipple surgery, now with
 postoperative ileus.  Assess nasogastric catheter position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___ (preoperative),
 most recent from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement of a
 nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the proximal stomach.  A right approach
 central venous line is in unchanged standard position.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions. 
 Upper lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged and slightly exaggerated due to the AP technique of the
 film.  A left humeral head prosthesis is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the
 stomach.  No other significant change compared to recent prior.
