                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polytrauma with lower sats, post-bronchoscopy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is a
 tracheostomy tube in place.  External artifacts make it impossible to
 adequately evaluate the mid portion of the image.  There is some increasing
 opacification at the right base.  It is unclear whether this could reflect
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis or possibly a developing
 consolidation.
 
 The medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, raising the
 possibility of volume loss in the left lower lobe.
