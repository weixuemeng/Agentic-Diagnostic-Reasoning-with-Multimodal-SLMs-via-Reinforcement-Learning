 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased oxygen requirements, pancreatitis, evaluation.

 however, are still moderate in extent.  Unchanged bilateral basal areas of
 atelectasis.  Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices.  In
 the well-ventilated lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of pneumonia or
 other acute parenchymal process.
