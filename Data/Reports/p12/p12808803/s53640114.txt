                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pancreatitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two upright images of the chest demonstrate mild bilateral
 pulmonary vascular congestion, unchanged from previous imaging.  There is a
 small new opacity at the left lung base which likely represents atelectasis. 
 Small right pleural effusion is again seen.  Left pleural effusion has mostly
 resolved.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Support and maintenance
 devices are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in left pleural effusion and interval increase
 in left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, essentially unchanged chest
 radiograph.
