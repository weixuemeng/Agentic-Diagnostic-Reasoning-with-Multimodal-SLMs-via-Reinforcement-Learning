                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, status post Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:21 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, although the carina
 is not well seen on this study.  The right subclavian line ends in the mid
 SVC, and the right PICC ends in the lower SVC.  The new Dobbhoff tube ends
 with the tip just beyond the diaphragm in the proximal stomach. Otherwise,
 pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged with bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube ends just below the diaphragm in the stomach and
 could be advanced for better seating.
