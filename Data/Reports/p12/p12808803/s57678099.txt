 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:20 PM
  Interval advancing of the Dobhoff catheter which follows the expected course
  of the duodenum, with tip projecting in the expected location of the distal
  duodenum; although thought to be less likely, coiling in the stomach or other
  placement cannot be excluded on this single view. If needed, confirmation with
  injection of a small amount of contrast could help to confirm tip location.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New Dobbhoff catheter, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has obviously
 received a new Dobbhoff catheter.  The course of the catheter is unremarkable,
 the position of the tip is not documented on the image.  Unchanged presence of
 a left pleural pigtail catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Unchanged size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  The endotracheal tube is also unchanged.
