 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after exploratory
 laparotomy 22 days ago, currently with recently treated pneumonia and chest
 pain.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip not currently seen,
 potentially in the stomach.  The tracheostomy is in place.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are noted, grossly unchanged.  No interval
 development of process in the lungs is demonstrated, but increase in the
 pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
