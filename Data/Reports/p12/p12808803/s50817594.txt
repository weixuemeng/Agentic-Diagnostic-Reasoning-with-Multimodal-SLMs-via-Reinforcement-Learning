                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of respiratory failure with left pigtail catheter for
 pleural effusion drainage.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.  CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam performed one day prior, the patient has been
 extubated.  There has been interval development of mild pulmonary edema. 
 Increased opacification in the left lower lung zone could be due to asymmetric
 edema, although early pneumonia is a consideration.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The left pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A Dobbhoff tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the majority of the catheter out of the field of
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. New mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Left lower lobe opacification could be due to asymmetric edema or early
 pneumonia.
