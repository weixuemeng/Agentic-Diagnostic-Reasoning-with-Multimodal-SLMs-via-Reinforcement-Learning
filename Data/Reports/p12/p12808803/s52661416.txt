                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 Dobbhoff tube that straddles the esophagogastric junction.  It should be

 Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Suggestion of some poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm that could represent some atelectatic
 changes or even small effusion.
