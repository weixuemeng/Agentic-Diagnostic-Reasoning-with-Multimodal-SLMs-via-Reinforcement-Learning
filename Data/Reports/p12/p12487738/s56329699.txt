                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated  // interval change      interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison ___ at 16 33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 04:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are
 slightly lower and there is increasing opacity at the right medial lung base
 and in the retrocardiac area.  Although this may represent atelectasis,
 pneumonia should also be considered.  There is likely a layering left
 effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen,
 although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.
