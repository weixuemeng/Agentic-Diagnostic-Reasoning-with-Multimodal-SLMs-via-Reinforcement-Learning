                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with tachybrady syndrome, status post
 pacemaker placement and AV junction ablation.  Confirm lead position and
 evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 semi-upright position using AP frontal and left lateral view.  Mild cardiac
 enlargement is probably present.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 seen.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and demonstrates
 calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  A permanent
 pacer appears in left anterior axillary position being connected to one
 intracavitary electrode seen to terminate in the apical portion of the right
 ventricle pointing anteriorly.  A sizable hiatal hernia with typical air-fluid
 level is noted in retrocardiac position.  There appear two linear densities on
 the right base likely representing peripheral plate atelectasis.  The lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free, and there is no pneumothorax on either
 side of the thorax in the apical area.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable single electrode pacer, no evidence of pneumothorax,
 right-sided basal peripheral plate atelectasis but no acute infiltrates and no
 pleural effusion.
