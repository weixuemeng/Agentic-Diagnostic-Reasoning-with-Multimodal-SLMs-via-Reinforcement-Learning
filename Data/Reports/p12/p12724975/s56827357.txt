                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male presenting hypotensive after MVC car versus
 tree.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest performed on the same date dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 This study is read in conjunction with chest CT performed subsequently after
 the insertion of thoracostomy tubes.
 
 Lateral aspect of the left hemi thorax is not included on this examination. 
 There is no pleural effusion or large pneumothorax along the imaged pleural
 surfaces.   Extensive dependent consolidation in both lungs is much more
 obvious on the chest CT which also showed right pneumothorax, which might have
 been due to subsequent thoracostomy drainage.  .  Moderate enlarged of the
 cardiac silhouette is due to cardiomegaly, not pericardial effusion or
 hemopericardium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral parenchymal contusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  See the subsequent chest CT and report for fuller
 diagnosis.
