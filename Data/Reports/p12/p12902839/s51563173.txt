                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation prior to neurosurgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  No focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 detected.  There is faint increased opacity in the medial left lung apex
 compared to the right.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is
 no evidence of pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Note is made of a
 healed but non-united fracture of the distal end of the right clavicle, which
 is unchanged from prior examinations.  There is no evidence of bridging callus
 across the fracture line.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Faint opacity in the left lung apex. Attention on followup is recommended.
 3.  Chronic non-united fracture of the distal right clavicle.
