                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sepsis possibly related to septic joint
 or cellulitis though with persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy
 (penicillin).  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___ and chest CT from ___.  
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right approach PICC terminates in
 the upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Lung volumes
 are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is stable enlargement of
 the central pulmonary vasculature, which suggests pulmonary hypertension.  A
 patchy opacity within the left mid lung is post-surgical.  However, the
 lateral view shows increased density over the lower thoracic spine which could
 reflect a developing lower lobe pneumonia, most likely right-sided.  Follow-up
 radiographs are recommended for further assessment.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Possible early basilar pneumonia.  Short term follow-up radiographs are
 recommended if warranted clinically.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___ at 4:04 pm
 on ___ by telephone.
