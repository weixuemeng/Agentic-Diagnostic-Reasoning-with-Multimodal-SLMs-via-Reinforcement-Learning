                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hemetemesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 right-sided PICC is again seen, terminating in the upper SVC.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged with a somewhat globular configuration and there
 may be underlying pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.  Left mid lung
 opacity is again seen, which may be post-surgical.  There is obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm which may in part be due to overlying soft tissue;
 however, left base consolidation or atelectasis may be present.  Dedicated PA
 and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.  The aorta remains
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may in part relate to
 overlying soft tissue; however, underlying consolidation and/or atelectasis
 may be present.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further
 evaluation.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, likely stable, but with a
 somewhat globular configuration now, underlying pericardial effusion or
 cardiomyopathy may be present.
