 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, worsening hypoxia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, indicative of interstitial
 lung edema have minimally improved, as documented by the lymphatic drain into
 small pleural effusions.  Relatively widespread signs of interstitial lung
 edema, however, are still visible.  This also includes borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No additional parenchymal opacities or changes.
