                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia and lethargy with recent vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contour is within normal limits.  There are mild increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally and diffusely, findings which could reflect
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, though an atypical infectious process is
 not excluded.  No large pleural effusion, focal consolidations or pneumothorax
 is present.  There are no acute osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally, which could
 be due to mild pulmonary vascular engorgement or an atypical infectious
 process and clinical correlation is recommended.
