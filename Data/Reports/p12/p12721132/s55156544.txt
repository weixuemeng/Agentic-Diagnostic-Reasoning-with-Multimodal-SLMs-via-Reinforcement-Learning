 COMPARISON:  ___, radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and
 accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  A
 more confluent area of airspace opacity in the right infrahilar region could
 reflect dependent pulmonary edema or other process such as aspiration or
 developing infectious pneumonia.  Bilateral hilar and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy are in keeping with known diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
