                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette demonstrates left ventricular configuration, and
 the aorta is diffusely tortuous.  Mediastinal and bilateral hilar
 lymphadenopathy are in keeping with diagnosis of sarcoid.  Recently described
 interstitial edema has resolved.  Right infrahilar opacity has slightly
 improved, and appears to localize primarily to the right middle lobe on the
 lateral radiograph.  Additional patchy right lower lobe opacity is present,
 partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm on both PA and lateral views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Slight improvement in right infrahilar opacity, which could be due to
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
