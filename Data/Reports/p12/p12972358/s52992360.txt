                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with clinical concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted,
 chronic per Dr. ___.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits, although evaluation of the right heart border is suboptimal in the
 setting of elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Linear density projecting over the
 right mid lung likely represents a focus of atelectasis or scarring.  A left
 subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the expected location of the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 9 p.m. on ___.
