                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old homeless man with productive cough, rattling breath
 sounds, ___ on RA  // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is bilateral diffuse reticular interstitial thickening, without prior
 imaging for comparison.  The right hila appears prominent.  Heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening, which could represent viral,
 atypical bacterial, or less likely fungal pneumonia.  This could also
 represent interstitial pulmonary edema, although there are no other findings
 to suggest congestive heart failure.
 2. Prominence of right hilum, which suggests pulmonary hypertension.
