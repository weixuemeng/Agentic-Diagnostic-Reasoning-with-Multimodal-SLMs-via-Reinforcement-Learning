                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large multiloculated right-sided and small leftsided layering
 pleural effusions are stable.  On a background of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right, likely
 represent combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion though superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
