                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with T101.1, history pancreatic cancer, mild
 epigastric tenderness to palpation, undergoing workup for sepsis  // eval ?
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted within the aortic knob.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity
 in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis with similar blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion or
 pleural thickening.  Left lung is clear.  Scarring within the lung apices is
 re- demonstrated.  An inferior vena cava filter is noted within the upper
 abdomen, just to the right of midline.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study.  Persistent patchy right
 basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, with unchanged blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle possibly due to a small pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening.
