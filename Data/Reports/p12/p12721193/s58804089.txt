                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously almost
 completely resolved right pleural effusion reoccurred.  The effusion occupies
 approximatively one-quarter of the right hemithorax.  The pleural drain on the
 right has been removed in the interval.  On the left, no pleural effusion is
 seen.  Mild cardiomegaly, moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal
 unchanged bilateral apical thickening.
