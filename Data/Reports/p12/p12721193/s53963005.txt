 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and positive blood culture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  An inferior vena cava filter is in
 place.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  Mild subpleural thickening at each lung apex is
 also unchanged.  There is a patchy density partly effacing each costophrenic
 angle, suggesting there may be very small pleural effusions with associated
 atelectasis.  Although there is persistent patchy right lower lung
 opacification, probably for the most part in the right middle lobe, the lungs
 are much better aerated than on the prior examination.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lower lung opacities, particularly in the posterior left
 costophrenic angle, possibly pneumonia but more likely persistent or resolving
 atelectasis associated with decreased pleural effusions.
