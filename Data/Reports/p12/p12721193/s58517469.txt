                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  History of right-sided pleural effusion status post evacuation,
 presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again enlarged.  A moderate interstitial abnormality
 is consistent with pulmonary edema.  In addition to an existing loculated
 pleural effusion along the lateral right lower chest, there is an increasing
 moderate-sized pleural effusion which probably has a free-flowing component,
 but also likely a loculated element potentially along the right upper lateral
 chest.  However, some of this appearance may be due to parenchymal
 consolidation.  The left base is also newly opacified, which may correspond to
 consolidation, loculated pleural effusion or both.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and new multifocal
 opacities, for the most part suggestive of pleural effusions including
 suspected loculated elements, as well as atelectasis.  One or more pneumonic
 consolidations, potentially infectious, are not excluded, however.
