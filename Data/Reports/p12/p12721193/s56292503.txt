  Status post right chest tube with decrease in right pleural effusion. Right
  basilar atelectasis noted. Increased interstitial markings suggestive of mild
  edema. Increased left basilar opacities suggesting atelectasis; however, an
  early developing infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical
  setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracoscopy, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracoscopy.  The patient now has two right-sided chest tubes that are
 in correct position.  There is no evidence for the presence of a right
 pneumothorax.  A small amount of air is included in the soft tissues at the
 site of tube insertion.  The pre-existing right pleural effusion has
 substantially decreased in extent.  However, an atelectasis has newly occurred
 at the level of the left lung base.  Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary
 edema persists.
