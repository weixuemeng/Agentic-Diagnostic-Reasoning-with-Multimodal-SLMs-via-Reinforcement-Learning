 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, tachycardia, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 appearing borderline enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Patchy left basilar opacity is again noted, with a small
 left pleural effusion demonstrated.  No right-sided pleural effusion is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar patchy opacity could reflect pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting with small left pleural effusion.
