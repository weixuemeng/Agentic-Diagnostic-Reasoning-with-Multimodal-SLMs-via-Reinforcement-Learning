                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 bibasilar opacities, more so on the left, which could be due to atelectasis,
 although an early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to minimally enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar opacities, developing infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
