                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There are plate-like opacities in the lower lungs suggesting
 atelectasis. A large pulmonary nodule is visible at the right lung base and
 has been characterized previously. There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy atelectasis and similar nodule at the right base.  Evaluation for any
 potential small change is limited, however.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
