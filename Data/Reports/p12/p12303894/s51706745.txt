                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes.  Right medial basilar opacity seen on the frontal
 view, not substantiated on the lateral view, may relate to atelectasis or
 overlap of vascular structures.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right mid-to-lower lung
 calcified subcentimeter nodule is seen in both the frontal and lateral views
 likely represents a calcified granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
