                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV lung cancer, progressive cough, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased volume
 loss in the left upper lung, surrounding the known large left upper lobe mass.
 In the interval, areas of fibrosis have newly occurred, contributing to the
 volume loss and to a leftward mediastinal shift.  In addition, there is a
 minimal increase in left upper lobe lung density, potentially associated with
 early pneumonia.  
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions, no abnormalities in
 the right lung, except for a known and stable linear fibrosis at the right
 lung apex.
 
 At the time of dictation, ___, 2:52 p.m., the referring physician,
 ___. ___ was paged for notification.
