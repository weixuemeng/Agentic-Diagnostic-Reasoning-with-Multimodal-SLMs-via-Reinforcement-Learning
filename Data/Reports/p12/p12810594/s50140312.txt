                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stage IV squamous cell lung cancer, complaining of productive
 cough, now with one teaspoon hemoptysis.  Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The dense opacity in the left upper lobe secondary to mass and
 radiation-induced atelectasis is unchanged.  Volume loss in the left upper
 lobe results in chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The opacity in
 the left mid lobe is smaller or nearly resolved.  Right apical scarring is
 unchanged and the remainder of the right lung appears normal.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes and pleural contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of bronchial
 obstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The opacity in the left mid lobe is smaller or nearly resolved. 
 There is no other appreciable change from two days prior and no findings on
 this routine radiograph to explain hemoptysis.
