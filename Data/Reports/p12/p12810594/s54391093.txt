                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic lung cancer with upper respiratory infection,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dense
 consolidation is again seen with the left upper lobe which is stable from
 recent CT and compatible with metastatic disease.  There is no evidence of
 superimposed pneumonia.  A vague nodular opacity in the left mid lung likely
 represents an area of scarring as seen on prior CT.  The right lung remains
 well inflated.  No gross change in the overall cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
 Carotid calcifications are noted in the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large consolidation in the left upper lobe compatible with known
 malignancy without definite signs of superimposed pneumonia.
