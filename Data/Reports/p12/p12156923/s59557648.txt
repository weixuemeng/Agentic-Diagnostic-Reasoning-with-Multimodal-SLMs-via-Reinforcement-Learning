                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with placement of right PICC and removal of
 right PA catheter  // eval for PICC line tip
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  It
 replaced with a sheath that overlies the proximal/mid SVC.
 
 Again seen is a right subclavian PICC line.  The PICC line is now visible in
 the mediastinum.  The tip overlies the upper right atrium.  This could be
 retracted by approximately 3 cm to lie in the distal SVC near the SVC/RA
 junction.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the upper right atrium and could be
 retracted by approximately 3 cm.
