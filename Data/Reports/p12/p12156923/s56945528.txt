                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CT removed  // Please eval for ptx,
 perform exam at 6 am ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the radiograph of ___, a right pleural catheter has been
 removed, with no visible pneumothorax.  Diffuse pulmonary opacities are
 similar to the prior radiograph, with the exception of worsening opacity in
 the left retrocardiac region.  This probably represents atelectasis in the
 setting of an enlarging adjacent pleural effusion.  No other relevant change.
