                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p bilateral chest tube placement.  Please
 assess for interval change in effusions, pigtail placement and PTX.  // as
 below
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of left and right chest tubes with subsequent decrease in
 size of the pleural effusions bilaterally.  The tip of the right PICC line
 projects over the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Diffuse patchy and confluent airspace opacities bilaterally likely reflect
 underlying pulmonary edema and atelectasis.  A trace left apical pneumothorax
 is visualized.
 
 The size the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of bilateral chest tubes with a subsequent decrease in size
 of the pleural effusions bilaterally.  There are persisting patchy and
 confluent airspace opacities which likely reflect pulmonary edema and
 atelectasis.
 
 Trace left apical pneumothorax.
