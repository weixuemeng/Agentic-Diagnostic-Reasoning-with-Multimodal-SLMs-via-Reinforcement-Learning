                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rising WBC  // eval for acute
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the  right pulmonary artery distally,
 possibly a right upper lobe branch, and lies more distal on the prior study. 
 Clinical correlation regarding retraction of the Swan-Ganz catheter tip is
 requested.
 
 Again seen is the Dobbhoff type orogastric tube, which extends beneath the
 diaphragm off film.  Surgical ___ are seen over the upper abdomen and
 midline.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Again seen is vascular plethora
 consistent with CHF, though this appears slightly improved.  Also again seen
 is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right base.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles
 --___ possibility of small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of Swan-Ganz catheter positioned more distal lesion on today's study
 --___ correlation regarding possible retraction requested.
 
 Vascular prominence consistent with CHF again seen, though slightly improved.
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
