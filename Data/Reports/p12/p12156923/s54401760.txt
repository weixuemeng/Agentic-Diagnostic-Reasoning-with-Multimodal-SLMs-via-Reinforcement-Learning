                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AAA with rising WBC  // eval for opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PICC line tip appears to been retracted in the interval up interim in overlies
 distal most SVC.  Vascular plethora appears increased.  Right IJ sheath has
 been removed.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Retrocardiac
 opacity and platelike atelectasis at the left base with small left effusion
 again noted.  Minimal atelectasis noted the right base.  No pneumothorax
 detected trace
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in CHF.  Mild increase in atelectasis at the right base.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with small left effusion is
 similar to the prior film.  The possibility of an infectious pneumonic
 consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
