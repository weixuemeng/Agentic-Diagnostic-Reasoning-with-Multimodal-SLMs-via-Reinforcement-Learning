                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS: Extensive calcified pleural plaques bilaterally suggest prior
 asbestos exposure and slightly limit evaluation of the underlying lung
 parenchyma.  Within this limitation, there is no radiographic evidence for new
 pulmonary consolidation.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema is detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with aortic
 tortuosity and mild cardiomegaly.   
 
 IMPRESSION: Extensive calcified pleural plaques, suggestive of prior asbestos
 exposure, without definite sign of pneumonia.
