                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___ year old with low-grade fever, poor handling of
 secretions, question acute process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation.  Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect bibasilar
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient rotation between studies.  Right seventh posterolateral rib
 fracture is again identified, likely subacute as there does appear to be some
 evidence of callus formation.  Other more inferior right-sided rib fractures
 are not as well visualized on today's study.  No pneumothorax.
