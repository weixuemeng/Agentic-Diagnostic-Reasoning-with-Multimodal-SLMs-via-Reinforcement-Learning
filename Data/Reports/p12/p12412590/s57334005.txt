                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, history of right rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evidence of
 multiple right-sided rib fractures are seen, involving at the least the right
 sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs.  The T10 through T12 ribs are not well
 seen.  There is a small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  Left
 retrocardiac basilar and minimal right base lung opacity may relate to
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There may be
 a small right apical pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aorta is calcified and somewhat tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures including at least right sixth through
 ninth ribs which are somewhat displaced.  Per report from ___
 ___ from ___, that report indicated a displaced right lateral
 seventh rib fracture, today there are additional rib fractures and there may
 have been interval injury in the interval.
 
 2.  Possible small right apical pneumothorax.  CT scan pending.
 
 3.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
