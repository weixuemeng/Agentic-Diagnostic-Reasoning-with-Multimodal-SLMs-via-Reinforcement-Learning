                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal interstitial edema.  Bibasilar opacities most likely relate to
 interstitial edema and atelectasis, although a developing consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The aorta remains calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Evidence of multiple prior
 lateral right-sided rib fractures is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities most likely
 relate to interstitial edema and atelectasis, although a developing
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
