 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a persistent opacity at the left base, similar to the prior exam. 
 This likely represents a pneumonia, and less likely reexpansion edema given

 effusion, which is not significantly changed since one day ago. Overall, the
 volume of fluid is significantly decreased since the patient's initial
 presentation.  There is a new tiny left apical pneumothorax.  The right lung
 is clear. A tiny right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no right
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 2. Unchanged small residual left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity.
 3. Unchanged tiny right pleural effusion.
