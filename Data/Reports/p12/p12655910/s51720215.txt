                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent effusions of unclear etiology and
 most recently with nodular opacities at lung bases  // progression of basilar
 opacities     progression of basilar opacities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. The
 multiple nodular opacities at the lung bases are again seen with small pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectatic changes.  On plain radiographs is
 difficult to assess for progression of the nodules, which were much better
 seen on previous CT scans.
