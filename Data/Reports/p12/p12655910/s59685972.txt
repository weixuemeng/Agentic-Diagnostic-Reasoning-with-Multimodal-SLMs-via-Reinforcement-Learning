                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (portable AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with exudative pleural effusion, s/p chest
 tube. Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The position of the left chest tube is difficult to assess, as its tip is
 presumed to be superimposed over ribs and bowel. There is residual left
 pleural effusion. Lung volumes are low, producing bronchovascular crowding and
 basilar atelectasis, and making assessment of the lung bases difficult.  No
 pneumothorax or large right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Residual left pleural effusion. Left chest tube position is difficult to
 assess.
 
 2. For evaluation of the lung bases, PA and lateral chest x-ray with the
 patient taking a deeper breath, if possible, is recommended.
