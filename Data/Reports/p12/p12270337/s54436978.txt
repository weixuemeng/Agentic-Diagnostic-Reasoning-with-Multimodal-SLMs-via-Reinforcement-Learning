                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with asthma and dyspnea.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are mildly hyperexpanded.  Slightly increased density over the inferior spine
 on the lateral view without correlate on the frontal view may represent
 atelectasis, but early or developing infection cannot be excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly increased opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral
 view may represent early or developing infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
