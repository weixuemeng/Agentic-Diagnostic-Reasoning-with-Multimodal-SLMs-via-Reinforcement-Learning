                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, new NG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Again seen is a large hiatal hernia.  An NG tube is present.  The tip overlies
 the hernia, terminating at the level of the diaphragms.  The sideport lies at
 the top of the hernia, in the region of the GE junction.  No CHF or gross
 effusion.  Focal opacity at the right base laterally is noted, though likely
 represents an artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  
 
 Aside from change in position  (retraction) of the NG tube, no significant
 interval change identified, compared with ___ at 7:28 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large hiatal hernia.
 2.  NG tube overlies the hiatal hernia within the chest, but does not pass
 distal to the level of the diaphragms.  The sideport lies in the region of the
 GE junction.
