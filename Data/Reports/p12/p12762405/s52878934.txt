                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, cough  // pneumonia?
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities within
 the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  Early infection, however, is
 not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
