 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest wall pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 clear and well inflated.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Tiny clips project over the right chest wall with asymmetric
 appearance of the breast soft tissue which suggests prior surgical
 intervention.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  There is calcification
 curvilinear along the proximal descending aorta which is stable from prior
 exam.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
