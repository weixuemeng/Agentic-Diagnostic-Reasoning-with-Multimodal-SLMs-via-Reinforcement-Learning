  Persistent right lower lobe opacity, not significantly changed from the prior
  exam.  No new opacity, edema, or effusion.  The mediastinal contours are less
  wide, suggesting the widening in the prior exam was positional.  The lucency
  overlying the right lung is less apparent, though likely still present, making
  a small anterior pneumothorax difficult to exclude.  Results discussed with
  Dr. ___ at ___ AM on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the
  findings were discovered.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low, but are slightly greater than on the prior
 study.  The previously noted widening of the mediastinum is slightly less
 apparent.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as linear
 juxtahilar and basilar foci of atelectasis.  Small pleural effusions are
 evident bilaterally.  Previously reported lucency adjacent to the right
 cardiomediastinal contour has decreased in extent.  If warranted clinically,
 lateral decubitus radiograph could be considered to exclude a small
 anteromedial right pneumothorax.
