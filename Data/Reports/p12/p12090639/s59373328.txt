 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Epigastric/chest pain, evaluate for wide mediastinum.

 relatively low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
