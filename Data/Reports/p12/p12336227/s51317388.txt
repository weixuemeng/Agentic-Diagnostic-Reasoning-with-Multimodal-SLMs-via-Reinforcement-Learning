                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right hilar mass, status post bronchoscopy, complicated by right
 upper lobe collapse, assess interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 Compared with ___, opacity in the left upper zone is again seen. There is
 now more dense confluent opacification along the inferolateral border of the
 right upper lobe.  The cranial convex border of the opacities suggest right
 upper lobe collapse. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change. The mediastinum remains grossly
 midline, allowing for patient rotation.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lobe opacity, likely right upper lobe collapse, slightly worse compared
 with most recent prior film.
