                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  New onset of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs are available from ___.  PET-CT and diagnostic chest CT studies are available from ___ and
 ___, respectively.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Marked volume loss of the right upper lobe has mostly resolved.  There is
 similar mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There
 is also much less density associated with the right hilum with persistent
 streaky right infrahilar opacification, but markedly reduced, suggesting
 residual atelectasis or scarring in the right middle lobe.  Mild biapical
 pleural thickening appears stable.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in right upper lobe opacification and volume
 loss, with no definite evidence for pneumonia.
