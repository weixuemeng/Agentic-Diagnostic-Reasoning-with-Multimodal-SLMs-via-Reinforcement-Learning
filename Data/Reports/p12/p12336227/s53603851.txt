                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer, undergoing radiation therapy; found orthostatic at
 radiation today.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged, as before.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a
 similar mild interstitial abnormality and an irregular appearance of
 interstitial markings in the upper lungs suggestive of emphysema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities in the lingula and left
 lower lobe suggest minor atelectasis, unchanged.  The bones are probably
 demineralized.  Minimal degenerative changes are present along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality probably reflecting airway disease
 and emphysema with no definite acute process.
