                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with R ear pain, dizziness  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. Relative rounded left base retrocardiac opacity with at least a
 couple of lucencies within has appearance suggestive of a hernia containing
 bowel/stomach.  Upon discussion with the resident taking care of the patient,
 the patient does not currently have a cough or other pulmonary symptoms.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Right paratracheal opacity without
 indentation on the trachea most likely relates to prominent vasculature and/or
 mediastinal fat.  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  Degenerative
 changes are seen in the bilateral glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded left base retrocardiac opacity with lucencies within is most
 suggestive of a hernia containing bowel/stomach.  This could be confirmed on
 chest CT.  Of note, per the emergency medicine physician resident, the patient
 does not have pulmonary symptoms.
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
