 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with one week of cough and bibasilar rales, with
 his partner being treated for pneumonia.  Evaluate for infiltrate.  Patient
 also reports history of histoplasmosis as a child.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are multiple bilateral calcified nodular opacities, more
 numerous in the right lung, ranging up to 8 mm in the right mid lung region. 
 There are also multiple calcified bilateral hilar and mediastinal  lymph
 nodes.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral calcified pulmonary nodules and calcified
 bilateral hilar and mediastonal lymphadenopathy may represent sequela of
 patient's prior histoplasmosis infection.  No defintie evidence of active
 cardiopulmonary process.
