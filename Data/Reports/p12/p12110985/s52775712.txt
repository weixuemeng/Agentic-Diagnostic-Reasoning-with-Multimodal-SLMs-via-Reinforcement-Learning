                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, history of CHF and metastatic
 melanoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___ and film from ___.
 
 There are innumerable bilateral nodular opacities throughout the lungs
 bilaterally suspicious for significant interval progression of metastatic
 disease.  There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which could
 potentially be due to small effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral nodular opacities in lungs suspicious for
 progression of metastatic disease.  No definite pulmonary edema or new
 confluent consolidation, although subtle changes may be missed due to
 extensive burden of metastatic disease.
