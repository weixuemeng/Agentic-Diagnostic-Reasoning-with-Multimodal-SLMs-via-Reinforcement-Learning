                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  An area of opacification
 overlying the heart on lateral view may represent focal consolidation. The
 lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible opacity in the right middle lobe projecting over the heart may
 reflect developing pneumonia.  No evidence of consolidation or other acute
 cardiopulmonary process elsewhere.
