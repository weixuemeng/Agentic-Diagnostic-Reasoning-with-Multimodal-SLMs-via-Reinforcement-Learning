                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent CABG.  Evaluation for interval change, pleural effusions
 and atelectasis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors, beginning on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right IJ catheter terminates in standard position.  Median
 sternotomy wires, CABG clips, and the cardiomediastinal silhouette are stable.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  However, bilateral pleural
 effusions and associated atelectasis are unchanged.
