                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of CABG a week ago,
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen, which may be secondary to small pleural effusions as well
 as overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation difficult to exclude. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There has been interval
 removal of previously seen right-sided internal jugular catheter.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged, although appears somewhat improved since the
 prior study which may relate to differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely representing combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
