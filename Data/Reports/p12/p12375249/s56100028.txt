 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:44 PM
  New right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  There is
  no pneumothorax.  Remaining findings are otherwise not significantly changed. 
  As before, there is redemonstration of wispy opacities in both lungs which
  likely correspond to pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT examination. 
  Dedicated chest CT should be considered to better characterize.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, evaluate central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest was obtained with patient
 in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___ at
 11:36, and a CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central
 venous line, with the tip seen terminating within the lower SVC.  No
 associated pneumothorax identified. Redemonstrated are small, bilateral,
 parenchymal opacities which likely correspond with the patient's known
 metastatic disease.  A small, left pleural effusion is again noted. Mild,
 interstitial pulmonary edema is seen. There is no lobar consolidation
 identified. Moderate cardiomegaly is noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable. Sternotomy wires are noted to be well aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral, diffuse wispy opacities which likely represent the patient's
 known metastatic disease.  A dedicated CT chest examination is recommended for
 further characterization.  
 
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly, mild interstial pulonary edema, and a small left
 pleural effusion.
