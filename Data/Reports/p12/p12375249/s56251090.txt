  1.  New increased mild bibasilar opacities, as compared to outside chest
  radiograph from ___, these could reflect atelectasis, however an

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer here for acute back pain.  Rule out
 pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior abdominal /pelvic CT from ___ and outside
 chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung
 volumes are decreased.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.    Wispy opacities in
 both lungs correspond with pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT examination from
 ___.  There is a probable small left pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Wispy opacities in both lungs correspond with pulmonary nodules
 seen on CT examination from ___. However,a dedicated chest CT
 should be considered to better characterize.
