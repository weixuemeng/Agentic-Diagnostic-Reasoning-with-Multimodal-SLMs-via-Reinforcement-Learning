                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, status post NGT placement.  Assess tube placement.
 
 Chest, single AP portable view, with additional post-processing.  
 
 An NG tube is present, though tip is not optimally visualized due to
 underpenetration. However, it appears to lie distal to the GE junction.  If
 clinically indicated, a repeat film can be obtained at no additional charge to
 the patient. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone redistribution and possible
 mild vascular blurring, without other evidence of CHF.  There is probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Doubt frank consolidation.  No effusion.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 3:53 a.m., the upper zone redistribution is slightly
 worse, but is also likely accentuated by technique.
