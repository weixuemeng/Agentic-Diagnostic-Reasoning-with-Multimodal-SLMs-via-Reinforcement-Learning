                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ -- ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The extensive
 biapical upper lobe opacities have nearly completely resolved.    There are
 minimal faint peripheral speckled opacities in the right upper and left upper
 lobes at the sites of prior multifocal consolidations.  No new consolidations,
 effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of multifocal predominantly upper lobe
 pulmonary opacities.  The marked improvement in response to steroids is
 consistent with the presumptive diagnosis Churg-___ syndrome.  However,
 this response would also fit with eosinophilic pneumonia.
 
 Findings were discussed via telephone with Dr. ___ at 4 p.m. on ___.
