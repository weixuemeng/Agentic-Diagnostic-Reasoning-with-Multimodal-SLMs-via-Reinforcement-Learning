                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with eosinophilic pneumonia, on slow
 prednisone taper, assess for any return of upper lobe infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  Mild cardiac enlargement as
 before, no typical configurational abnormalities identified.  Unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta and no mediastinal abnormalities are seen. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Thus, in comparison with the next
 preceding chest examination of ___, no evidence of new infiltrates or
 recurrence of the, on preceding examination of ___, identified
 bilateral apical infiltrates interpreted as an eosinophilic pneumonia.
 
 The patient has chronic mild cardiac enlargement, previous history of atrial
 fibrillation, is noteworthy that the pulmonary vasculature demonstrate a mild
 degree of upper zone redistribution on examination of ___, a finding which
 now has normalized completely on the present examination.  Thus, the
 radiographically identified mild degree of pulmonary congestion has
 disappeared presently.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No reoccurrence of eosinophilic infiltrates.
