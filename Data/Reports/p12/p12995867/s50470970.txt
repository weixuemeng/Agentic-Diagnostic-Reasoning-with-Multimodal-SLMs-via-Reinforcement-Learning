 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest.  Bilateral diffuse
 airspace opacities with a perihilar predominance are concerning for pulmonary

 significantly more enlarged than the left hilar contours.  There are small
 bialteral pleural effusions and cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Read in conjunction with the same day chest CT. Enlargement of the
 right hilar contours, much significantly more than the left hilar contours,
 corresponds to soft tissue around right hilus seen on CT that is presumed to
 be malignant lymphadenopathy or a mass. Mild pulmonary edema due to congestive
 heart failure.
