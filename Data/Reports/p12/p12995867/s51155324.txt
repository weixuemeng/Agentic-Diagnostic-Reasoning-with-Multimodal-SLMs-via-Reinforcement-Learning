  Markedly improved aeration of the bilateral lungs.  Stable fullness of the

  Stable large of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, which corresponds to both prior radiographs
 and CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been dramatic improvement in perihilar opacities and
 pleural effusions.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is
 partly calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right hilar fullness is now minimal.  It is not necessarily the
 case that there is a soft tissue mass in the right hilum based on the imaging,
 but it would be appropriate to continue with radiographic follow-up and also
 to a repeat chest CT within several weeks in order to show complete resolution
 of perihilar opacities and exclude a subtle soft tissue mass.
