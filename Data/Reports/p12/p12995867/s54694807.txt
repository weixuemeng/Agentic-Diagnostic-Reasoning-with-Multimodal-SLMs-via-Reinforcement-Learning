                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with leukocytosis, rales on exam and right
 hilar fullness.  No fever, no cough, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ AT ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  Both hila are prominent on the
 current examination which may represent prominent pulmonary arteries such as
 seen with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  However, as there is a question of
 a hilar mass on recent chest CT dated ___, follow up imaging with CT once
 the patient's symptoms resolve is advised. There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  A
 more focal opacity in the right medial base is now seen, which could again
 reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of the vasculature, and no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
