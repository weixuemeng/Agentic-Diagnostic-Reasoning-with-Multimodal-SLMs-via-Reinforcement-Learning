                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Potential cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  There is mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, caused by a slightly overinflated left colonic flexure.  The
 diaphragm is elevated posteriorly, potentially representing a small
 eventration with a subsequent atelectasis, better seen on the lateral than on
 the frontal radiograph.  There is no evidence of pulmonary nodules or masses. 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.  Normal size
 and shape of the cardiac silhouette.
