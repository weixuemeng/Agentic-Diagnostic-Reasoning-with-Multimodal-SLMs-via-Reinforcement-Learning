                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Difficulty breathing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  A nasogastric
 tube passes into the stomach.  Part of a biliary drain projects over the
 epigastric region.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity is most suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity on the left which may be due to atelectasis,
 probably unchanged.
