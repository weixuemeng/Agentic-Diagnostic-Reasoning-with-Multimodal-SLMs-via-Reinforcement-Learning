                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with NGT d/t bowel obstruction.  Assess NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip coiled in stomach and
 side ports below the level of the diaphragm.  A right porta cath tip is seen
 in the low SVC.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is present.  Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low
 lung volumes and patient positioning. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Multiple clips and percutaneous gastrojejunostomy catheter is partially
 imaged.  Limited assessment of the upper abdomen again demonstrates multiple
 mildly dilated air-filled loops of small bowel measuring up to 4.8 cm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Enteric feeding tube in appropriate position with tip in stomach.
 2. Hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Multiple dilated small bowel loops are similar to prior examination and
 partially visualized.
