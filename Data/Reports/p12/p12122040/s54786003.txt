  1. ET tube ends above the clavicles and could be advanced by approximately 3
  cm for more secure positioning.
  
  2. Enteric tube with the tip in the stomach but the side hole above the level
  of the GE junction.
  
  3. Left subclavian central venous catheter in appropriate position.
  
  4. Right lower lung opacities could represent a combination of atelectasis,

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest, question central venous line placement and ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ET tube ending in 9.3
 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in
 the mid SVC.  An enteric tube is seen with the tip in the stomach but the side
 hole above the GE junction.  Heart size is normal.  Retrocardiac and right
 lower lung opacities are most consistent with aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube ends above the clavicles and could be advanced by approximately 3
 cm for more secure positioning.
 
 2. Enteric tube with the tip in the stomach but the side hole above the level
 of the GE junction.
 
 3. Left subclavian central venous catheter in appropriate position.
 
 4. Right lower lung and retrocardiac opacities most likely represent
 aspiration.
