                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness after fall with elevated temperature, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle consistent with some pleural fluid.  The questioned
 cortical stepoff in the left distal clavicle is at the far end of the image
 and difficult to assess.  If there is clinical suspicion for a fracture,
 shoulder views would be recommended.
