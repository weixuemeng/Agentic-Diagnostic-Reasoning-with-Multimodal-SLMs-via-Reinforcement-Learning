 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits for age. No CHF,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.
 
 No displaced rib fracture is detected on these lung technique films.  Possible
 subtle pleural thickening along the right chest wall in the mid some There is
 mildly accentuated thoracic spine kyphosis, with mild multilevel degenerative
 changes and with slight anterior wedging of several mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies, that does not appear acute. The sternum is not well visualized due to

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If concern for a rib fracture persists,
 dedicated rib series with markers would be recommended.
