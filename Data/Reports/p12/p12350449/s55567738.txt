                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with decreased breath sounds on the left.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, with underlying compressive
 atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
