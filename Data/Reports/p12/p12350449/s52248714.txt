                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is somewhat obscured by the
 presence of a moderate left pleural effusion, relatively unchanged compared to
 the prior exam.  Small right pleural effusion also persists.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged, with calcification of the thoracic aorta
 again noted.  Lung volumes are reduced, with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Left basilar opacity
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. 
 Mild loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions, relatively unchanged with
 persistent left basilar opacification likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.
