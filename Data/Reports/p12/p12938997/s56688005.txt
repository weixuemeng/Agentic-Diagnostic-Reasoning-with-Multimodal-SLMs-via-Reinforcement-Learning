                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epigastric pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead pacer
 is unchanged.  Wispy opacities in the lower lungs are similar to that seen on
 prior CT and likely represent areas of scarring.  Dense mitral annular
 calcification is again noted.  There is no new consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contour is stable with
 atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of scarring appear stable in the lower lungs.  No acute
 findings in the chest.
