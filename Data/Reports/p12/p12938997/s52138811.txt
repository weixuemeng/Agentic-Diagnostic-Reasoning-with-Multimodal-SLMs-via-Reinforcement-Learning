                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with Right IJ, pulled back  // Eval line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:26.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, right-sided central venous catheter has been retracted.  The tip
 now projects over the lower SVC.  Otherwise, there has been no change.  Low
 lung volumes are noted with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely due in part to atelectasis although underlying
 infection/effusion would be possible.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits, dense mitral annular calcifications are noted.  Left chest wall
 dual lead pacing device is again noted.
