                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abd pain, ?ischemic esophagus on OSH endoscopy.
 // eval for free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 Streaky, bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, which likely represent
 atelectasis. The left costophrenic angle is somewhat blunted, which may
 reflect a small pleural effusion versus chronic scarring. The descending
 thoracic aorta is unfolded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 grossly within normal limits and without evidence of pneumomediastinum.  No
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis, with aspiration felt to be less likely.  No convincing evidence
 for pneumomediastinum.
