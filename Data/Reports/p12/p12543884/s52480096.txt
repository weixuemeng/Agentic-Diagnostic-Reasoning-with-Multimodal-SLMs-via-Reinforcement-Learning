                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again noted, which slightly limit
 assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma.  There are minimal streaky
 opacities in the lung bases possibly reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, with the heart size appearing top normal.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present.  The aorta remains tortuous at tortuous.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques compatible with prior asbestos exposure. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis.
