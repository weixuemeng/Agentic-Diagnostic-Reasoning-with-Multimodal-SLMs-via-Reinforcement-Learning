 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with continued dyspnea and low-grade fevers,
 question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 13:16 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There are multiple calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques consistent with
 prior asbestos exposure.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  Calcified granuloma in the right apex is again seen.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions best appreciated on the lateral projection are now
 present.  The aorta is unfolded and tortuous.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Of note, on the recent CT of ___, the patient did
 have mucus plugging within the lower lobe bronchi, although these changes are
 not appreciated on the plain film examination.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
