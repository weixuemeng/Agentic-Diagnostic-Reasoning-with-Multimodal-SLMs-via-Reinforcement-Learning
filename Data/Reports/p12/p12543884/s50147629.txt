                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for pneumonia. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are lower in comparison to the prior study.  There is some
 opacification of the left base which may represent atelectasis and less likely
 pneumonia, that could be better evaluated with PA and lateral radiographs. 
 Again seen are multiple calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques consistent
 with prior asbestos exposure.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unchanged. The pleural surfaces are normal without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacification seen at the left base, which is most consistent with atelectasis
 and less likely pneumonia however differences in projection and levels of
 inspiration make it difficult to compare. Suggest PA and lateral radiographs
 for better evaluation.
