                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonectomy, now with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax with striking displacement of
 mediastinal contents to that side, consistent with the history of prior
 pneumonectomy.  The left lung is essentially clear with no evidence of
 pneumonia or vascular congestion.
