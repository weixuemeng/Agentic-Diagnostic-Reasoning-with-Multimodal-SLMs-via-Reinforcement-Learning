                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening shortness of breath.  Question
 effusion.  History of sarcoidosis, status post left upper lobectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is a
 moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with possible underlying
 atelectasis versus possible consolidation.  There is some pleural thickening
 seen laterally at the left lung base without definite consolidation or
 evidence of pulmonary vascular redistribution.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Surgical chain sutures seen at the left hilum
 compatible with history of left upper lobectomy.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion and underlying
 atelectasis; however, consolidation is not excluded.  Postoperative changes of
 left upper lobectomy.
