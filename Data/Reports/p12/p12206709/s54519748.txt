                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracocentesis with possible tiny pneumothorax
 on the right side requiring interval followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously described small right basal pneumothorax on ___
 radiograph, which apparently appeared following thoracocentesis, is no more
 visualized; however, mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion has minimally
 increased.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion on the left
 side.  No other interval changes in the chest.
