                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right pneumothorax, chest tube.  // please
 assess for pneumo.      please assess for pneumo.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16 57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 07:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is some overlying motion artifact which limits the examination.  A right
 basilar chest tube remains in place.  There is air within the right lateral
 chest wall and neck soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. 
 Rounded lucency at the right apex likely represents a small pneumothorax. 
 There is bilateral parenchymal distortion with fibrotic changes at the bases
 consistent with fibrotic lung disease.  Multiple small nodular opacities with
 associated right apical pleural thickening are again seen and may reflect
 prior granulomatous infection.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
