                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post pigtail placement.  Evaluation for
 reinflation of the previously seen pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest right is radiographs ___, performed 2 hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new right lateral approach apical pigtail catheter ends over the posterior
 fifth and sixth rib interspace.  The previously seen right apical loculated
 pneumothorax has decreased in size.  A small amount of right apical loculated
 effusion persists.  A right lower lobe effusion is stable.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is stable. 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease is re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right apical pigtail catheter with resultant decrease
 in size of a now small right apical pneumothorax and right apical loculated
 effusion.
