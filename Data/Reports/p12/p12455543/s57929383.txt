  Right apical opacity may be due to prominent apical thickening/scarring,
  correlate with more remote radiographs to ensure stability, if not, consider
  followup chest CT. Bibasilar reticular opacities suggest chronic lung disease.
  Relative lucency of the mid lungs likely relates to pulmonary emphysema.
  
  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a small right pleural
  effusion.  Right chest tube is seen.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the right
  chest wall.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pnuemo at OSH, chest tube placed, images
 getting uploaded of prior  // residual pnuemothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:56 from___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right apical opacity may be due to prominent apical thickening/scarring,
 correlate with more remote radiographs to ensure stability, if not, consider
 followup chest CT.  Bibasilar reticular opacities suggest chronic lung
 disease.  Relative lucency of the mid lungs likely relates to pulmonary
 emphysema.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a
 small right pleural effusion.  Right chest tube is seen coursing into the
 right lower chest.  Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is again seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
