  Moderate size right pneumothorax is little changed compared to the previous
  exam from 11:13 today with continued atelectasis of the right lung and mild
  leftward shift of mediastinal structures suggesting mild element of tension. 
  Small right pleural effusion, bullous emphysema, and chronic fibrosing
  interstitial lung disease is re- demonstrated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, outside chest radiograph ___ at 11:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate size right pneumothorax is again demonstrated, little changed from
 the previous radiograph obtained earlier today at 11:13, with mild leftward
 shift of mediastinal structures, also unchanged.  A small right pleural
 effusion is also again noted, not substantially changed in the interval. 
 Heart size remains top-normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Atelectasis
 in the right lung is again noted, with diffusely increased interstitial
 opacities, most pronounced at the lung bases, compatible with a fibrosing
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  Emphysema is again noted with bulla seen
 within the right lung base.  Coarse calcifications was scarring in the upper
 lobes is re- demonstrated.  Mild wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate size right pneumothorax is little changed compared to the previous
 exam from 11:13 today with continued atelectasis of the right lung and mild
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures suggesting mild element of tension.
 2. Small right pleural effusion, bullous emphysema, and chronic fibrosing
 interstitial lung disease is re- demonstrated.
