                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known CAD s/p drug eluting stenting, AAA,
 known aortic stenosis/AI who presented to___ on ___ with CHF,
 SOB and ___ edema now being transferred for cardiac surgery evaluation and
 diuresis.  // eval for CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aortic and hilar contours are obscured by the
 surrounding parenchymal changes.
 
 There are extensive increased interstitial markings in both lungs, with more
 honeycomb appearance in the right upper zone.  The appearance is suggestive of
 chronic parenchymal scarring, but the possibility of a superimposed
 interstitial process or interstitial edema would be difficult to exclude. 
 Probable background blebs and bullae in both lungs.
 
 Minimal blunting of left-greater-than-right costophrenic angles.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity, also of uncertain etiology or acuity.  Asymmetric left
 apical pleural thickening noted.
 
 A metallic BB overlies the right lung base.  Based on this single frontal
 view, this could either lie within or outside of the the patient.
 
 Probable background osteopenia.  There is an apparent ununited fracture of the
 lateral portion of the right clavicle at the level of the coracoid.  No
 displacement or elevation is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable background COPD, with extensive parenchymal scarring and bulla
 formation, not fully evaluated by radiograph.
 2. Diffuse increased interstitial markings in both lungs.  While these likely
 represent chronic changes, the possibility of an acute superimposed
 interstitial process including, but not limited to CHF, cannot be excluded.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.
 4. Asymmetric pleural thickening at the left lung apex.  Correlation with
 previous (outside) radiographs is recommended to exclude developing neoplasm. 
 If not available, then further assessment with CT would be recommended.
 5. BB over right lung base --___ within or outside the the patient.  If
 MRI is contemplated, then a lateral view may help to further characterize
 this.
 6. Ununited non display right clavicle fracture noted.
 
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above (re left apical pleural
 thickening) was entered by Dr. ___ on ___ at 18:14 into the
 Department of Radiology critical communications system for direct
 communication to the referring provider.
