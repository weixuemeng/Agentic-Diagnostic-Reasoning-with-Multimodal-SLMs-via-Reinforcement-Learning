                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx ILD and COPD/emphysema with worsening
 hypoxemia.  // Effusion vs. pulmonary edema vs contusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post TAVR.  Again visualized are the diffuse bilateral
 reticular interstitial opacities, worse at the bases.  This interstitial
 pattern appears to have worsened in comparison to the prior chest radiograph,
 which can only be partially explained by the decrease in lung volume.  Heart
 size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.  There is a radiodense marker in the right
 lower lung.  Surgical clips are visualized in the right upper abdomen.  There
 is a circular radiodensity projecting over the left upper abdomen, which
 likely represent an ingested pill.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in the bilateral diffuse reticular interstitial pattern, which
 represents underlying chronic interstitial lung disease with superimposed
 pulmonary edema.
