 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.  Question PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Findings are consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 that has worsened since the recent prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, increased.  PICC line
