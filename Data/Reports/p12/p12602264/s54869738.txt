                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vague abdominal pain and crackles on lung exam.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is of normal
 size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  A moderate-sized hiatal hernia
 contains an air-fluid level.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Numerous chronic appearing right rib fractures are again seen.  Thoracolumbar
 spine fusion construct with vertical fusion rods and pedicle screws appears
 similar in position to prior without evidence of hardware complication. 
 Compression deformities of the thoracolumbar junction are similar to the prior
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
