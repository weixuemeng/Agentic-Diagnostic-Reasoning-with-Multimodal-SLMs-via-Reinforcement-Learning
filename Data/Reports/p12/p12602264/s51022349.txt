                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate-to-large hiatal hernia, as before, with an
 air-fluid level.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Similar to prior findings, there are streaky horizontal opacities in both
 lower lungs, most consistent with minor scarring.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Two compression deformities along the lower
 thoracic spine, the lower one with vertebroplasty changes, appears stable. 
 Below that, posterior fusion hardware is again partly visualized.  Kyphosis is
 exaggerated.  Right-sided rib deformities are unchanged.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia.  No evidence of acute disease.
