                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fall, rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Evidence of a hiatal hernia
 is again seen with air-fluid level seen on the lateral view.  Hardware is
 partially imaged.  Compression deformities at the thoracolumbar junction are
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  
 2.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures.  No definite acute rib fracture
 seen, but if clinical concern persists, suggest dedicated rib series.
 3.  Hiatal hernia.
