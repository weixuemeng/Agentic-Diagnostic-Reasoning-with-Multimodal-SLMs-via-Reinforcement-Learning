                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post assault with pain over left clavicle and left upper
 ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for low lung volumes.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen.  No clavicular abnormality is identified on
 this frontal radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intrathoracic injury. However, CT is more
 sensitive for detection of rib fractures.
