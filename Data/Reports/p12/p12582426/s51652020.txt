                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with variceal bleed after intubation.  Evaluate for
 placement of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with extensive opacification of the bilateral lungs, right greater than left,
 the appearance is consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus aspiration.
 Based on retrospective review of radiographs from ___, the
 dramatic change over the course of the day is suggestive of contributions from
 pulmonary edema and aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, allowing for differences in patient positioning.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm from the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm from the carina.
