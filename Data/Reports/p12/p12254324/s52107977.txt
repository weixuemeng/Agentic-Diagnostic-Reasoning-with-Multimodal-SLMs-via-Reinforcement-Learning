                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 lower lobe opacity in both the frontal and lateral views could be due to a
 mild infection or atelectasis.  This is on the site opposite of that reported
 in the history.  A small rounded opacity about 2 mm projecting over the
 posterior right sixth rib was seen on multiple prior studies including dating
 back to ___ and likely represents a vessel on end.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
