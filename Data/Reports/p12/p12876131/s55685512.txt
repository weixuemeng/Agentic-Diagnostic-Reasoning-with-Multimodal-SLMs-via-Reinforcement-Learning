                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is at least mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions may be present posteriorly.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with possible trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
