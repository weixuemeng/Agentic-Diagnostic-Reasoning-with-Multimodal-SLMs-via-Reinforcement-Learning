                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever on and off with night sweats.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Questionable increased density
 and lobular contours of the left hilus are noted that potentially might
 reflect lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Given the patient's history, evaluation with chest CT is highly recommended to
 exclude the possibility of left hilar lymphadenopathy.
