                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity edema and crackles at lung bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT lumbar spine.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcifications
 at the aortic arch again redemonstrated.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  There are minimal streaky opacities at the lung bases compatible
 with atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is similar in size compared
 to the prior study.  No right-sided pleural effusion is present, and there is
 no pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine
 with loss of height of an upper lumbar vertebral body, which appears unchanged
 compared to the CT L-spine from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
 edema.
