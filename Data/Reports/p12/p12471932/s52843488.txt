                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous catheter. 
 There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and low volume on
 that side.  There has been interval decrease in previously seen bilateral
 pulmonary opacities with right infrahilar/right middle lobe opacity
 persisting, which may in part relate to atelectasis, although underlying
 consolidation may also be present.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with calcified
 mediastinum and hilar nodes again seen.
