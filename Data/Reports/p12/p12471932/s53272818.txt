                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lower abdominal pain, dyspnea, history of sarcoid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been no significant interval change since the prior study.  Marked elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm with low volume of the right lung is again seen. 
 Right infrahilar/middle lobe opacity again seen, which may relate to
 atelectasis and possible underlying consolidation.  Left retrocardiac opacity
 is also stable, better evaluated on recent CT.  Known mediastinal and hilar
 calcified lymph nodes in this patient with history of sarcoid.  A couple of
 punctate rounded calcifications in the right apex may represent calcified
 granulomas.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since the prior study of
 ___.  Persistently elevated right hemidiaphragm and bibasilar
 opacities.
