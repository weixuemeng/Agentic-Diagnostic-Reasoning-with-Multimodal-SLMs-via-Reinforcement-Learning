  with mild interstitial edema is new from prior study.  Probable small
  left-sided effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer leads.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ pacing lead projects
 over the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  Lower lung volumes with
 developing pulmonary vascular congestion and probable small pleural effusion,
 as well as poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.
