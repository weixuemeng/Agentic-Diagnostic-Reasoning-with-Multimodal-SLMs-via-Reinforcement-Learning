                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new shortness of breath.  Postoperative day ___
 after a liver transplantation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has no longer pulmonary edema.  Persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm explains some severe right lower lobe atelectasis.  Moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, could be due to
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion, but there is no pulmonary or
 mediastinal vascular engorgement.  Dual-channel right supraclavicular central
 venous line ends in the right atrium close to the tricuspid valve.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 CT scanning on ___ showed that much of the apparent enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is due to mediastinal fat deposition.  It also showed
 an increase in aortic valvular calcification raising questions of hemodynamic
 significance.  Dr. ___ was paged.
