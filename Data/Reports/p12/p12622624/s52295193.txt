                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Liver transplant, here with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In
 comparison to the prior study, there has been interval decrease in the right
 basilar opacity with residual basilar opacity remaining.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen, although a very trace residual right pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  The left lung is clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  There is stable ill-defined opacity
 in the lateral left upper lung.
