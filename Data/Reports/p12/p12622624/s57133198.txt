                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest tube in place, evaluation for right effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___. 
 Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right chest tube that was fissural in chest CT is in unchanged position.  Most
 of the right lower lung opacities are due to atelectasis and high diaphragm
 due to the liver process.  There was no significant residual or pleural
 effusion on the chest CT except for a small loculation in the fissure.  Left
 lung is unremarkable.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The exam is unchanged since yesterday with no pneumothorax.  Right lower lung
 opacity is mostly due to atelectasis and high diaphragm due to the abdominal
 process. As seen on recent CT, residual right effusion is small and loculated
 in the fissure.
