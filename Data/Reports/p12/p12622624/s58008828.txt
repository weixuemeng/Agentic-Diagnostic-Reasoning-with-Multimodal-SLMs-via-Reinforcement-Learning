                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC terminates in the lower superior vena cava just above the
 expected junction with the right atrium.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  A band-like area of atelectasis in the right juxtahilar
 region appears unchanged, and a poorly defined left upper lobe lung nodule
 also appears similar allowing for positional differences between the studies. 
 This nodule was more fully characterized on CT of ___.  Small
 right pleural effusion is again demonstrated and a drainage catheter remains
 in place in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
