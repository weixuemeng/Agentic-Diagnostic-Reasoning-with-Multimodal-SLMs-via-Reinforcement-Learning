 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:12 PM
  NeNew right sided pigtail catheter with no large pneumothorax. Moderate to
  large right pleural effusion is again noted with greater
  opacification at the base of the right lung which may be due to pneumonia or
  atelectasis.   Atelectasis again noted in the
  infrahilar left lower lobe. Also again noted is unexplained  wide nodular
  opacity projecting over the left
  second rib anteriorly and left fourth rib posteriorly which may be a lung
  lesion and requires further workup with ct.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a pigtail
 catheter in place at the right base with removal of some pleural fluid.  There
 is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with some
 atelectatic changes above it.  The upper lungs and left base are essentially
 clear.  The suggested opacification in the left upper zone is again seen and
 of uncertain etiology.  This would require CT for definitive evaluation.
