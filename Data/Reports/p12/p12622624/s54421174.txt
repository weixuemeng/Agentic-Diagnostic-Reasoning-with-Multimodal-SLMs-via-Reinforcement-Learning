                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent liver transplant, now liver abscess and
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion is increasing and there is greater
 opacification at the base of the right lung.  This could be pneumonia, but
 more likely it is atelectasis.  There is also a new abnormality in the
 infrahilar left lower lobe, also probably atelectasis.  
 
 Unexplained is a roughly ___-mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the left
 second rib anteriorly and fourth rib posteriorly.  This could be a growing
 lung lesion since I see a similar abnormality projecting over the left second
 anterior interspace yesterday.  Unfortunately resolving this question would
 require CT scanning.  Dr. ___ was paged.  
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable, exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  There is no pulmonary edema.
