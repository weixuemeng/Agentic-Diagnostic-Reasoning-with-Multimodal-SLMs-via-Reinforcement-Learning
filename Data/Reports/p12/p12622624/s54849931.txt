 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A large caliber hemodialysis catheter
 terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior.  Persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is suggestive of chronic small effusion.  There is
 unchanged right middle lobe and lower lobe atelectasis.  The remainder of the
 lungs appear clear.  There is no confluent consolidation.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged small right pleural effusion and right basilar
 atelectasis.  No change compared to recent prior examination.
