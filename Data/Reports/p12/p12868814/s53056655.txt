  3. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema are mild.  A small right
 pleural effusion was present on the prior study, with fluid now tracking into
 the minor fissure on the right.  A small left pleural effusion is new.  An
 opacity in the right base is new from the immediate prior study and may
 represent mildly asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an early infectious
 process could be considered in the proper clinical setting.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Right basilar opacity may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 infectious process in the proper clinical setting.
 3. No pneumothorax.
