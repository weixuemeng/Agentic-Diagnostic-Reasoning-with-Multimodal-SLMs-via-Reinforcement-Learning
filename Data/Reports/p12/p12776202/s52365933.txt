                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD coming in. Complains of some
 shortness of breath  // Assess for pleural effusion      Assess for pleural
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased due to
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  Lateral view would be helpful in
 assessing the volume of pleural effusion if any, but small pleural effusions
 could be present. Vascular deficiency in the upper lungs is due to emphysema. 
 Greater opacification at the lung bases could be due to vascular congestion of
 heart failure, or perhaps peribronchial infiltration due to aspiration or
 early pneumonia.
