                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anterior chest discomfort and cough, not improved with asthma
 inhalers.  Evaluate for mediastinal or hilar masses.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  Again, there
 is a linear opacity in the right lower lung zone, which is similar to the
 prior exam, and most consistent with atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There
 is no pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, normal appearance
 of the mediastinal contours.
