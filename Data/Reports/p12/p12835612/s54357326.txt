                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. A linear opacity extending from the
 right upper hilum may represent focal mucous impaction. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  A linear opacity extending from the right upper hilum may
 represent focal mucous impaction. While this does not explain the patient's
 chest discomfort, it may reflect the sequela of underlying small airways
 disease such as asthma. If clinically warranted, additional shallow and full
 left oblique views could be obtained to further assess this area. 
 
 The updated findings were emailed to the ___ nursing staff by Dr. ___ on ___ for followup with this patient's primary care practice.
