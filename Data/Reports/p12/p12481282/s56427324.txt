                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 3+ pedal edema  // ?chf
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Bilateral upper lobe volume loss is present with
 elevation of the hila. Nonspecific pleural parenchymal scarring is present at
 both lung apices, and note is made of a larger asymmetrical opacity in the
 right upper lobe below the level of the medial right clavicle measuring 2.4 cm
 in diameter. This is difficult to confirm on the lateral view, but a project
 posterior to the trachea partially overlying the aortic arch contour.  Lungs
 are hyperexpanded. Asymmetrical opacity in the left lower lung probably
 represents asymmetry of the breasts contour on this side. There is no pleural
 effusion. Bones are diffusely demineralized and note is made of scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2.4 cm right upper lobe nodular opacity, for which chest CT may be helpful for
 further characterization, in order to differentiate a malignant pulmonary lung
 nodule from a benign process.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 16:23 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
