                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result, appearing mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
