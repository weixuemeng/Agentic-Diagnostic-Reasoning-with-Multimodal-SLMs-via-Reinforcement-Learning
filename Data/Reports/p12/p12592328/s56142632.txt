                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Port-A-Cath remains in
 place.  Nasogastric tube has been removed.  Extremely severe changes in the
 thoracic and lumbar spine are again appreciated.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  There is mild prominence of pulmonary
 vessels, though it is unclear whether this represents vascular congestion or
 merely crowding of vessels related to the poor inspiration.
