                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  A these she is is history is she and she is a can of is the disc
 is is I a.m. 8 cm caps is a is be see is a superior the it
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___. 
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top-normal.  Intrathoracic lymph node enlargement in subtle
 interstitial lung abnormalities are consistent with patient's known
 sarcoidosis.  There is new increased diffuse opacity overlying the left lung,
 with tenting of the diaphragm, consistent with left upper lobe collapse.  On
 the lateral view, there is an opacity anteriorly, with anterior displacement
 of the oblique fissure, also consistent with left upper lobe collapse.  There
 is no large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New left upper lobe collapse.  This could be secondary to acute airway
 obstruction due to mucous plugging, clotted blood products,foreign body
 aspiration, or granulation tissue if the patient has sustained bronchial
 injury.  A chest CT or bronchoscopy is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 2.  Intrathoracic lymph node enlargement and subtle interstitial lung
 abnormalities, consistent patient's known sarcoidosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at
 06:40 on the day of the exam, approximately ___ min after discovery.
