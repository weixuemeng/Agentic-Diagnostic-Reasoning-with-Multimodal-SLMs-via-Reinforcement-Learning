                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and fever status post recent
 bronchoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta remains unfolded.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar with previously noted elevated left hilus appearing
 improved.  Known mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is better
 appreciated on the recent chest CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases as well as linear opacity
 in the left upper lung field likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases as well as left upper lobe. Known
 mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is better seen on the previous
 chest CT.
