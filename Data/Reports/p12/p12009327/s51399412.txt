                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and hemoptysis, evaluate
 for pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Relatively high positioned diaphragms indicative of poor
 inspirational effort causing some crowded appearance of the basal pulmonary
 vasculature.  The heart size is within normal limits and no configurational
 abnormality is seen.  Unremarkable appearance of the aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of any acute parenchymal
 infiltrate.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits.  When comparison is
 made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, findings are
 unchanged.  Already on the preceding examination, a poor inspirational effort
 was noted with similar crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature, but
 absence of any acute infiltrate.  Comparison shows that the patient. during
 today's examination, was able to accomplish some deeper inspirational effort.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infiltrate or CHF in this ___-year-old female
 patient with history of cough and hemoptysis.
