 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with subcarinal fiducial placement. 
 Evaluation for pneumothorax and position of fiducial marker.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new fiducial marker

 pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low and there is some plate-like
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  No evidence of focal pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  The previously seen right-sided port is unchanged in standard
 position.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Fiducial marker in place below the level of the carina.  No
 pneumothorax.
