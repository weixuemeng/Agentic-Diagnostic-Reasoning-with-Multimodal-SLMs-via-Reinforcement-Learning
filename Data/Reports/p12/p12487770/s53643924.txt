                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and pulmonary embolism. 
 Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Unchanged presence of a right pectoral Port-A-Cath.  Unchanged low
 lung volumes and mild cardiomegaly.  Parenchymal opacity in both lower lobes,
 already visible on the CT examination from ___, appear to have
 increased.  They are now well appreciated on the lateral radiograph.  In
 addition, a relatively important right basal plate-like atelectasis is seen.
 
 No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The increasing extent of the pre-existing bilateral basal
 opacities, as compared to the CT examination from ___ could suggest
 the presence of infectious lung changes.
