 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent esophageal tear.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is present. 
 Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are now unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of pleural effusions in either
 lateral or posterior pleural sinuses and no pneumothorax in the apical area. 
 Comparison is made with several preceding chest examinations as well as review
 of two CTs is performed.  Apparently, the patient had a perforation of the
 lower esophagus with air in the mediastinal structures.  All these
 abnormalities have now normalized and no remaining pulmonary, cardiovascular
 or pleural abnormality remains.
