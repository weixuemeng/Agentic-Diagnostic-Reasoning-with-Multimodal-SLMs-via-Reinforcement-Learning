                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with question of Boerhaave syndrome,
 pneumomediastinum and gastric emphysema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Trace pneumopericardium is present.  Faint lucencies
 persist in the region of the gastroesophageal junction, likely representing
 residual pneumomediastinum, and better appreciated on prior CT.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle, corresponding to focal
 atelectasis on CT.  Left lung is clear.  Hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Trace residual pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium.
 2.  Right lower lobe atelectasis.
