                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left basal ganglia stroke, presenting with right leg weakness and
 falls.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta is similar to somewhat
 increased over the long interval, although it may be exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  The heart is normal in size.  There is also new mild relative
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right side.  However, the
 lungs appear clear, and there is no evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes along the thoracic spine are mild and not
 significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or injury.
