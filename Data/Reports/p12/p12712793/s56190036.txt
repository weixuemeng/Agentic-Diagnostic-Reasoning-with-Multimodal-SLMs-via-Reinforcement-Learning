                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of lung cancer, congestive heart
 failure, and hypertension, now with unsteady gait and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected.  Hyperinflated lungs with underlying
 emphysematous changes appear similar compared to prior.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours appear stable with calcified tortuous aorta.  Lung nodules seen on
 prior CT are not appreciated radiographically, but CT is more sensitive for
 small lung nodules. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for acute change.
