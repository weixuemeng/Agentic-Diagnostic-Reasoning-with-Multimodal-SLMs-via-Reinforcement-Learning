                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer status post fall with right rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ as well as chest radiograph from ___ FINDINGS
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Reticular opacity at the right costophrenic angle, may in part be chronic, but
 underlying consolidation at this site is not excluded.  The pulmonary nodules
 seen on CT are better appreciated on CT as CT is more sensitive.  Rounded
 opacity projecting in the midline at the level of the diaphragm is consistent
 with patient's ectatic aorta.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable with the cardiac silhouette top-normal and the aortic calcified and
 tortuous. No definite rib fracture is seen.  However, if rib fracture remains
 of high clinical concern, consider dedicated rib series.
