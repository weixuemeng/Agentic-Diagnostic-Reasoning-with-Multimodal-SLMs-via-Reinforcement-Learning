                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Transfusion reaction.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Increased interstitial markings at the lung
 bases are relatively stable consistent with chronic changes.  The aorta
 remains markedly tortuous with known aneurysm.  No evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change, chronic changes, as above.
