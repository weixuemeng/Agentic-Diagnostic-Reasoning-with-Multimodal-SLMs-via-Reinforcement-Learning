                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of pneumonia presenting with fever and
 cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is a retrocardiac left
 lower lobe opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which projects
 over the lower spine on the lateral view consistent with left lower lobe
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities
 at the right lung base are likely atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable including a tortuous aorta.  The bones are intact.  The
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation most consistent with pneumonia.
