                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left retrocardiac opacity present since ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Left retrocardiac opacity
 continues to improve, but has not resolved.  Nodular density overlying the
 anterior right 2nd rib is not seen on priors.  Tracheomegaly is again noted. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent retrocardiac opacity slowly improving over the course
 of three months may represent  scarring.  Also, questionable nodular density
 in the right upper lobe may artifactual considering it appeared over the
 course of 4 weeks.  Further charachterization of these findings with CT is
 reasonable.
 
 Findings were submitted to the radiology communications dashboard.
