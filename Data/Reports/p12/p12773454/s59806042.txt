                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with partially resolved pneumonia on chest x-ray
 from ___.  Evaluate for resolution.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Continued improvement of the left lateral retrocardiac opacity without
 resolution.  Residual opacity is associated with bronchial wall thickening and
 questionable bronchial dilation. No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or
 focal consolidation is seen, and the cardiac silhouette are normal. 
 Tracheomegaly measuring approximately 3.5 cm is seen at the proximal trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Further improvement in left lower lobe opacity without complete resolution. 
 Recommend a repeat chest x-ray in approximately 4 weeks to ensure complete
 clearance.
