                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presents with headaches and blurry vision.  Found to have a 6-mm
 suprasellar mass on CT.  Status post exploratory craniotomy for tumor.  Assess
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON: ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates placement of
 endotracheal tube terminating at the level of the carina and should be
 withdrawn at least 3 cm to terminate at the level of the clavicle. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Bibasilar
 opacifications, left greater than right, may represent atelectasis, though
 infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina and
 should be withdrawn 3 cm.  Bibasilar opacifications, atelectasis versus
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
