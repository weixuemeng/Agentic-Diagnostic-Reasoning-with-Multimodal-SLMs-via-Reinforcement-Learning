 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cirrhosis and new
 renal failure, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy

 could be due to underlying infection, atelectasis, or aspiration.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable retrocardiac opacity seen in the lateral view, not
 substantiated on the frontal view, could be due to overlapping structures,
 atelectasis; however, consolidation from infection or aspiration not excluded.
