 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:12 PM
  Endotracheal tube just above carina. Retracting an additional 2 cm
  recommended. Increased pulmonary opacities, most likely edema, which could be
  exaggerated by lower lung volumes or could represent worsening edema.
  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 9:10 p.m. on ___ at time of

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate reposition of ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier.
 
 ET tube tip is just above the carina and could be withdrawn 1-2 cm for more
 standard position.  Mild pulmonary edema has worsened.  NG tube has been
 removed.  The stomach is very distended.  Left IJ catheter tip remains in the
 mid SVC.
