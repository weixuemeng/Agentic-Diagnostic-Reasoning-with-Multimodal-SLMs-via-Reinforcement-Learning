                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Unavailable
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs and
 flattening of bilateral diaphragm most consistent with emphysematous changes. 
 Heart size is slightly enlarged.  There is no evidence of hilar adenopathy. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  Opacities which project over the right
 lower lung zone are suspicious for an infectious process.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural parenchymal
 scarring is mild.  Osseous structures and imaged upper abdomen are without an
 acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities project over the right lower lung zone worrisome for infectious
 process.
 
 Emphysematous changes
