 Right chest tube remains in place.  There is some lucency along the right
 medial heart border and cardiophrenic angle which could represent loculated
 air.  No definite apical component is seen.  Linear opacity at the right base
 likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  The left lung is grossly clear. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a small amount
 of subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall.  Bullet fragments
 are seen in the right axillary soft tissues.
