 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Aortic knob calcifications are re-
 demonstrated.  Widening of the mediastinal contour at the level of the
 vascular pedicle is re- demonstrated compatible with elevated central venous
 pressures.  There is also mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated.  Patchy opacification within the
 left lung base may reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There
 are moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis.
