                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of cardiac silhouette which
 appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, possibly reflective of
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Small left
 pleural effusion may be present.  No right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified, though assessment of the right apex is somewhat
 limited due to the patient's chin obscuring this region.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Possible trace left
 pleural effusion.
