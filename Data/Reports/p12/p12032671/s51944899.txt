 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  There has
 been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Advancement by 8-10 cm would be recommended to
 place the tube within the stomach.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  Patchy opacities at both bases more likely reflect atelectasis in
 the setting of lower volumes although aspiration or pneumonia should also be
 considered.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on ___ at ___:24 at the time of discovery.  He stated that the team is aware
 and that the tube has been already advanced.
