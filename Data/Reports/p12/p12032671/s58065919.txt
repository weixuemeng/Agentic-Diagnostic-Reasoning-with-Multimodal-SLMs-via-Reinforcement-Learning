                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L PICC malpositioned  // L PICC retracted
 1cm and ___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Although the appearance of the left-sided PICC line has improved, it remains
 angled at its tip.  Given its location, this could indicate that it extends
 into the azygos vein and should therefore be repositioned.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Otherwise, no significant changes identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Abnormal appearance to the distal tip of the left-sided PICC line. 
 Repositioning is recommended.
