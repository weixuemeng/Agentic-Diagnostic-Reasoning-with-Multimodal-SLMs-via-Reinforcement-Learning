 explained by pneumonia. Mild edema has also developed, best appreciated in the
 left lung. . A second focus of pneumonia could be in the left lower lobe
 partially obscured by cardiac silhouette. Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are presumed.  No pneumothorax. Heart is top-normal size. Upper enteric
 drainage tube passes least as far as the distal portion of the nondistended
 stomach.
