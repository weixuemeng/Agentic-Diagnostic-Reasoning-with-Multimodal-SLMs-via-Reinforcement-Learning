                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating 4.6 cm above the carina and nasogastric tube terminating within
 the stomach.  Lung volumes are slightly low, with mild prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild vascular
 congestion. Patchy left suprahilar opacity could reflect asymmetrical edema or
 secondary process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, of unclear chronicity. The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard the.
 2. Mild vascular congestion.   Patchy left suprahilar opacity as described,
 for which attention on short-term followup radiographs is suggested.
 
 3. Elevation left hemidiaphragm of uncertain chronicity
