                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent MRSA PNA, aspiration.  Dobhoff
 placement.  // evaluate for Dobhoff placement      evaluate for Dobhoff
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of a
 Dobhoff tube that extends to the distal stomach.  Nasogastric tube is been
 removed.  Central catheter is unchanged.
 Low lung volumes with increased opacification at the right base most likely
 consistent with pleural effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
 The suggested area of increased opacification at the left base on the previous
 study has effectively cleared.
