                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with interstitial pulmonary
 edema after trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval progression of vascular engorgement,
 which is difficult to assess given the bilateral large pleural effusions which
 are layering and obscuring the lungs.  Bibasilar consolidations are unchanged
 as well as the cardiomediastinal silhouette and the position of the tubes and
 lines.
