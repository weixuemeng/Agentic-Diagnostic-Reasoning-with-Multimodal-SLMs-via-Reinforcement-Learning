                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post trauma and multiple injuries, C-spine fracture,
 evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One semi-erect portable AP view of the chest.  ET tube ends 4.4 cm
 from the carina.  Persistent bibasilar opacities, right greater the left. 
 Pulmonary edema has slightly improved and there has been interval decrease in
 bilateral small pleural effusions.  However, persistent bilateral parenchymal
 opacities may represent multifocal pneumonia or less likely ARDS.  Cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The left subclavian central
 venous catheter ends in the right atrium.  An enteric tube ends in the
 duodenum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema and pleural effusions;
 however, persistent parenchymal opacities may represent either multifocal
 pneumonia or less likely ARDS.
