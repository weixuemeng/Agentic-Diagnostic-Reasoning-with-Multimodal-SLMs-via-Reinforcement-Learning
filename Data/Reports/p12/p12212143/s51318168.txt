                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient intubated status post BAL.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 position.  Right lower lobe opacity has increased, likely due to recent BAL. 
 Diffuse left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are unchanged.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
