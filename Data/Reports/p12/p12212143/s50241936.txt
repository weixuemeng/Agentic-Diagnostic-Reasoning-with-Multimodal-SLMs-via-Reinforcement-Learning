                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia after an MVC.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube seats 3.5-4 cm above the carina.  A
 left-sided central line tip is within the upper right atrium/lower cavoatrial
 junction.  An endogastric feeding tube demonstrates its tip sitting in the
 distal portion of the stomach/early portion of the duodenum.  Four metallic
 coil/clip densities project over the expected region of the stomach.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar opacities persist, more
 extensive on the right than the left, and progressed from prior studies.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is present.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small, also persist.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, with mild
 pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
