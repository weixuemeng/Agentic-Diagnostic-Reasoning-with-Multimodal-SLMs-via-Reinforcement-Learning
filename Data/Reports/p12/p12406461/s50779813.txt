                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with gastroparesis status post NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates enteric feeding tube
 with distal tip in the mid-to-low esophagus, above the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  A right-sided chest port
 remains in standard position.  The previously seen gaseous distention of the
 stomach is improved.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Enteric feeding tube lies with distal tip in the mid-to-lower
 esophagus, above the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  The tube would
 need to be advanced 15 cm in order for all side ports to be below the GE
 junction.  Lungs remain clear.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 10:20, 5 minutes after the discovery was made.
