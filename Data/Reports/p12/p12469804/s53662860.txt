                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, loculated left pleural effusion
 s/p chest tube placement x2, now CT clogged.  // Please evaluate for interval
 change in L pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, left pigtail pleural
 catheter has slightly changed in position, and a adjacent left chest tube also
 remains in place.  Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent left lower
 lobe atelectasis persists with no visible pneumothorax.  Overall appearance of
 the chest is unchanged allowing for lower lung volumes on today's exam.
