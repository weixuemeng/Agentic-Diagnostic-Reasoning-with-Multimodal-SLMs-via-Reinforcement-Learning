                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rales, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph performed earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacities in the lung bases appear slightly progressed when compared to the
 prior study.  This could reflect atelectasis as a result of slightly reduced
 lung volumes compared to the prior study.  Additionally, more focal patchy
 opacity in the right lung base again may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 infection.  There are continued small bilateral pleural effusions as well as a
 loculated right apicolateral pleural effusion.  Remainder of the exam is
 unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy, CABG, pacemaker placement, and left axillary
 lymph node dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly decreased lung volumes compared to the prior study with patchy
 ill-defined bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  More
 focal opacity in the right lung base could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema
 or infection.  Remainder of the exam is unchanged.
