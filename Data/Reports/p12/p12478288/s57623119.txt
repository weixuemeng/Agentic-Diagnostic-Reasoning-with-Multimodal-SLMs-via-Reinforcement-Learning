                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Back pain, undergoing treatment for breast pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy CABG.  Right-sided dual chamber
 pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, unchanged.  There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly which is stable.
 The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted with fluid identified within the fissures. Smoothly
 lobulated opacity overlying the right apex is compatible with a loculated
 pleural effusion which has slightly increased when compared to the prior
 study.  Ill-defined streaky opacity within the right lung base appears
 slightly worsened in the interval, which could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema though infection in the right lung base is not completely excluded.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures with compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine again
 demonstrated.  Clips in the left axilla are again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with slight interval increase in loculated
 pleural fluid about the right lung apex.  Patchy opacity within the right lung
 base may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection cannot be
 excluded.
