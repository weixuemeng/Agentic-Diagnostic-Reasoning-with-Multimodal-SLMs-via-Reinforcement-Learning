                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of kyphoscoliosis and heart
 failure, who presents with hypoxemia, assess worsening right upper anterior
 loculated pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead
 pacemaker is unchanged with pacer pack residing in the chest wall and lead tip
 residing in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Midline sternotomy wires and changes from prior CABG again noted.  The patient
 is kyphotically positioned, limiting evaluation.  Scoliotic deformity is again
 seen.  Increased vague opacity in the upper lungs is increased from prior exam
 and likely reflects loculated pleural collections as seen on the lateral view.
 There is also mild interstitial edema with cardiomegaly again seen.  Clips are
 noted in the left axilla.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased density in the upper lungs bilaterally likely represent
 increasing loculated pleural collections/pseudotumor.  Mild interstitial edema
 is redemonstrated.  Given that the patient is symptomatic, consider CT to
 better assess and to guide decision making for possible intervention.
