                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Reportedly, a recent pneumonia seen on radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There is increased volume loss in the right upper lung with a similar right
 lateral pleural thickening.  The overall appearance suggests a loculated
 pleural effusion in the right hemithorax.  Likewise, there is a persistent
 lenticular collection along the left upper hemithorax as well as thickening
 along fissures.  This is again most likely to represent a loculated pleural
 effusion.  
 
 Compared to the prior study, more dense opacification is suspected in the left
 lower lobe within the retrocardiac region that may reflect a superimposed
 process, although, aside from the fact that it is new since ___, acuity
 is uncertain.  Considerable background opacification appears fairly chronic
 within both lungs bilaterally.  There are also increasing, but small
 free-flowing components of pleural effusion suspected bilaterally based on the
 lateral view.  
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft
 surgery.  A pacemaker/ICD device with two leads appears unchanged with leads
 again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle.  
 
 The bones appear demineralized with multiple similar compression deformities
 and bony demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacities largely reflecting, most likely loculated
 pleural effusions.  Background reticulation at the lung base is suspicious for
 pulmonary fibrosis.  Focal increased opacification is noted in the left lower
 lobe, possibly pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although other
 etiologies including worsening interstitial lung disease could be considered.
