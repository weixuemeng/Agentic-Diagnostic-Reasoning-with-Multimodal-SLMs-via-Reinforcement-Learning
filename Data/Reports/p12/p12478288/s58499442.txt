                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary bypass
 surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits.  Smoothly marginated right-sided lateral
 pleural opacification is again demonstrated, and has slightly decreased in
 extent apicolaterally.  On the lateral radiograph, pleural opacity, presumably
 fluid is also present within the fissures on the lateral view.  Within the
 right lung, heterogeneous opacities are present throughout the right lower
 lobe, projecting over the thoracic spine on the lateral view.  A previously
 present opacity in the right upper lung has resolved.
 
 Bones are diffusely demineralized, and compression deformities are again
 visualized in the mid thoracic spine. Permanent pacemaker in standard
 position. Previous left axillary lymph node dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight decrease in extent of right-sided pleural opacity, presumably
 representing loculated pleural fluid, although a component of chronic pleural
 thickening is also possible
 
 2.  Clearing of right upper lobe opacity, but persistent opacities in the
 right lower lobe.  Findings could potentially be due to an aspiration
 pneumonia given clinical suspicion for pneumonia.
