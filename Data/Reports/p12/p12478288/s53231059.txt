                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with aspiration, contrast-induced
 nephropathy, worsening infiltrate following two aspirations?
 
 FINDINGS:  The request for PA and lateral chest examination had to be altered
 because of patient's limited clinical condition.  She was examined in sitting
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding portable AP single view chest examination dated ___.  Previously described findings of sternotomy, bypass surgery, and
 right-sided permanent pacer with dual intracavitary electrode system are
 unchanged.  The degree of cardiac enlargement also appears unaltered. 
 Comparison however, demonstrates that the previously identified marked
 pulmonary congestive pattern with peripheral perivascular haze in both lungs
 and bases has improved significantly.  There is still some mild degree of
 blunting in the lateral pleural sinuses as well as the previously described
 thickening of the right-sided apical pleura.  The lateral view also discloses
 the presence of thickening of the interlobar fissures, most likely related to
 pleural effusions related to chronic CHF.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new pulmonary abnormalities in this patient with evidence of
 previous cardiac enlargement.  Comparison with the next preceding chest
 examination demonstrates marked improvement of the congestive pattern in the
 pulmonary vasculature which was present on ___.
