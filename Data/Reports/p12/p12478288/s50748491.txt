                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Flank pain and crackles at the bases; history of congestive heart
 failure and coronary disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads again terminating
 in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  Surgical clips are also
 again present in the left axilla.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including stable widening of
 the right upper mediastinal contour.  An area of right apical pleural
 thickening is improved suggesting continued decrease in a suspected loculated
 pleural effusion, although patchy right mid lung opacities and pleural
 thickening appear unchanged.  Fissures remained thickened.  Overall, since
 ___, however, there is less opacification in the right lung.  The left
 lung remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized
 with similar multilevel compression deformities along the mid to lower
 thoracic spine, which are incompletely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight continued interval improvement in the right lung
 opacification and decrease in right apical pleural thickening suggestive of
 improvement in a loculated pleural effusion.  Thickening of fissures,
 suggestive of persistent mild fluid overload.  Bony demineralization and
 compression deformities, not significantly changed including moderate
 rightward convex curvature.
