 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, evaluation for effusion and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally
 increased opacity at the left lateral lung bases, likely atelectatic in
 origin.  The known bilateral subpleural opacities along with pre-existing rib
 changes, are constant in extent and severity.  Also constant in extent is a
 known right apical area of severe pleural thickening.
 
 The lung volumes remain low.  There is status post CABG, moderate size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Right pectoral pacemaker, clips after left axillary lymph
 node resection.
