                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Systolic heart failure, evaluation for exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have improved, but mild pulmonary edema is still clearly
 visible.  The lung volumes are low.  Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are
 present, and better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal film. 
 Basal atelectasis at the lung bases.  Focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.
