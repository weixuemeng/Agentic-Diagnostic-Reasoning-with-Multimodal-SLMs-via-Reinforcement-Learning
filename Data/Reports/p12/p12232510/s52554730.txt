                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of CHF and dyspnea  // Any evidence of
 volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Mild upper zone vascular redistribution
 suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
