                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and indistinctness of the hila is
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion.  Trace left pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary edema with possible small right pleural effusion.  Right basilar
 opacity may be due to combination of pulmonary edema and right pleural
 effusion/atelectasis, however, underlying infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Consider repeat after diuresis.
