  The PICC line is in stable position.  Mild pulmonary edema is minimally
  improved.  There is less central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Atelectasis
  is worse at the right base and stable at the left base.  There is no large
  pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
  is stable with mild cardiomegaly.

 for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.

 Lung volumes are lower with increasing atelectasis in the right base.  There
 is no pneumothorax or effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema has increased.
