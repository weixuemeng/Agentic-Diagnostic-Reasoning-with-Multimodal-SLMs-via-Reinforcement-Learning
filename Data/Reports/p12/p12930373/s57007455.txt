                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and spinal fusion surgery on ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular markings.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Patchy perihilar opacities and indistinct pulmonary vascular
 markings are compatible with pulmonary edema.  No definite focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized.  The osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  A lower thoracic spine posterior fusion
 construct with pedicle screws and vertical fusion rods is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy perihilar opacities and indistinct pulmonary vasculature,
 compatible with pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Incompletely imaged thoracic spine fusion hardware.
