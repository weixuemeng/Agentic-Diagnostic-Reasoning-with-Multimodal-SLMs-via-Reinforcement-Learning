                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 possible CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since condition required examination in sitting semi-upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Analysis is performed in
 direct comparison with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of
 ___.  The patient is very heavy, a fact which detracts from the
 ability to assess pulmonary vasculature with confidence.  Comparison is made
 with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of ___.
 The patient is status post orthopedic stabilization of the lower thoracic and
 lumbar spine ___ rods identified.  Relatively high positioned diaphragms
 result in crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the bases.  Heart
 size is difficult to assess but probably mildly enlarged with a configuration
 favoring the left ventricle with prominence to the left and posteriorly.  No
 significant left atrial enlargement can be identified.  No new discrete
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  Comparison to the pulmonary
 vasculature suggests a somewhat increased upper zone redistribution pattern
 with more distended pulmonary veins in the upper zone area.  There is,
 however, no conclusive evidence for any new pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased upper zone redistribution pattern may match clinical
 findings of shortness of breath.  Radiographic interpretation of vascular
 pattern difficult in this very adipose patient.  No pneumothorax is seen.
