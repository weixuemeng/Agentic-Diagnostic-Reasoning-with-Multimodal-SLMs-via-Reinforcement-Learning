                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker leads are noted within the right atrium, right ventricle, and
 region of the coronary sinus.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated, unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta also noted. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which appears chronic.  A hazy
 opacity within the right lung base is not clearly identified on the lateral
 view, and may be partly due to overlying soft tissue, but an area of
 atelectasis or infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are multiple old right-sided rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy right basilar opacity seen only on the frontal view may reflect overlying
 soft tissue as there is no correlate on the lateral view, though atelectasis
 or infection is not completely excluded.  Mild chronic pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
