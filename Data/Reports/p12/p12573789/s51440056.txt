 WET READ: ___ ___ ___:___ PM
  
   
  
  1. Right basilar opacity seen only on the frontal view may reflect a
  combination of overlying soft tissue, atelectasis and pulmonary edema. However
  an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded and a followup
  chest radiograph is recommended after diuresis.
  
  2. Moderate cardiomegaly and interstitial pulmonary edema.

 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___:___ PM
  
   
  
  1. Increased density at the right lung base appears more conspicuous than on
  prior examinations and is best seen in the frontal view, raises concern for
  infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting.
  
  2. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CAD, CHF presents w/ weight gain, worsening
 dyspnea  // ? pulmonary congestion, PNA      ? pulmonary congestion, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, including most recent from ___ as well as prior chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium, right
 ventricle and coronary sinus remain in unchanged position. The heart remains
 moderately enlarged.  Increased density at the right lung base is not clearly
 identified on the lateral view and may be partially due to overlying soft
 tissue, pulmonary edema and atelectasis. However an underlying infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded. There is a there is mild to moderate
 interstitial pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly and interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Hazy opacity in right lower lung is at least partially accounted for by
 right chest wall deformity related to old injury. If clinical suspicion for
 infectious pneumonia persists, short-term followup radiograph may be helpful
 to exclude superimposed pulmonary infection in this region.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 4:___ PM.
