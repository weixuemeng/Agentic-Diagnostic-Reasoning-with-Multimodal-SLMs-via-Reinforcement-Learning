                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and cough  // R/o pneumonia      R/o
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with triple-lumen pacer device in place.
 There is again increased opacification at the right base that is difficult to
 identify on the lateral view and could well represent a combination of chest
 wall deformity related to old injury and atelectatic changes.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in this region.
