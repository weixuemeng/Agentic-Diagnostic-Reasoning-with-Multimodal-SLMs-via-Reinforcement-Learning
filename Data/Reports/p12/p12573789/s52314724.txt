  1. Progression of severe pulmonary edema with persistent moderate cardiomegaly
  and new small left pleural effusion with likely small right pleural effusion.
  2. Heterogeneous right upper lobe opacity may represent asymmetric pulmonary
  edema however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
  setting.

  cardiomegaly and new small left pleural effusion with likely small right
  pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea.  Assess volume status.
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact median
 sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, left chest wall defibrillator with wire
 tips in the right atrium, right ventricle, and likely coronary sinus.  A new
 endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with tip 6 cm above the level of
 the carina.
 
 Bilateral heterogeneous opacities have increased over last 4 hours, with
 asymmetric involvement of the right hemi thorax with an upper lobe
 predominance.  New small left pleural effusion with likely small right pleural
 effusion is present.  No pneumothorax.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.
 Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Chronic rib cage deformity along right lateral fifth rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Progression of severe pulmonary edema with persistent moderate cardiomegaly
 and new small left pleural effusion with likely small right pleural effusion.
 2. Heterogeneous right upper lobe opacity may represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
