                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, shortness of breath, rule out effusion or volume overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:28 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior study, there are very pronounced new miliary or
 micronodular opacities at both right and left bases.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF, possibly slightly more pronounced than on
 the prior film.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  Possible tiny
 bilateral effusions.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film, with stable
 mild cardiomegaly.  The hila, which have a relatively tapered appearance, may
 be slightly more prominent.  Probable background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 2.  Probable background COPD.
 
 3.  Compared with ___, there is now a very pronounced
 micronodular/miliary pattern at both lung bases.  This pattern is quite
 distinctive and could reflect the presence of TB or other granulomatous
 processes or possibly a viral pneumonia. Pneumoconioses can also give rise to
 this appearance, but would not be expected to develop so quickly.
 
 4.  Possible small bilateral effusions.
