                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with craniotomy  // NGT placement      NGT
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A in comparison with the study ___, the patient has taken a poor
 inspiration. Endotracheal tube extends up to about 5.4 cm above the Carina. 
 Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach before crossing the lower
 margin of the image.  The apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could
 in part be due to the low lung volumes and the AP portable rather than upright
 PA position of the patient. Nevertheless, there is evidence of increasing
 pulmonary vascular congestion. . Opacification running horizontally in the mid
 right lung could reflect either atelectasis or fluid within the minor fissure.
