                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, hypoxia  // acute cardiopulm disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are somewhat low. Diffuse opacity is seen in the bilateral
 lungs, predominantly in the bases, with a predominantly alveolar
 configuration. This pattern is most consistent with aspiration. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral alveolar opacities, predominantly in the lung bases, most consistent
 with aspiration.
