 AP CHEST, 2:23 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia, following extubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Though there is some greater opacification at the base of the right lung
 compared to the remainder, following extubation this area improved, making it
 unlikely to be pneumonia, more likely asymmetric pulmonary edema, which has
 improved generally.  The heart is normal size.  Pleural effusion is small if
 any.  Right jugular line ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate
 gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach persists following removal of the
 feeding tube.
