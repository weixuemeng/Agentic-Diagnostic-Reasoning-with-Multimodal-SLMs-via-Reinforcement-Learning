                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent stroke, has acute dyspnea,
 evaluate for acute process such as aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS: AP single view, the patient in semi-upright position is compared
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  During the
 interval, the patient has been extubated.  Left-sided internal jugular
 approach wide-caliber line remains in unchanged position and the same holds
 for the right internal jugular small-caliber central venous line.  Both lines
 terminate in the lower SVC.  No pneumothorax has developed.  There are no new
 discrete parenchymal densities seen on this portable chest examination in
 comparison with the previous study.  Hazy diffuse densities over the bases
 have more the appearance of pleural effusion layering in the posterior pleural
 space as the patient is markedly reclined.  Review of older chest examinations
 reveals that the patient had evidence of at least left-sided pleural effusion
 on previous examination of ___.  More conclusive documentation of
 pleural effusion could be obtained with a lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No conclusive evidence for new pulmonary pathology such as
 aspiration.
