 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatic cancer, cholangitis, intubation, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The nasogastric tube remains in place.  The obviously pre-existing
 small right pleural effusion appears slightly more extensive than on the
 previous image, in part due to rotational component.  Newly appeared mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis but no extensive left pleural effusion.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
