 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, unchanged.  The heart size is mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There are streaky opacities in the lung bases, with mild
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggestive of a small pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Clips are noted within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflecting areas of
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion.
