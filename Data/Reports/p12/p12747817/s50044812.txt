                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is
 noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There are
 perihilar hazy opacities with vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases may reflect compressive
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.  There are likely
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  Clips in the
 right upper quadrant denote prior cholecystectomy. A stent is imaged within
 the right/mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar patchy opacities, possibly atelectasis, though infection
 is not completely excluded.
