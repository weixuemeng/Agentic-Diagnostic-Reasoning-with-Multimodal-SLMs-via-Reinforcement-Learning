                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis with right basilar opacity, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some continued
 opacification at the right base that could reflect pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  The left base shows
 mild atelectasis and effusion that is improved since the previous study. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 still mildly engorged, though less than on the previous study.  Pacer device
 remains in place.
