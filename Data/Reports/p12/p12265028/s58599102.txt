                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RLL pneumonia with consolidation  // follow
 up
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes bilaterally.  Bibasilar opacities which may represent
 pulmonary edema are improved.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. Apparent cardiomegaly may be an artifact of narrow AP
 chest diameter with abundant mediastinal fat. Stable mediastinal widening due
 to vascular engorgement.  Left chest port with tip in the right atrium. 
 Bilateral pleural fat again demonstrated, better seen on previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are improved.  No current evidence of pneumonia.
 
 Low lung volumes bilaterally. Stable mediastinal widening due to vascular
 engorgement.
