                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study ___ ___, some respiratory motion
 degrades the image.  There is enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 with left basilar opacification that has decreased since the previous study. 
 The left hemidiaphragm is now quite sharply seen.  The degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion appears to have decreased.  The central catheter tip is
 difficult to see, but appears to be in the mid-to-lower SVC.
 
 There are several areas of lucencies with relatively sharp margins projected
 over the mediastinum.  This could well represent artifact.  If there is any
 possibility of mediastinal gas, repeat study with improved technique would be
 recommended.
