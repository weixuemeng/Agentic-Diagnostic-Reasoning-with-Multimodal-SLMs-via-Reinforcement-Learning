                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Friedriechs ataxia, recurrent aspiration
 pna. s/P intubation  // Evaluate ETT placement.     Evaluate ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ at
 5:16 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New endotracheal tube is in standard position.  New nasogastric tube ends in
 the upper stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the
 side ports into the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes are lower, despite intubation and moderately severe pulmonary
 edema has worsened.  Greater consolidation has been consistently present at
 the base of the left long, either atelectasis or pneumonia.  Small to moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions may have increased since earlier in the day,
 although the volume is exaggerated by low lung volumes.
 
 Left subclavian infusion port ends in the right atrium, as before.  No
 pneumothorax.
