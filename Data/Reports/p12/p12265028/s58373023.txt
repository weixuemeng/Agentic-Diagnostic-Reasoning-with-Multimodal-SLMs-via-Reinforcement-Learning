                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent aspiration pneumonia // Evaluate
 for interval change in infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube ends at the level of the clavicles. Accessed left pectoral MediPort
 terminates in the right atrium. Nasogastric tube courses below the
 hemidiaphragm, tip not visualized. Lung volumes are low. Moderate bilateral
 layering pleural effusions are unchanged. An airspace opacity at the right
 lung base has increased.  Increased retrocardiac airspace opacification with
 air bronchograms may also be due to aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bibasilar airspace opacities are likely due to evolving aspiration
 or pneumonia.
 Stable moderate layering pleural effusions.
