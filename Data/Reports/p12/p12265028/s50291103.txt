                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph described in the history from___ on
 ___ is not available for comparison, but comparison is made to a
 recent chest CT of ___.
 
 The patient has a markedly narrow AP diameter of the chest, which results in
 compression of cardiomediastinal structures.  Combined with prominent
 mediastinal fat (mediastinal lipomatosis), this accounts for the apparent
 widening of the cardiomediastinal contour on the chest radiograph.  The right
 lung is clear.  Within the left hemithorax, there is generalized increased
 opacity in the left mid lung region with associated obscuration of the
 majority of the left heart border, concerning for consolidation in the
 lingula, not definitively confirmed on the lateral view.  No definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  Left subclavian Port-A-Catheter is in
 place with tip terminating in the region of the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for lingular pneumonia.  Direct comparison to
 outside chest x-ray from___ would be helpful if available to assess
 for interval change.  Recommend followup chest x-ray in four weeks to document
 resolution.
