                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fever, cough, please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Markedly narrow AP diameter of the chest, with resultant
 compression of the cardiomediastinal structures combined with prominent
 mediastinal fat (mediastinal lipomatosis) accounts for the apparent widening
 of the cardiomediastinal contour on the chest radiograph, overall similar to
 the prior exams dated back to ___.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
 There is no evidence of a pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  Left subclavian Port-A-Cath
 appears to be in place with the tip terminating in the region of the right
 atrium. Note is made of fiducial markers at the site of the patient's known
 liver metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal contours with mild bibasilar
 atelectasis, left greater than right, is overall unchanged compared to the
 prior radiograph from ___, and may be the patient's baseline
 appearance.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
