                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:21 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after a robotic Whipple procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs fully expanded and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces.  Upper enteric drainage tube would need to
 be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.  No
 pneumothorax, appreciable pleural effusion, or even pneumoperitoneum, although
 there is subcutaneous emphysema in both flanks, presumably the result of the
 recent surgery.
