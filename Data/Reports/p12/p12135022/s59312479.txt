                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib fractures and bacteremia.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.7 cm
 above the level of the carina.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of
 the diaphragm and out of the field-of-view inferiorly, not significantly
 changed.  A right PICC ends in the upper SVC, as before.  Lung volumes are
 very low, decreased compared to the prior study from ___.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is not significantly changed.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion, as before.  New widening of the vascular pedicle is likely
 secondary to venous engorgement.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not significant changed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis, not significantly changed.
 
 2.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Increased engorgement of superior mediastinal veins.
 
 4.  Unchanged mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
