                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lung clear except for
 questionable rounded opacity projecting over the anterior end of the first
 right rib, 8 mm in diameter.  It can be seen, but smaller in dimension on the
 prior studies.  Most likely it represents costochondral junction of the first
 rib, but evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
 
 The patient is after cholecystectomy.
