                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left pleuritic chest pain for one day in a patient
 with birth control pills.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 There is indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm with no definitive
 consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  The finding might represent
 developing/resolving infection . On the other hand, pulmonary infarct cannot
 be excluded and if clinically warranted, evaluation of the patient with CT
 angiography of the chest is required.
