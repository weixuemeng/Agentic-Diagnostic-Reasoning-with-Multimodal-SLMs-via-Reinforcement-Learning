                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:39.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia, question CHF.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 12:23.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 12:39 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is an opacity overlying the right medial heart
 border and projecting posteriorly over the spine which when correlated with
 the CT of ___ corresponds to osteophytic changes.  No airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Marked degenerative changes in the spine as well as involving the right
 acromioclavicular joint.  Probable rotator cuff tear involving the right
 shoulder given the narrowed acromiohumeral distance on this image.
