                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:14 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after cardiac arrest.  Assess ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, most recently 11:52 p.m.:
 
 The diaphragmatic region is excluded from the examination.  All other left
 pleural surfaces point to decreasing if not entirely resolved left
 pneumothorax, but possible increase in moderate left pleural effusion.  There
 has also been a progressive increase in the opacification of the left lower
 lobe, either contusion, atelectasis, or early pneumonia.  Rib fractures are
 difficult to discern because of all of the overlying pleural margins, but I
 think there are fractures in the left fifth and sixth ribs anteriorly
 
 Mild atelectasis is developing at the right lung base.  ET tube is in standard
 placement, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Right
 internal jugular line ends low in the SVC.
