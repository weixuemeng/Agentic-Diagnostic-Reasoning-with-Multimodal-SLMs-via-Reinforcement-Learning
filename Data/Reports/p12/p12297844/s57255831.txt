                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post- cardiac arrest intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is in position in the mid trachea.  Enteric tube traverses
 to the stomach.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, left greater than
 right, suggestive of mild to moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.  A few
 opacities are noted on the left and likely atelectatic/contusions. 
 Additionally, there may be a very small left pneumothorax.  There is
 irregularity of the left lateral fifth rib and the right lateral second rib,
 partially evaluated, which may represent rib fractures.  No right-sided
 pneumothorax. Right subcutaneous tissue air is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax is likely present.  Right subcutaneous
 tissue air is noted. Continued followup is recommended. 
 
 2.  Bilateral perihilar opacities, left greater than right, suggestive of mild
 to moderate asymmetric edema.
 
 3.  Partially evaluated are irregular appearance of the left lateral fifth rib
 and the right lateral second rib, raising suspicion for rib fractures.
