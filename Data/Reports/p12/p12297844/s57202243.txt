  1. Interval reduction in left mid lung opacity, which may represent
  redistibution of pleural fluid vs resolution of edema or atelectasis.  2. 
  Bilateral pleural effusions.  3. Opacity at the left lung base, increased from
  prior exam, likley representing atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or
  aspiration in the right clinical setting.  4.  Previously seen small left
  pneumothorax not visualized on this exam, possibly due to technical
  differences or to resolution.  5. Otherwise stable exam.  These findings were
  communicated to Dr. ___ at 9:16 p.m. on ___ by phone.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after cardiac arrest.  Evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:50 a.m.:
 
 Consolidation in the left mid lung has improved substantially, presumably
 atelectasis.  Eversion of the left anterior diaphragmatic recess accompanied
 by subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is good evidence of anterior
 pneumothorax.  Left anterior rib fractures are demonstrated to better
 advantage on subsequent chest radiographs.  Right lung is clear.  Heart size
 normal.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes to the distal
 portion of the nondistended stomach.
