                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A frontal chest radiograph incompletely imaged, with the right costophrenic
 angle and left lower lung excluded from the field of view.  Multiple sternal
 wires are intact.  A cardiac valve replacement is also seen. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged, although it is not optimally
 evaluated on this exam.  Diffusely increased opacity of both lungs is likely
 due to low lung volumes and positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Low lung volumes with probable atelectasis.  Followup imaging
 when the patient is able to cooperate with the exam should be considered.
