                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, recent aortic valve replacement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  The heart remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Apart from minimal atelectasis in the right lung base, no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. 
 Assessment of the medial aspects of both lung apices is obscured by the
 patient's chin and neck projecting over these regions.  Moderate to severe
 degenerative changes are seen in both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  No pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
