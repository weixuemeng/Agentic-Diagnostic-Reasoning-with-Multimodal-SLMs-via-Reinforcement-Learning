                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AVR.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are even lower lung
 volumes.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The hazy
 opacification in the lower lungs, especially on the right, has improved.  This
 suggests some decrease in pleural effusions; however, it may merely reflect
 the upright position of the patient, since there is substantial pleural fluid
 seen posteriorly on the lateral view.
 
 The central catheter remains in place.  Small effusion with compressive
 atelectasis is again seen at the left base.
