                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is new, moderate cardiomegaly with
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and diffuse bilateral heterogeneous
 opacities, consistent with congestive heart failure.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are multiple surgical clips
 in the anterior chest wall adjacent to the sternum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Congestive heart failure.
 2.  No lobar consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  If there is continued
 clinical concern for infection, consider reimaging after optimization of fluid
 status.
