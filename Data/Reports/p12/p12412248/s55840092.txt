  Left basilar atelectasis. No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. Increased
  interstitial markings raising possibility of chronic underlying interstitial
  process. 8 mm nodular opacity in the right midlung.
  Dedicated nonurgent chest CT is suggested to evaluate 8 mm nodular opacity in
  the right midlung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male who feels unsteady on his feet.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate a dilated or tortuous abdominal
 aorta. Heart size is within normal limits. Calcifications about the aortic
 arch are noted. Linear opacity at the left lung base most likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Increased interstitial markings, right greater than left, raises
 the possibility of chronic interstitial process. No focal opacity convincing
 for pneumonia is detected. There is however an 8 mm nodular opacity in the
 right mid lung. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Biapical
 scarring is symmetric. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis. No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. 
 Increased interstitial markings raising possibility of chronic underlying
 interstitial process. 8 mm nodular opacity in the right midlung.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated nonurgent chest CT is suggested to evaluate 8 mm
 nodular opacity in the right midlung.
