 INDICATION:  Status post fall with rising white blood cell count.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  Increased
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may reflect a mild degree of volume
 overload.  No interstitial edema is seen.  No pneumothorax is present.  The
 heart size is also mildly enlarged likely due to volume overload.
