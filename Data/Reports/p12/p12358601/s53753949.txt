                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar streaky opacities which could reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.
