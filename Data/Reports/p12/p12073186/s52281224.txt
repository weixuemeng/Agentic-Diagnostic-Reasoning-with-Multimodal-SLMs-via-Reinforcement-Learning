                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic colon cancer, weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Numerous cavitary nodules and masses are seen within both lungs diffusely,
 which appear increased in size and number compared to the prior exam.  For
 example, a right perihilar mass now measures approximately 2.9 cm, previously
 2.4 cm.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection
 is not excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen, and no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Scarring within the lung apices is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size and number of pulmonary metastases.  Retrocardiac
 streaky opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
