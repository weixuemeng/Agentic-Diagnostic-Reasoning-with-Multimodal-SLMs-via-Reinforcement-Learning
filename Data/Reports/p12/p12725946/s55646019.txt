                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for progression of left pneumonia, in a patient with
 MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___, as well as chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple sternal wires,
 mediastinal clips, as well as a mitral valve prosthesis.  There has been
 interval extubation and removal of an enteric tube. The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  The lungs are relatively well expanded, without significant
 opacity or consolidation to correlate with the consolidation seen on CT chest.
 There may be mild volume loss of the left lower lobe.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No retrocardiac consolidation to correlate with the consolidation seen on
 recent CTA chest.  This may reflect interval resolution of atelectasis/lower
 lobe collapse.
