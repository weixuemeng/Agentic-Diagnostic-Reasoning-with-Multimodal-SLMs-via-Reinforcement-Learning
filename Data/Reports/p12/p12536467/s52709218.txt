                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: Intubation  // Check for tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Lung volumes are low. 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina and an
 enteric tube projects over the stomach with tip excluded from the images. 
 Linear opacities at the bases likely represent atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriate positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
