                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent O2 requirement of unclear
 etiology, worsening clinical exam  // Assess for improvement/worsening of
 lower lobe opacities
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___; chest CT ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been no appreciable change in the extent of widespread bilateral
 reticular opacities. Heterogeneous multifocal areas of consolidation and
 ground-glass opacification are minimally improved in the upper lobes, but a
 rounded focus of consolidation in the right mid lung has slightly worsened. 
 These findings have been more fully characterized on CT of 1 day earlier. 
 Diffusely distended loops of bowel in the imaged upper abdomen are unchanged,
 bilateral incompletely imaged on this chest radiograph exam.
