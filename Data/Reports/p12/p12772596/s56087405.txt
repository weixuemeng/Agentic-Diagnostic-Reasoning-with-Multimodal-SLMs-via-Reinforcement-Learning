 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities at the right
 lung base suggest minor atelectasis.  Partly visualized abdomen shows gastric
 distention as well as dilatation of small and large bowel.  No free air is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis with low lung volumes.  No free
 air identified.  Gastric and bowel distention, incompletely assessed.
