                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS, fever, ?PNA  // please evaluate for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, lungs are clear except
 for a minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base. Although possibly due to
 crowding of vascular structures related to low lung volumes, short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the possibility of an early
 focus of pneumonia given clinical suspicion.
