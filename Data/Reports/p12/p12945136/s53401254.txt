                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic emphysema presenting with headache radiating to bilateral
 ears and shoulders, mild chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, consistent
 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There are bibasilar opacities
 which may be due to atelectasis and scarring, however, underlying infectious
 process or aspiration not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. COPD.
 
 2. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or scarring, however,
 underlying infection or aspiration not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
