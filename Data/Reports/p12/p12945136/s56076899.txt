                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, and the pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with COPD.  Streaky
 opacities within the left lower lobe likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
