                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with altered mental status.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There are increased
 interstitial opacities in the perihilar and lower lung areas, minimal,
 potentially might reflect vascular engorgement but it is difficult to
 determine in the absence of prior studies.  Interstitial process is another
 possibility.  No focal abnormality is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
