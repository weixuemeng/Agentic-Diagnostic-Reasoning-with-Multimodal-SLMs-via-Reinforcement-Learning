                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening crackles on examination, assess for pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Interval increase in pulmonary vascular engorgement is consistent
 with moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity in this setting
 is most likely atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely also
 increased without pneumothorax.  The heart is stably enlarged with otherwise
 normal mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary edema with small bilateral effusions.
