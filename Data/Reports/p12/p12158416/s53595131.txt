                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with transaminitis, left lower extremity weakness
 after  overdose
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 15 53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 Lung volumes are slightly low. Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases likely atelectasis.
