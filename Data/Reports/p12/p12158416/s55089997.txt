                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.8 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior
 borders of the film.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is
 within the lower SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities within the lung bases
 appear more pronounced in the interval, and may reflect worsening atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Worsening opacities in the lung bases suggestive of increased atelectasis.
 Aspiration is not excluded.
