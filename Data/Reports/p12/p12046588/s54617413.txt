                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for aortic pathology.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CTU from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  There is mild tortuosity of the descending aorta unchanged from
 prior. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. However, CT is more sensitive
 for evaluation of aortic pathology.
