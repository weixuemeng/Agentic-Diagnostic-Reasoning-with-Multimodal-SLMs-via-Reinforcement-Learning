                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PTX  chest tube now on water seal  //
 interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, no gross pneumothorax is identified.  The
 possibility of a tiny right apical or anterior pneumothorax cannot be entirely
 excluded.
 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is a pigtail catheter overlying the right upper lung and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The right costophrenic angle is not well visualized and could be
 slightly blunted due to a small amount of pleural fluid.
 
 The known  posterior right eighth rib fracture is not well visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
