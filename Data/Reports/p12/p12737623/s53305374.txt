                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p mountain bicycle accident w/ traumatic right pneumothorax
 s/p pigtail placement to water seal  // interval pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has a known posterior right eighth rib fracture, not well depicted
 on these views.
 
 Again seen is pigtail catheter overlying the right upper lung, with platelike
 subsegmental atelectasis at the right base, essentially unchanged.
 
 A tiny right apical pneumothorax appears to be present, very slightly larger
 than on the prior study.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Subsegmental atelectasis at
 the left base is again also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper zone pigtail catheter in place, with subsegmental atelectasis the
 right lung base, similar to prior.  There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax,
 very slightly larger than on the prior study.
