                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___. CT Chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  The aorta appears mildly tortuous,
 otherwise, the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen, with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Opacity at the left lateral lung base has slightly
 increased compared to the prior exam, likely secondary to atelectasis.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Deformity of the distal right
 clavicle appears similar compared to the exam from ___.  Old
 healed lateral left eighth and ninth rib fractures are stable compared to the
 CT chest from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle increase in opacity at the left lateral lung base may be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
