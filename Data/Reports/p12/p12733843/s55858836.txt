                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain since this a.m.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left
 base opacity is seen, possibly due to atelectasis vs artifact; no focal
 consolidation seen on CT.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with
 leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The right lung is clear.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Aortic knob calcification is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left base opacity is seen, possibly due to atelectasis vs
 artifact; no focal consolidation seen on CT.
