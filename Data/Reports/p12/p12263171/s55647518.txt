                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PICC which was pulled back accidentally.
 Assess placement  // Please assess PICC location
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right subclavian line has been retracted.
 The tip now overlies the proximal SVC, probably near the junction with the
 innominate vessel. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is atelectasis at the left base, with an elevated left
 hemidiaphragm. The degree of left base opacity is slightly worse, but overall
 similar. Mild prominence of the upper zone vessels is similar to the prior
 exam and likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Doubt overt CHF.
 
 Left axillary clips again noted. The patient's known left breast implant is
 not well appreciated radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval retraction of right subclavian line, with tip now overlying the
 proximal SVC.
