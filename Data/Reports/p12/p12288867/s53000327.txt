                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has increased since
 the prior study.  A small right pleural effusion is grossly stable.  There is
 no pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Heart size is slightly
 enlarged but stable. Prominence of the ascending aortic countour is stable. 
 
 The pulmonary arteries are large, particularly the left, unchanged since ___. Both were mildly enlarged on ___, the only other prior chest
 image. I would suggest clinical assessment and evaluation of the left
 diaphragmatic region for a source of left dominant pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing left pleural effusion, now moderate in size.  Stable, very small,
 right pleural effusion.
 
 Exacerabation of probably long standing pulmonary artery dilatation, left
 greater than right.
