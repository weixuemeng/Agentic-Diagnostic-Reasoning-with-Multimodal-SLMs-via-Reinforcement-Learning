                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent effusions, status post thoracocentesis, questionable
 recurrence.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are minimal
 effusions, left more than right, restricted to the areas of the costophrenic
 sinus on both the frontal and the lateral image.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 also unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly with massive known dilatation of the left
 and right pulmonary arteries, indicative of pulmonary hypertension.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Moderate flattening of the hemidiaphragms,
 apparent on the lateral radiograph only.
