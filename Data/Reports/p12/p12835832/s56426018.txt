                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal streaky
 opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.  No consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe which could reflect
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
