                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of syncope, please evaluate for an acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There appears to be consolidation along the left lower lobe with
 obscuration of the left cardiophrenic angle as well as opacification of the
 posterior lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion, as well as mild thickening of a major fissure.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. There appears to be a focal consolidation along the left lower lobe with
 obscuration of the left cardiophrenic angle. This could be secondary to a fat
 pad or atelectasis, however an acute infectious process cannot be ruled out on
 this study.
 
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
