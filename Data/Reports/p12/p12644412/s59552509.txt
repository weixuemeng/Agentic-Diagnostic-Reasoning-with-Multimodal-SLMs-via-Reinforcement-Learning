                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.
 
 No prior chest radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Both lungs are well expanded.  Focal opacity in the left lower lung which is
 not clearly seen on lateral radiograph is concerning for pneumonic
 consolidation, likely within the lingular lobe.  Right lung is clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal pneumonia in the left lung most likely in the lingular
 lobe.
