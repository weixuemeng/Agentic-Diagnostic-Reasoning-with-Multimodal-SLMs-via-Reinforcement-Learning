                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: A-fib, assess for acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are low in volume but otehrwise clear. Left hemidiaphragm
 is somewhat obscured in its lateral-most component, though this could be
 projectional. The left lung base is poorly imaged. There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable marked cardiomegaly is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Questionable opacity in left base. When the patient's clinical
 status improves, repeat evaluation by PA and lateral chest radiograph is
 recommended to exclude a pleural effusion or left basilar parenchymal process.
