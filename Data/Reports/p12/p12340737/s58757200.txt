 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute worsening of dementia and delirium, possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  There is minimal atelectasis at
 both lung bases but no evidence of a focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
 No pleural effusions.  No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
