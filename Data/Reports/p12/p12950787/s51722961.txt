                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased supplemental oxygen support.
 5LNC w/ sats ___%. // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, the base  of the aerated right lung has elevated, changed
 configuration obscuring much of the right heart border.  Even thought the
 mediastinum is midline the findings are best explained by collapse of the
 right middle and lower lobes. A left retrocardiac opacity obscures the margin
 of the descending thoracic aorta and the medial diaphragmatic interface, most
 likely due to atelectasis of the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
 Bilateral small pleural effusions are possible. There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar structures are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable collapse of the right lung middle and lower lobes and probable
 basilar atelectasis of the left lung, new since ___. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are possible, but not clinically significant, that is, not
 responsible for the severe atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 2:04 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
