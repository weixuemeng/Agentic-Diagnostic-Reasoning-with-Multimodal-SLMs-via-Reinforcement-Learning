                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with right sided chest pain  // r/o infiltrate CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis in the setting of
 lower lung volumes.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal
 consolidation, large effusion or edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable and accentuated on today's exam due to technique and lower lung
 volumes.  Catheter, presumably from VP shunt, projects over the right side of
 the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
