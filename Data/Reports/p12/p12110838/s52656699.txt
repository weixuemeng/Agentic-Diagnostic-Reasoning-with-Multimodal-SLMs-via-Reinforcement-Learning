                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis and bright red blood per
 rectum post-procedure.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:09 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip 5 cm above
 the carina.  The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip not identified.  A right internal jugular central line has its tip in
 the right atrium, unchanged.  There is interval decrease in lung volumes with
 bibasilar airspace opacities and likely pleural effusions.  These findings
 favor partial lower lobe atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia or
 aspiration can not be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  There is widening of the mediastinal contours, which may
 related to vascular crowding given the markedly low volumes.  Followup imaging
 once the patient is clinically stable would be advised.  Cardiac size is
 stable and within the upper limits of normal given portable technique.
