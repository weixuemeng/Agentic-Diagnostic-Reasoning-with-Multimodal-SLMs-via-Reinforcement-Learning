                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cirrhosis, esophageal varices.  Hypoxemia and
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Stability of the bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.  The rounded
 focal opacity is unchanged in the right middle lung.  There is no pneumothorax
 and no significant pleural effusion.  The endotracheal tube is in adequate
 position at 6.4 cm above the carina.  There is a right jugular line projecting
 in the cavoatrial junction.  The nasogastric tube and the feeding tube are
 also in adequate position.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged
 and within normal limits.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no significant change since the previous exam.  There are bilateral
 lower lobe atelectasis/consolidations with a more focal round opacity in the
 right lung mostly compatible with an infectious process.
