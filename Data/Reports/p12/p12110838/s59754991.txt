                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 209
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis, shortness of breath and
 increasing oxygen requirement, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to previous study of ___ at 843.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 2:09 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the right
 atrium.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.  There is a
 prominent amount of gas within the stomach.  Surgical skin ___ are seen
 overlying the mid abdomen.  Lung volumes remain markedly diminished.  There
 are likely small bilateral effusions.  Since the previous study, there is more
 patchy opacity at the right base, which could represent patchy atelectasis or
 an evolving pneumonia.  Followup imaging would be advised.  There has been
 interval removal of the endotracheal tube.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, heart is stable in size.  Mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning and rotation between
 studies.
