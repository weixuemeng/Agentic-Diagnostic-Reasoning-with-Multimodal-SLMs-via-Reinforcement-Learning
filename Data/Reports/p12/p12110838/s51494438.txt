                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis, evaluate endotracheal tube
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 15:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  The right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip
 in the right atrium.  There is slight improvement in lung volumes, but there
 is persistent bibasilar consolidation suggestive of lower lobe atelectasis
 when correlated with CT of ___.  A superimposed infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  There is also likely a left layering pleural effusion. 
 There is fullness to both hilar regions, which may represent prominent
 vasculature as lymphadenopathy would be less likely given the absence of
 significant lymphadenopathy on the recent chest CT of ___.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
