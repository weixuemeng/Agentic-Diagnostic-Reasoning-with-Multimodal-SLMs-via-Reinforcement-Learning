                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with diffuse interstitial infiltrates in the
 setting of R-CHOP.  Recently started on prednisone.  Evaluation for
 improvement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Compared with
 prior studies, there is some interval improvement in both the previously seen
 bilateral ground-glass opacities as well as the diffuse peripheral reticular
 interstitial opacifications.  There is no evidence of focal pneumonia, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged,
 again demonstrating aortic tortuosity with slight tracheal deviation to the
 right.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Slight interval improvement in both bilateral ground-glass
 opacities as well as diffuse bilateral peripheral reticular opacifications.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 12:00, five minutes after discovery was made.
