                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Possible drug reaction.  Assess interval change from reticular
 abnormality after steroid treatment.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The predominantly peripheral reticular pulmonary abnormality and associated
 ground-glass opacification has not worsened since ___, but I am not
 sure that it is any better.  CT scanning compared to chest CT on ___
 would give more imaging information, but I suspect clinical monitoring would
 be more revealing.  Heart size is normal.  There is no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation or focal pneumonia.
