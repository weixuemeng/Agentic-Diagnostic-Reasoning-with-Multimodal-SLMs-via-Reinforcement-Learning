                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of lymphoma and lung abnormalities, in
 followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Diffuse
 peripheral reticular opacities are grossly unchanged.  The component of
 ground-glass diffuse opacities has improved.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. 
 
 As mentioned before, these findings are most likely due to drug reaction
 rather than infection.
