                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with lymphoma and new oxygen requirement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 The coarse reticular infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which progressed
 substantially between ___, when it was new compared to the torso CT
 dated in ___ and ___ has a different appearance today.  I am not
 sure whether this represents improvement or just variation in radiographic
 technique.  For example, in the axillary region of the right upper lobe the
 abnormality is more coarse and confluent today than it was yesterday.  On the
 other hand, there may have been some remission in the extent of interstitial
 infiltration in the left lower lung.  Since the process have begun several
 weeks ago and the patient has not manifested infection, I doubt that this is
 interstitial pneumonia.  Instead, I think it is a pulmonary complication or
 reaction to chemotherapy, which appears to have successfully decreased the
 volume of lymph node enlargement in the chest, particularly in the right
 hilus, since ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 Findings were discussed at length by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of
 this dictation.
