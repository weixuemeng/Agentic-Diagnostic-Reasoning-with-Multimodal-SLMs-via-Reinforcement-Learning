                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As on the
 prior study, there is flattening of the diaphragms consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Chronic prominence of the interstitial
 markings is mildly more conspicuous on the current study as compared to prior.
 Patchy lateral left upper lobe and bibasilar opacities are seen, of
 indeterminate age, but underlying infectious process is not excluded. 
 Recommend followup to resolution.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
