                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Interstitial disease to assess for acute pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right hemidiaphragm is not as
 sharply seen, raising the possibility of developing consolidation at the right
 base.  However, there also appears to be slight increase in opacification at
 the left base, suggesting that much of this may merely reflect atelectatic
 change.
