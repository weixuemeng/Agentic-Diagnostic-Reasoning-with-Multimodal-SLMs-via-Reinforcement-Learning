 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Patient is intubated with the
 tip of the endotracheal tube positioned 4.5 cm above the carinal.  An NG tube
 courses into the left upper abdomen.  Overlying EKG leads are present. There
 are subtle lower lung opacities which likely represent a combination of
 atelectasis with possible superimposed aspiration.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes positioned appropriately.  Subtle lower
 lung opacities likely atelectasis versus mild aspiration.
