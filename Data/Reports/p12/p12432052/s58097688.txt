 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is only mild residual peribronchial opacification in the medial basal
 segment of the right lower lobe where pneumonia has almost entirely cleared. 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size is
 top normal as before.  Given the near complete resolution of pneumonia, no
 radiographic followup is indicated in the absence of signs or symptoms.
