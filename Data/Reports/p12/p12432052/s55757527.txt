                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate right lung base
 opacity obscuring right hemidiaphragm and partially obscuring the right
 cardiac border.  The opacity projects over lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 view.  The right costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small pleural
 effusion.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The
 heart size is normal.  A partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 Small-to-moderate levoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung base opacity appears new from ___ exam, with associated small
 right pleural effusion, suggestive of pneumonia.
