                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of presyncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Multiple calcified granulomas are again seen, stable.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 There may be a new sclerosis involving the anterior, inferior aspect of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body, versus overlying structures, if patient has
 lower back pain and history of malignancy, further dedicated imaging of this
 location suggested.
