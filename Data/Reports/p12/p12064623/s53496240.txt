 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:24 AM
  1. Low lung volumes with increased retrocardiac density, possibly atelectasis,
  although underlying infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
  setting.
  2. Interval progression of anterior wedge compression deformity of a mid
  thoracic vertebral body.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and shortness of breath  // eval for
 infiltrate versus edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are slightly low.  Increased retrocardiac density likely
 represents atelectasis.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is
 present.  Median sternotomy wires, mitral valve replacement, and pacemaker
 device are unchanged in position.  There has been interval progression of a
 mid thoracic vertebral body compression fracture since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with increased retrocardiac density, likely atelectasis.
 2. Interval progression of anterior wedge compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body.
