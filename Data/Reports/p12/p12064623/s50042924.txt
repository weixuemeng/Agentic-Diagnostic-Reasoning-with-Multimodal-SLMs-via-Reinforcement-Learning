                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with systolic CHF, pulm HTN, asthma admitted
 with dyspnea, hypoxia. CXR c/f multifocal PNA vs. asymmetrical pulm edema.  ?
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is post median sternotomy, mitral replacement.  Left-sided
 defibrillator, with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle, is
 unchanged.  Previously seen ill-defined nodular and hazy opacities in the
 right lung have greatly improved since the radiograph from 2 days prior,
 suggesting these were due to pulmonary edema.  However, persistent opacities
 in the right could be due to residual asymmetric edema or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Significant improvement in asymmetric right lung opacities, suggesting
 they were due to pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Persistent opacities in the right lung may be due to residual asymmetric
 edema or infection.
