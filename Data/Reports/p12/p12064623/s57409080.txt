                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, cough, wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. 
 Left-sided AICD/pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly increased in
 size compared to the previous study.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 diffusely noted throughout the thoracic aorta.  Ill-defined nodular and hazy
 opacities are seen throughout the right lung, and likely involving the left
 mid lung field, which may reflect multifocal pneumonia with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema a differential consideration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia primarily involving the right
 lung, with markedly asymmetric pulmonary edema within the differential
 diagnosis.  Followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended for further
 assessment.
