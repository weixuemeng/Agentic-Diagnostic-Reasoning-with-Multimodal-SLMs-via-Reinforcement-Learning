                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left shoulder pain radiating to the arm.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pacemaker is in unchanged position with the leads in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  A mitral valve replacement is in unchanged
 position.  Sternal wires are intact.  The lung volumes are low.  The lungs are
 clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is enlarged,
 and appears slightly bigger than in the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, possibly slightly increased from the prior exam,
 which could be due to an increased heart size of pericardial effusion. 
 Alternatively, the cardiac size could be exaggerated by low lung volumes and
 positioning.
