                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with duodenal perft w/p ___ patch. now with
 leak. NG/J-tube in place now with shortness of breath.  // ? pulmonary edema
 vs atelectasis. compare to prior study
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT has been removed.  Right-sided IJV CVP in situ with the tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  NG tube in situ with the tip in the distal stomach. 
 Interval improvement in lung volumes.  New opacity in the right upper lobe may
 be rotational in nature or may represent lung pathology.  Large right-sided
 pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is mildly improved.  Moderate
 sized left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is mildly
 improved.  Surgical drain in-situ in the right abdomen.  Surgical clips in the
 midline.  Dense bowel content suggests a previous contrast study.  Evidence of
 previous cervical spinal fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the right upper lobe may be rotational nature or may represent new
 airspace consolidation (pneumonia).  Interval improvement in lung volumes with
 persistent large right-sided pleural effusion and moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Lower lobe atelectasis is slightly improved.
