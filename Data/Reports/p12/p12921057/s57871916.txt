                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of the heart is re- demonstrated.   Extensive coronary
 artery calcifications are present. Aortic knob demonstrates dense
 calcifications.  The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unchanged. 
 There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 of the thoracic spine are present.  Known sclerotic metastatic lesions within
 the axial skeleton are better assessed on the prior CT.  Degenerative changes
 of the right glenohumeral joint are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
