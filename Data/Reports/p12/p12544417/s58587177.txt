 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  AVR, evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has further slightly increased.  Bilateral pleural effusions of
 moderate extent are now better visible, notably given the availability of a
 lateral image.  There are currently no signs suggestive of pulmonary edema,
 but the double contour at the level of the aortic arch persists in unchanged
 manner.  No pneumonia, but atelectatic changes at both lung bases.  No
 pneumothorax.
