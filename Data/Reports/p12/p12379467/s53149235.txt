                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cancer, on chemo, now with inc. weakness
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged
 with catheter tip in the region of the mid SVC.  Subtle increased opacity
 along the lateral aspect of the left lung may reflect overlying soft tissues. 
 Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity along the left lateral lung thought to represent overlying
 soft tissues.  Obliques views may be helpful to resolve this finding. 
 Otherwise unremarkable exam.
