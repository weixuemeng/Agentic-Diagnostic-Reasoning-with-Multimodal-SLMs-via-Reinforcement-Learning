                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma now with shortness of breath,
 wheezing, and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs chest dated ___ and ___ and CT of the chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate well expanded clear
 lungs. The previously seen area of increased opacification in the left lower
 lobe was better evaluated on recent CT of the chest.  There is no
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Known hilar lymphadenopathy is better assessed
 on the recent CT of the chest as well. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is present
 with the tip terminating in the mid SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
