                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right pleural biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT interventional procedure performed ___ and CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates similar
 appearance to ___ chest CT with severely thickened irregular pleura
 extending into the fissure and encasing the entire shrunken asymmetrically
 opacified right lung with areas of septal thickening.  The left lung and
 pleura are clear.   No pneumothorax is present.  Visible cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable examination.  Dense irregular pleural thickening with
 diffuse increased opacification of right lung with septal thickening likely
 represents mesothelioma with less likely consideration given to lymphangitic
 spread and pleural seeding of other primary malignancy.
