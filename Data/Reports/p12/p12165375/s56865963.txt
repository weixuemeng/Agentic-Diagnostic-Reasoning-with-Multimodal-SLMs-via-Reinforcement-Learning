 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress, left lower lobe collapse, evaluation
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement of
 the pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild atelectasis in the
 retrocardiac lung areas, however, persists.  The now non-atelectatic lung
 shows signs of reexpansion pulmonary edema.  Unchanged mild right basal
 atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.  Unchanged appearance of the
 monitoring and support devices.
