                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of ET tube placement.  Known pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CTA-Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates ET tube
 terminating 1.9 cm above the carina.  The lung volumes are low bilaterally and
 there is a moderate pleural effusion on the right with basilar atelectasis. 
 Leftward deviation of the trachea and mediastinum are consistent with volume
 loss from left lower lobe collapse.  Aortic arch calcifications are
 visualized, but the remaining portions of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are
 not well seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ETT termiantes 1.9 cm above the carina.  This can be withdrawn 1cm to
 prevent collapse of the still aerated right lung.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse.  Please correlate with results of CTA-Chest,
 which show complete left lung collapse.
