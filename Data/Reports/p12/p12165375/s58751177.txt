                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress with left lower lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes with the monitoring and support devices remaining in place. 
 Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  There may be small bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 previous area of nonatelectatic lung at the left base shows some evidence of
 reexpansion pulmonary edema.  Atelectatic changes persist at the right base.
