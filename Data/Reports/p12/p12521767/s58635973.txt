                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain, left arm
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left
 mid lung opacity is seen, raising concern for pneumonia.  There may be
 scarring/fibrotic changes at the lateral right upper lobe.  Underlying
 pulmonary emphysema is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left mid lung opacity may represent pneumonia.  However,
 in this patient with background of pulmonary emphysema, recommend followup to
 resolution to exclude an underlying lesion.  Possible focal fibrotic changes
 at the lateral right upper lung.
