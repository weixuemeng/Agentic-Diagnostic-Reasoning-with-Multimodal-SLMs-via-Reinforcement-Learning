                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Repeat study with nipple markers.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, a repeat
 examination was performed without nipple markers.  However, there is no
 evidence of the nodular opacification at the right base previously suggested.
 
 The examination is within normal limits.
