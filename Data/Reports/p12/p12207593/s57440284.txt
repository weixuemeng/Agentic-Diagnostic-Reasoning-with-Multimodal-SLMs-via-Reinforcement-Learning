 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette has increased in size compared to previous
 study, probably due to a combination of cardiomegaly, known  pericardial
 effusion, and accentuation by low lung volumes and portable technique. 
 Catheter overlying the heart may reflect a pericardial drain.  Widespread
 pulmonary opacities are present, and could be due to widespread pulmonary
 edema, but differential diagnosis includes drug reaction and pulmonary
 hemorrhage.  Known underlying pulmonary neoplastic disease is seen to better
 detail on recent CT torso ___ ___.
