 history obtained from medical record includes advanced non-small cell lung
 cancer and recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.    There diffusely increased interstitial
 markings in lungs bilaterally, with a more confluent consolidation at the
 right lung base in region of patient's known mass however, this appear
 slightly more extensive.  There may be superimposed infection or atelectasis
 in setting of lower lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 noting increased density in the right paratracheal region compatible with
 known adenopathy.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings in the lungs potentially due to pulmonary
 vascular congestion or atypical infection.  More confluent consolidation of
 the right lung base in part due to known lung mass with possible adjacent
 atelectasis or superimposed infection.
