 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient has been extubated, and NG tube has been removed.  Improved
 pulmonary edema is now mild.  Left lower lobe consolidation which could
 reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or small pleural effusion is stable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac contour is enlarged in this patient with
 chronically distended pulmonary arteries which reflects pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines have been removed.
 2.  Improved mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable left lower lung consolidation.
