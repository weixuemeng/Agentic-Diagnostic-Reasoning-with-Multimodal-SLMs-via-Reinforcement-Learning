                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a low position of the endotracheal tube, which is seen
 with its tip located only 11 mm above the carina.  Retraction by at least 2 cm
 would result in a more optimal position.  The NG tube tracks into the left
 upper quadrant.  There is hilar vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema.
 Lung volumes limit evaluation.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  No pneumothorax
 or large effusion.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low position of ET tube and retraction by at least 2 cm is
 advised.  NG tube positioned appropriately.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. 
 
 Prelim report flagged on ED Dashboard.
