                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver ablation, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  No acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles with posterior opacification on the
 lateral view again is consistent with pleural effusion and areas of basilar
 atelectasis.
 
 The right chest tube is not identified at this time.
