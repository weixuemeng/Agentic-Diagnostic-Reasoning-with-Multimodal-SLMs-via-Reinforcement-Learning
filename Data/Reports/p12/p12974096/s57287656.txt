 HISTORY:  Chest tube clamping, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following
 clamping of the chest tube there is no evidence of expansion of the previously
 demonstrated small apical pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
