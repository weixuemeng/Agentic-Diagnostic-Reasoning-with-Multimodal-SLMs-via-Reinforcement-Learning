                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with shortness of breath and cough, concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The tip of the right chest Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  There
 are coarse interstitial markings.  An asymmetrically increased opacity is
 present in the right lower lobe with poor definition of vessels.  No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in right lower lobe, which may reflect an early
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
