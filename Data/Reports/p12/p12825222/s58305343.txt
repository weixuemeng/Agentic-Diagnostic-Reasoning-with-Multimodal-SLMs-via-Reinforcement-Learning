                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Hemopneumothorax outside hospital study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large right pneumothorax with collapse of the right lobe.  There is
 also a small right pleural effusion.  Minimal to no tension is identified. 
 The left lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Known large right pneumothorax with small pleural effusion consistent with
 hydropneumothorax.  Opacity in the collapsed right lung likely relates to lung
 collapse.  Recommend repeat after re-expansion.
