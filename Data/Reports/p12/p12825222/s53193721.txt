                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 20:05.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recurrent right pneumothorax, status
 post lumpectomy and pleurodesis. Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 15:57.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 20:05 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval placement of two right-sided chest tubes. 
 Suggestion of a tiny amount of air loculated at the right apex.  Lung volumes
 are diminished and there has been interval appearance of predominantly patchy
 opacity at the right base with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm suggestive
 of partial right lower lobe atelectasis.  Few scattered patchy opacities in
 the left lung also likely reflect atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in positioning and technique.
