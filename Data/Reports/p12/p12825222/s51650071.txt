                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of right-sided chest tubes, no definite
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Postoperative changes are present in the right
 lung consistent with history of bullectomy procedure, with some associated
 volume loss, architectural distortion and linear atelectasis.  Patchy and
 linear atelectasis at the left base has also slightly worsened in the
 interval, and small pleural effusions are again demonstrated.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema in right chest wall has slightly increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax following removal of right-sided chest tubes.
