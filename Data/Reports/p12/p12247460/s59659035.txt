                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Myastenic crisis, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, potentially reflecting a decrease in ventilatory pressure.  As a
 consequence, atelectatic changes at both lung bases as well as signs
 indicative of mild fluid overload have increased.  The cardiac silhouette
 appears larger than on the previous exam.  There are currently no other new
 focal parenchymal opacities, notably no pneumonia.  The monitoring and support
 devices are in constant position.
