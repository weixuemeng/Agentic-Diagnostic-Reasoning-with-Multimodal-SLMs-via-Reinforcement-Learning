                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right rib pain and tenderness, evaluate for
 rib fracture or pulmonary contusion.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no displaced rib fracture.  The
 lungs are clear, without a pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture.  If clinical concern for rib fracture
 persists, consider rib series, which is more sensitive.
