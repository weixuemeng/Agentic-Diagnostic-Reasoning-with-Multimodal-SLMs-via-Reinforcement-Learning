 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new from the prior study with associated
 bibasilar opacity, left greater than right.  Findings most likely represent
 partial lower lobe atelectasis although it pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small bilateral pleural effusions with probable adjacent atelectasis,
 although pneumonia critically at the left base cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
