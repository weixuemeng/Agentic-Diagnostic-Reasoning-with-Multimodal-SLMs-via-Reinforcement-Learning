                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dizziness, malaise, elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 lingular linear atelectasis/scarring.  Azygos fissure anatomy is again seen. 
 Patchy left base opacity may relate to atelectasis, although developing
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
