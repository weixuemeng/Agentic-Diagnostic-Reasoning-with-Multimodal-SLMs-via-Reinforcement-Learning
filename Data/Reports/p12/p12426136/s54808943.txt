                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p polytrauma with ETT too high, just advanced  // eval for
 location of ETT      eval for location of ETT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has
 been advanced so that the tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina. 
 Otherwise, there is little change.
 There is some asymmetry of opacification in the right upper to mid zone.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could possibly represent an area of
 developing aspiration or pneumonia.
