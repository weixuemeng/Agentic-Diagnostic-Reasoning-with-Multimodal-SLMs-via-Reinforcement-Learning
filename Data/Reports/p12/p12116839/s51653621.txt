                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Previous diagnosis of pneumonia, failed two courses of antibiotics.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  A focal left lower lobe consolidation with a
 correlate on lateral view obscures the diaphragmatic contour and is compatible
 with pneumonia.  A more subtle area of increased density in the right lung
 base is also worrisome for infection.  There is probable small bilateral
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right lower lobe pneumonia with small
 effusions.
