 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:40 AM
  Stable position of right-sided PICC line with distal tip projecting over the
  right atrium.
  
  1. Unchanged appearance of retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left
  hemidiaphragm, likely representing an unchanged small left pleural effusion
  with adjacent left basilar atelectasis, however an infectious consolidation
  cannot be excluded by radiograph.  Clear right lung.
  2. No pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man S/P gastric perforation  // Pleural effusion     
 Pleural effusion
 ___-year-old man with a gastric sleeve leak and pleural effusion.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:
 Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Interval removal of NG tube.  Right PICC ends in the right atrium and could be
 withdrawn 3 cm in order for tip to end in the lower SVC.  Persistent
 consolidation at the left base reflects moderate left pleural effusion. 
 Rounded left retrocardiac opacity may reflect loculated pleural fluid or a
 rapidly developing lung abscess.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion.
 Rounded left retrocardiac opacity may reflect loculated pleural fluid or a
 rapidly developing lung abscess.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Chest CT if there is concern for left lung or pleural abscess.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 08:18 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
