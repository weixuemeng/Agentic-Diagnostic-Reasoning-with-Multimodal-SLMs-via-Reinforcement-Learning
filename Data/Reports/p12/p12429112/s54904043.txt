                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infiltrate in a patient with RCC metastatic to the
 lungs, presenting with hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bulky mediastinal and hilar
 lymph node enlargement, consistent with known metastatic lesions.  A poorly
 defined mass in the left lower lung is also compatible with known metastatic
 lesion.  No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is identified.  There
 is no appreciable flow pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No new focal lesion to suggest bacterial pneumonia.
 2. Bulky intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and left lower lobe mass are compatible
 with known metastatic disease as seen on CT from ___.
