                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, on
 chemotherapy with focal left axillary rib pain.  Assess for fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  The left sixth posterior rib appears irregular which
 corresponds with the site of known metastatic lesion on prior CT.  A
 pathological fracture through this level has been seen on prior CT exams
 dating back to ___.  A lesion in the left lateral arch of the seventh rib
 is also noted with bulbous expansion at this level appearing grossly unchanged
 from prior CT.  Additional osseous metastatic lesions are better assessed on
 the recent CT chest from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rib lesions on the left likely account for patient's complaint of
 left lateral rib pain.  A chronic pathological fracture involving the left
 sixth rib has been seen on multiple prior exams.
