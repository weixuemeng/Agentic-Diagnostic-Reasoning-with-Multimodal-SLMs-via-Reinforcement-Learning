                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cirrhosis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Cardiomegaly is
 substantial.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Mild interstitial opacities,
 unchanged since the prior study, are redemonstrated.  Note is made that the
 radiograph is slightly lordotic and may accentuate the cardiac silhouette as
 well as the position of the PICC line, but it is most likely still above the
 cavoatrial junction.  No substantial pleural effusion demonstrated.
 
 Attention to the right mid and lower lobe opacities is important since they
 potentially might reflect infectious process.  Alternatively, the assessment
 after diuresis is recommended.
