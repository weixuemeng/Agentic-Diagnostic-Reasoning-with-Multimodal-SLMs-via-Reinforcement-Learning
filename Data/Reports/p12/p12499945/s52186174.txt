                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  GI bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. Left PICC
 has been removed.  Scarring is seen within the lung apices. Increased
 peripheral interstitial markings are noted bilaterally, more pronounced within
 the upper lung zones, and reflective of a chronic interstitial abnormality,
 better assessed on the prior CT.  Atelectatic changes are noted in the lung
 bases, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or definite pneumothorax
 is identified.  Skin ___ are seen projecting over the midline abdomen.  No
 free subdiaphragmatic air is seen though the patient is not an optimal upright
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No subdiaphragmatic free air demonstrated on this semi-upright exam.
 2. Chronic interstitial abnormality most pronounced in the upper lobes, as
 demonstrated on the prior CT which was characterized as subpleural
 interstitial fibrosis.
 3. Patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
