                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with esophageal perforation, pneumomediastinum 
 // Please evaluate interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now rotated. The left
 PICC line is in unchanged position. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The
 radiographic signs of new more mediastinum and pneumoperitoneum are less
 obvious than on the previous image but this seems to be any increasing
 interstitial pattern, likely caused by fluid overload, in the right lung.  No
 larger pleural effusions.
