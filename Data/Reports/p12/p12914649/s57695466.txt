                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and probable pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes have improved and aeration has increased at the base of the left
 lung, although there is still substantial bilateral pneumonia, involving the
 left mid lung, axillary region of the right lung somewhat improved, and the
 right lung base, probably unchanged.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion.  Heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and dilated
 because of chronic dissection.  No pneumothorax.  There may be
 pneumomediastinum, presumably a function of labored breathing.
