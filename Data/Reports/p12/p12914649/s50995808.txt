                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:15 a.m.
 
 Compared to the earlier film, there are lower inspiratory volumes.  Again seen
 is the alveolar opacity in the left mid zone, together with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion.  There is new faint
 patchy opacity in the right mid zone.  Patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region is similar to the prior film, allowing for differences in
 technique.  There is probable mild cardiomegaly and a tortuous aorta.   An NG
 tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 Right paratracheal soft tissues are noted, unchanged.  Targeted review of a
 ___ chest CT suggests that this represents a combination of the thyroid
 and vascular silhouettes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New patchy opacity in right midzone. Left midzone opacity, left lower lobe
 collpase and/or consolidation, and small left efusion are unchanged.
