 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky opacification in the right mid

 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  There is no pneumomediastinum.  No free air is identified below the
 hemidiaphragms.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is present with the tip in the low
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or free intraperitoneal air. 
 Minimal right atelectasis.
