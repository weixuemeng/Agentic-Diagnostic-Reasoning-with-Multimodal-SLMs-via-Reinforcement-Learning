 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post Nissen surgery and fundoplication.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 fundoplication surgery.  The position of the left subclavian line is
 unchanged.  Very low lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at both lung
 bases, likely post-surgical in origin.  The chest x-ray shows no convincing
 evidence of free intra-abdominal air.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly.
