 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p myomectomy  // eval effusions vs pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The pre-existing millimetric right apical pneumothorax is no longer clearly
 identified.  The lung volumes have decreased.  Areas of atelectasis are
 present at both the left and the right lung base.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Signs of mild pulmonary edema.  No larger pleural effusions.  The monitoring
 and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter, are in unchanged normal
