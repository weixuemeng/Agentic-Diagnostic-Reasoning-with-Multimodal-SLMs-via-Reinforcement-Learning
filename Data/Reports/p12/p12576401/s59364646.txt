                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: On chemo, now with low-grade fevers and chest pain.  Assess for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has been
 interval removal of the left PICC line.  An esophageal stent is in place.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with emphysema.  There is emphysema with
 reticular opacity in the lungs without definite focal consolidation, effusion,
 edema, or pneumothorax.  A calcified nodular opacity projecting over the left
 upper lung corresponds with a calcified pleural plaque seen on prior CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is a prominent anterior
 osteophyte of the thoracic spine.  No other bony abnormality is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Emphysema, no definite signs of pneumonia.
