 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, chills, lightheadness  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight increase in opacity over the inferior spine on the lateral view, not
 substantiated on the frontal view, felt to unlikely represent consolidation,
 possibly atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle increase in opacity over the inferior spine on the lateral view, not
 substantiated on the frontal view, felt to unlikely represent consolidation,
 possibly atelectasis vs artifact.
