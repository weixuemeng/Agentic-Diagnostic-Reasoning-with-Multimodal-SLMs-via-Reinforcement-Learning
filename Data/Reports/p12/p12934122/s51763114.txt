 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous

 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Surgical clips project over the right
 upper quadrant.  There is again slight rightward convex curvature centered
 along the mid thoracic spine with small-to-moderate marginal mid thoracic
 osteophytes.
