                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with status epilepticus, intubated  // eval for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip 5.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm,
 off film, again seen looping in the stomach.  Right central line tip overlies
 mid/ distal SVC.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip again overlies the main
 pulmonary artery.
 
 Left-sided battery pack again noted.  There is a lead extending cephalad. 
 Note is made that is difficult to trace the lead on the available images.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen is patchy
 retrocardiac opacity and minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 region, similar to prior.  No gross effusion.  Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Battery pack with lead extending cephalad beyond the upper edge of this film. 
 While this may be due to technical factors, note is made that is difficult to
 trace the lead between the battery pack and the third posterior rib on the
 current radiograph.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 
 Patchy opacities at both bases, unchanged.
