                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with status epilepticus, now intubated  // eval
 for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No definite ET tube is identified.  Tubing is folded over the upper airway. 
 At, but could lie outside the patient or could be related to the NG tube. 
 Clinical correlation is required.
 
 An NG tube is present --  the tip extends beneath the diaphragm loops over the
 expected site of the fundus.
 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip over proximal right pulmonary artery.  A
 left subclavian central line is present, tip not well delineated, but likely
 over the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Left-sided battery device is again seen, with lead extending cephalad over
 left neck, beyond the edge of this film.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is dense retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is also
 patchy opacity at the right lung base.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No normal appearance of an ET tube.  Please see subsequent film from ___ at 11:29 showing an ET tube with tip above the level of the clavicular
 heads.
 
 Other lines and tubes as described.
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation and patchy opacity at the right lung base, similar to the prior
 film.  While these could represent pneumonic infiltrates, given the history of
 status epilepticus, the differential would include areas of aspiration
 pneumonitis.
