                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with large right pleural effusion s/p chest tube
 placement  // chest tube placement? interval change?      chest tube
 placement? interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following insertion of a right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter, right
 pleural effusion has almost entirely resolved, but there is a moderate right
 pneumothorax, in the right lower hemithorax suggesting pleural adhesions
 superiorly.  Poor inflation of the right lung base is due to localized
 visceral pleural thickening and/or adhesive atelectasis.
 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Mild
 interstitial edema is probably present, as well as a very small left pleural
 effusion.  The upper esophagus is distended with air, not necessarily
 pathologic.
 
 
 Left subclavian pacer lead tip  projects over the cardiac apex, presumably
 running along the floor of the right ventricle.  No left pneumothorax.
