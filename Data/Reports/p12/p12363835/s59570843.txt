 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___

 slightly worse compared to ___.  No left pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, which has improved. Stable
 mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Left pectoral pacemaker lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening small to moderate right pleural effusion compared to ___.
