                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with episodic shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Moderate
 pulmonary edema is noted, along with a small to moderate size right pleural
 effusion which is partially loculated laterally, as well as a small left
 pleural effusion. Overall, findings are not substantially changed from the
 prior exam. Opacification at the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. There are no definite acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
 not substantially changed from prior.  Bibasilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis.
