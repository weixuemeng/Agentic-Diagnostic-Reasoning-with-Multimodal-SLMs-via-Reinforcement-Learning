                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post-op tachycardia and fever, crackles on
 exam  // eval for pneumonia, cardiomegaly, PE      eval for pneumonia,
 cardiomegaly, PE
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparisons.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 03:47 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of both posterior costophrenic angles likely reflects small
 effusions.  Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base may reflect an area
 of atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. 
 The remaining lungs are clear.  Prominent perihilar vasculature and azygos
 fullness suggest a fluid replete state. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  If pulmonary embolism remains of
 clinical concern, chest CTPA is more sensitive.
