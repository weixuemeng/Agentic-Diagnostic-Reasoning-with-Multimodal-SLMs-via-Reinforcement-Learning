                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation, to look for pulmonary
 congestion as reason to start diuresis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the pulmonary vascularity is
 essentially within normal limits.  Substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists in a patient with intact midline sternal wires following
 CABG.  Lateral view shows that there are bilateral pleural effusions.
