 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 engorgement and mild-to-moderate edema.  Left retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but standard PA and lateral
 chest radiographs may be helpful to exclude other underlying process in this
 region, particularly given clinical concern for pneumonia.
