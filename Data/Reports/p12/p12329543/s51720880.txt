 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, recent worsening of shortness
 of breath.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Catheter is seen, unchanged in position, terminating in the
 proximal-to-mid SVC.  There are low lung volumes with mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is again seen
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Mild basilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Partially imaged
 is cervicothoracic spinal hardware.
