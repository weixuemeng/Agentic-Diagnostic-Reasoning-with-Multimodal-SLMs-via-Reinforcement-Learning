                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A left-sided
 pacer device is again seen, with leads unchanged in position.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The right costophrenic angle is not
 fully included on the frontal view, although no evidence of large pleural
 effusion is seen on the lateral view, although small pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Previously seen mild interstitial edema
 appears slightly improved.  Hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema appears slightly improved.  No definite focal
 consolidation.
