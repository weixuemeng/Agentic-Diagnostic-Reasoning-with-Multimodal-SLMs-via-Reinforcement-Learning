                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  There
 is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is moderate compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body,
 as seen previously, not well assessed on this study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively low lung volumes.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
