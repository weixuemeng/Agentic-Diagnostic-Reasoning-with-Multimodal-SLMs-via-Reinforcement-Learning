                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Eight days of pleuritic chest pain, wheezing, and
 cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lateral view demonstrates wedge compression
 deformity of the lower thoracic vertebral body.  In the retrocardiac area,
 there is a semi-oval opacity noted, projecting at and behind the inferior
 margin of the heart and although might reflect hiatal hernia, mediastinal mass
 in this location cannot be excluded.
 
 Correlation with chest CT is recommended.
 
 There is also evidence of hyperinflation demonstrated.
