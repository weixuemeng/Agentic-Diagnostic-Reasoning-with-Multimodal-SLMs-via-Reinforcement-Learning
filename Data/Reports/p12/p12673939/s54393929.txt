                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB on exertion  // Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Prominent reticular markings noted bilaterally which
 could represent interstitial lung disease in the correct clinical setting.
 Mild edema difficult to exclude. There is no superimposed focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible chronic interstitial lung disease versus mild edema. Consider
 high-resolution CT to further assess if needed.
