                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary edema, now s/p diuresis  // Is
 the pulmonary edema improved?      Is the pulmonary edema improved?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much better
 inspiration.  The interstitial markings are much less prominent, a and could
 reflect some residual pulmonary vascular congestion. However, the pattern is
 somewhat disorganized, raising the possibility of underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease. CT would be necessary to make this diagnosis.
 There are atelectatic changes at the left base, but no definite acute focal
 pneumonia.
