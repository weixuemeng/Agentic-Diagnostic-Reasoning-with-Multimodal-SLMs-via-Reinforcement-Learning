 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  Subtle left base opacity is likely due to combination of minor
 atelectasis and overlapping vascular structures.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base opacity is likely due to combination of minor
 atelectasis and overlapping vascular structures.  No definite focal
