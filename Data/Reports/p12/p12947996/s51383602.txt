                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple lines and tubes  // please eval
 line and tube positions; for any ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval
 placement of multiple lines and tubes.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the
 main pulmonary artery.  ETT tip terminates 5 cm above the carina.  Right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein.
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat lower.  Left retrocardiac opacity is new and likely
 reflects atelectasis.  If there is an effusion on the left, it is small. 
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  Mediastinum is wider but this is unlikely pathologic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiopulmonary support devices are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
