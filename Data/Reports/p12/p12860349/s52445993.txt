 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS,. breast cancer on chemo  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple nodular opacities including in the left upper lung correspond with
 the some of the previously noted pulmonary metastasis. The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. The cardiac
 mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Surgical clips are noted
 within the right anterior chest wall, and a left Port-A-Cath terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction. Partially visualized lesions in the thoracic spine
 correspond with the known osseous metastases seen on prior CT. Posterior
 lumbar fusion surgical hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Metastatic lesions in the lungs and thoracic spine better assessed on prior
 CT. No superimposed pneumonia.
