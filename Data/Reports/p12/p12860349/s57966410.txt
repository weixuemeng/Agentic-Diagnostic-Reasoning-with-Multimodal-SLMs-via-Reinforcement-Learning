                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with worsening confusion/lethargy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Ill-defined nodular opacities are
 again demonstrated most pronounced in both upper lobes compatible with
 metastatic disease, not substantially changed from the prior study. No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion. Numerous clips are noted within the right
 axilla and anterior chest wall. Osseous metastases within the thoracic spine
 are better visualized on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Similar appearance of pulmonary
 metastases.
