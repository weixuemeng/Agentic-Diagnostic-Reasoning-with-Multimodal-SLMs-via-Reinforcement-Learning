                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggest slight atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, the lung bases appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The course of the right lateral seventh rib is anomalous with a
 smooth and slight angulation suggesting remote prior fracture.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
