                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, dyspnea, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW:  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 Extreme lordotic positioning.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity, with
 partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  However, this is likely
 accentuated by patient positioning. The possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate
 in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.  Possible upper zone
 redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.   Heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal or slightly enlarged.  Curvilinear lucency seen at the right base is
 not confirmed on the lateral view and likely represents artifact rather than
 free intra-abdominal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF.
 2) Left lower lobe infiltrate cannot be excluded.
