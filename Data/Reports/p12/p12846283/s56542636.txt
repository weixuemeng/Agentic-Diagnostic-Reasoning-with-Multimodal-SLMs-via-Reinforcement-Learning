                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of RL PNA  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral pleural
 effusions have apparently resolved, with associated improved aeration at both
 lung bases.  Right lower lobe consolidation has slightly improved and is
 likely due to provided history of pneumonia.  New bilateral upper lobe
 airspace opacities could reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration, or extension
 of infectious pneumonia.
