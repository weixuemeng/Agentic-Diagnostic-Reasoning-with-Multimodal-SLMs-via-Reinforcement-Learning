                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size, and there is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Low volumes make it somewhat
 difficult to evaluate the lungs.  There are atelectatic changes at the bases,
 without definite acute focal pneumonia.
