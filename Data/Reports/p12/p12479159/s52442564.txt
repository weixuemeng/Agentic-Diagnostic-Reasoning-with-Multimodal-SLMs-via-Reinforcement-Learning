 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // Lung parenchymal disease     
 Lung parenchymal disease
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 15:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stably enlarged given differences in patient
 positioning.  Minimal patchy opacities at both lung bases likely reflect
 patchy atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  If parenchymal
 lung disease remains of clinical concern, further imaging with CT could be
 performed.
