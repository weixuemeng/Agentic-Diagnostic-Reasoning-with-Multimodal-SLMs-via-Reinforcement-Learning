                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with possible leukemia.  Evaluate for infectious
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Coarsened interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally are indicative
 of interstitial lung disease as seen on prior chest CT.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is stable.  Mediastinal contours are stable, including indentation/rightward
 shift of the lower trachea by the aortic arch.  Increase in density of the
 right lung base opacity may represent superimposed pneumonia.  No large
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased in density of the right lung base since the prior radiograph
 concerning for developing pneumonia superimposed on the chronic interstitial
 changes.
