                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin.  Question injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Coronary arteries are heavily calcified.  There is a
 moderate-to-large pleural effusion on the left, new since the prior study. 
 Associated left basilar atelectasis is likely.  Patchy right basilar opacity
 is not specific, but could be explained by atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 A moderate-to-severe upper thoracic wedge compression deformity appears
 unchanged.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic
 spine.  A new contour deformity of the left sixth rib is incompletely
 characterized, but apparently new; however the single image of it is more
 suggestive of prior than recent injury.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  New moderate-to-large left-sided pleural effusion; differential
 considerations include hemothorax.  
 
 2.  Contour abnormality of the left sixth rib fracture, not completely
 characterized but apparently new.  Dedicated left rib films may be helpful if
 acute injury is suspected to refer to this area, although the contour
 abnormality may be more chronic.
