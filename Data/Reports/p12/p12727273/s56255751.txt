                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and chest pain with EKG changes.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Coronary arteries
 appear calcified.
 The aortic arch is calcified.  There is mild upper zone redistribution of
 pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension without frank
 congestive heart failure.  The chest is hyperinflated to some degree.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A moderate mid-to-upper thoracic
 compression fracture is probably chronic.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary
 venous hypertension.
