                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Decreased lung volumes are noted with resultant crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Redemonstrated is stable, mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly with associated small, bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a
 subtle degree of left lower lobe volume loss, which likely represents
 atelectasis.  A right-sided PICC line is noted to terminate within the
 mid-lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Stable cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2. Left lower lobe volume loss, likely secondary to atelectasis.
 
 3. Right-sided PICC line is seen terminating within the mid to lower SVC.
