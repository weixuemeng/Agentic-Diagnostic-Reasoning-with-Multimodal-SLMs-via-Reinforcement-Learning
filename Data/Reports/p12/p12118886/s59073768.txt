                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, cirrhosis, fluid overload and
 worsening dyspnea despite antibiotics and diuresis  // ? fluid overload or
 progressive pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  A nasogastric
 tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized.  Multifocal airspace opacities,
 particularly in the perihilar locations and left lower lobe are most likely
 due to pulmonary edema.  The opacity at the left lung base may be due to
 atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No appreciable change in pulmonary edema or infection.  Persistent left lower
 lobe retrocardiac opacification may due to atelectasis, aspiration or
 pneumonia.
