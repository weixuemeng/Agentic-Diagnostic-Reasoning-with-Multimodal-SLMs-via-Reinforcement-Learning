                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, gi bleed and now fevers  // ngt
 placement and assess for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 328 ET TUBE TIP
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina at the level of the mid
 clavicular heads.  NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  Right
 IJ central line tip is in the distal most SVC, adjacent to the SVC/RA
 junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, with a small left pleural effusion.  There is
 atelectasis at the right lung base, with equivocal small effusion.
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier, there has been slight interval clearing at the
 left lung base laterally.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The possibility of a left
 base pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded, but the degree of opacification
 is slightly improved compared 1 day earlier.
 3. Minimal patchy opacity at the right base likely represents atelectasis and
 is similar to 1 day earlier.
