 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube traverses the diaphragm with tip not seen.  The right internal
 jugular venous catheter ends in the low SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are low,
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists and is overall unchanged. 
 Prominence of pulmonary vessels is also overall unchanged.  Moderate to mild
 pulmonary edema is probably also grossly unchanged when accounting for
