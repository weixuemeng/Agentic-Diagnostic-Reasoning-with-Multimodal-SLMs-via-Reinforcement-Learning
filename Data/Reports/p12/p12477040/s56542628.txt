                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:34 PM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with severe complicated C. difficile infection and
 increased abdominal distention.  Lactate is rising despite fluids, and
 increasing hypoxia and tachypnea raise possibility of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low, small right pleural effusion is present. 
 Mediastinal widening at the level of the thoracic aortic arch could be either
 venous engorgement or adenopathy.  Focal opacity at the base of the left lung
 is either atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, or left
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
