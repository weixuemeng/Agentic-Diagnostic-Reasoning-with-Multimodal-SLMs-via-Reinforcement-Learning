                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with asthmatic symptoms.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  The left lung is clear.  The
 assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrates linear atelectasis in the left
 lower lobe as well as most likely present atelectasis in the right middle
 lobe, both seen on PA and lateral views.  Although no focal consolidation
 demonstrated, infectious process is a possibility.
 
 Bilateral breast prosthesis project on both PA and lateral views.
