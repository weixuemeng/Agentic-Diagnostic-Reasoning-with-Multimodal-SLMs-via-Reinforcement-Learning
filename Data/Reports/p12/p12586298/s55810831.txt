                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Orthopnea and right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest ___ ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in
 the proximal right atrium, similar compared to the prior study.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size top normal. 
 The aorta remains tortuous.  Radiation fibrotic changes in the right upper
 lobe and superior mediastinal region is stable.  There is hyperexpansion of
 the lungs with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with underlying chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  No new areas of consolidation are
 demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Small hiatal hernia is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior exam.  No acute
 abnormality seen including no evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart
 failure.
