                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip is below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the
 film.  Heart size appears top normal.  The aorta is tortuous with mild
 calcification noted in the aortic arch.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Minimal linear opacities are noted in both lung bases likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube are in standard positions.
 
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
