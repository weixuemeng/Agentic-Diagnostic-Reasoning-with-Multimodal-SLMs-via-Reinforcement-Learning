                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hyponatremia.  Question pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are clear of focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.
 There is, however, asymmetric pleural thickening at the left lung apex. This
 is adjacent to a healed rib and clavicular fracture and likely related to
 prior trauma.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2) Asymteric pleural thickening at the left apex which is likely related to
 prior trauma given adjacent healed rib and clavicular fracture. However, if
 there is concern for a paraneoplastic process causing SIAD, this should be
 evaluated with chest CT.
