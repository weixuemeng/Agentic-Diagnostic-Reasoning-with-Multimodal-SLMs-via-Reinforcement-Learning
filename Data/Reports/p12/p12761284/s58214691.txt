                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation out pneumonia, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has performed a
 lesser inspiration than on the previous image.  As a consequence, there is
 crowding of the basal vascular bronchial structures.  However, no focal
 parenchymal opacity reflecting pneumonia is seen.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.  No pleural effusions.
