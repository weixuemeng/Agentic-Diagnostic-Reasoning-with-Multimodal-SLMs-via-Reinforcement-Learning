 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax. There is a smooth nondisplaced fracture through the anterior
 lateral aspect of the right fifth rib, possibly incomplete and probably
 unchanged since the prior study although better depicted on this one due to
 differences in orientation.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Prior incompletely healed
 right-sided rib fracture.
