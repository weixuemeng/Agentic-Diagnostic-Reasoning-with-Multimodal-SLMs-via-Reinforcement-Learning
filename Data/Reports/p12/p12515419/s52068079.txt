                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia, hypotension, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 Compared to the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 There may be slight upper zone redistribution, but no other evidence of CHF. 
 No focal consolidation or effusion.  Minimal patchy opacity at the left base
 is probably similar to the prior study.  Minimal atelectasis at the right
 base.  Surgical clips also noted at the right base.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt infiltrate.  Minimal patchy opacity at the left base is
 probably similar to ___.  If there is high concern for left lower lobe
 infectious infiltrate, then a lateral view may help for further assessment.
