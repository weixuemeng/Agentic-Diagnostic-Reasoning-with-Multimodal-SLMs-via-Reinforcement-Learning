                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS: The posterior costophrenic angles are sharp bilaterally.  On the PA
 view, the right costophrenic sulcus is less well defined than on the most
 recent study but relatively similar to an older radiograph.  Minimal
 peripheral parenchymal scarring is seen in this region of the lung, suggesting
 this may reflect focal parenchymal and pleural scarring.  Lungs and pleural
 surfaces are otherwise clear.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits and without change.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of a pleural effusion.  Focal right basilar scarring.
