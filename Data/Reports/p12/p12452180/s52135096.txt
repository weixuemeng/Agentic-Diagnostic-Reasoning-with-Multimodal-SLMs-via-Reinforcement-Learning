                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CML with pleural
 effusion, after drainage and still decreased breath sounds at the left
 posterior lung base.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval increase in pleural effusions from minimal to
 small-to-moderate on the current study with adjacent atelectasis.  Infectious
 process is less likely in association with pleural effusions but cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
