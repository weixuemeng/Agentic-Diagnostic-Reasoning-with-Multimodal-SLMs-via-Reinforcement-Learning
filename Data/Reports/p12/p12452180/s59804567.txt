                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain and dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low, limiting evaluation, with subtle opacity increased at the lower lungs
 likely representing bronchovascular crowding.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The heart is
 top normal in size.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  The bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacities in lower lungs in the setting of low lung
 volumes likely reflect bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.  Top normal
 heart size.
