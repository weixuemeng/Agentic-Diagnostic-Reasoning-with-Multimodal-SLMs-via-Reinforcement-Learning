                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, to evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The mid to upper mediastinum is
 enlarge and lobulated suggesting an aortic aneurysm although not entirely
 specific.  The heart size is normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear,
 without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Equivocal trace bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Enlarged mediastinal contours
 suggesting an aortic aneurysm.  Correlation with prior radiographs is
 recommended; particularly if none are available to show long-term stability of
 the appearance, then chest CT is recommended to evaluate further to confirm
 the etiology, exclude malignancy, and characterize a probable aneurysm.
