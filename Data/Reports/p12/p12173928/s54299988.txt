                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with diarrhea and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed without benefit of any prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heart is normal size.  Mitral annulus is extremely heavily calcified, which
 can contribute to mitral regurgitation, although I do not see vascular
 engorgement to suggest that.  The mild generalized interstitial abnormality
 could be chronic.  There is no pleural effusion.  Thoracic scoliosis is mild,
 but contributes to tortuosity of the heavily calcified thoracic aorta.
