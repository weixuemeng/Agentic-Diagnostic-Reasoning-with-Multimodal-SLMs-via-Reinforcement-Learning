                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a moderate right
 pleural effusion, but is likely mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and there is
 no definite hilar enlargement.  Right basilar opacification likely reflects a
 combination of moderate pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.  Small
 left pleural effusion is also demonstrated with minimal streaky retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  A catheter is seen coursing across
 the midline and terminating in the region of the right upper abdomen or lung
 base, but appears to have moved between the frontal and lateral views. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion with
 bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis.
