                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a lingering cough, who presents for
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. There is a small hiatal hernia. No definite new focal consolidations,
 pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces are seen.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 consistent with patient's known emphysema.  There is also bilateral pulmonary
 artery enlargement consistent with pulmonary hypertension, presumably a
 function of COPD, but stable since ___. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No definite acute interval changes to explain patient's lingering cough. 
 
 Since the patient's lower breasts are dense and may obscure small findings in
 the bases of the lungs, if there is a high clinical suspicion for pneumonia,
 would recommend additional oblique views for further evaluation.
 
 These findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 12:30pm by telephone on the day of the exam.
