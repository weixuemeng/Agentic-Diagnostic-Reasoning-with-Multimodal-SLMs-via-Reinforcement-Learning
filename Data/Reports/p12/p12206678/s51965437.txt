                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart size is normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contour is stable.  Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated with biapical attenuation of bronchovascular markings
 suggestive of emphysema/COPD.  A rounded lucent focus is again seen in the
 lateral view and likely represents a small hiatal hernia.  There is no
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is slight opacification of the posterior
 costophrenic recess which is stable since ___.  No acute bony abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Findings suggestive of emphysema/COPD.  Likely small hiatal hernia.
 2. Focal opacity projecting over the posterior costophrenic recess on the
 lateral view which is stable however given the history of chronic cough and
 COPD, nonemergent dedicated chest CT can be obtained for further evaluation.
