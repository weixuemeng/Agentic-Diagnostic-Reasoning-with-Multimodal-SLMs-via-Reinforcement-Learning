                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  COPD and worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is again a small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.  The chest is hyperinflated.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Irregularity of the
 bronchovascular architecture is consistent with emphysema.  Streaky opacities
 along the left hemidiaphragm and lingula suggest minor atelectasis.  Though
 pneumonia is doubted, if symptoms were to persist or if there is other
 clinical concern for the possibility of developing pneumonia, short-term
 follow-up radiographs may be useful.
