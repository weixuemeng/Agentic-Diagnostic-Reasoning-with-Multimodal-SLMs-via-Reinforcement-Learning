                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysematous changes again noted. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with a small hiatal
 hernia again noted.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased
 interstitial markings in the lung bases appear slightly increased compared to
 the prior chest radiograph, particularly in the right lung base, with
 associated bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening compatible with an
 airways inflammatory or infectious process.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right, with
 associated bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening.  Findings are
 concerning for acute on chronic bronchial inflammation and/or infection
 including ___ or aspiration.
