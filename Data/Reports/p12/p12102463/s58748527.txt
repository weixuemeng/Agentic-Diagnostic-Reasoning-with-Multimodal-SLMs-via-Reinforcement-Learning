 Compared to chest radiographs since ___:02:
 
 Volume loss in the lower lobes, previously collapse on the left, has improved
 bilaterally, revealing bilateral consolidation, large on the left, moderate on
 the right, strongly suggesting aspiration pneumonia.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion has improved slightly.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Dual channel dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium, ET tube in standard
 placement, and transesophageal drainage tube still looped in the stomach.  The
 tip of a probe or small catheter projects to the left of the midline in the

 an intended esophageal manometry probe it needs to be advanced into the chest.
