                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with delirium  // r/o pneumonia      r/o
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 12:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity with suggestion of air bronchograms favors
 aspiration or pneumonia rather than atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  Right medial basilar patchy opacity more consistent with
 atelectasis in the setting of an elevated right hemidiaphragm and decreased
 lung volume.  Right internal jugular large bore catheter unchanged in position
 with its tip terminating in the right atrium.  Left subclavian PICC line has
 its tip in the distal subclavian vein prior to the confluence with the SVC. 
 No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable given differences in patient rotation.
