 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p hartmans with sepsis, and resp distress,
 s/p bronch and BAL sampling, removed L IJ  // assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior exams, mild progression of opacifications are seen in the
 right lower lung, concerning for pneumonia.  Mild vascular congestion is also
 increased compared to prior study.   Interval removal of left-sided internal
 jugular central venous line.  An endotracheal tube is seen terminating 2.7 cm
 above the carina.  A tunneled dialysis catheter on the right is unchanged
 compared to prior same day exams.  Enteric tube is coiled in the stomach.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 pneumonia.
 2. Mild increase in vascular congestion compared to prior study.
 3. Interval removal of left-sided internal jugular approach central venous
 line.
 4. Stable appearance of ETT, tunneled dialysis catheter, and enteric tube.
