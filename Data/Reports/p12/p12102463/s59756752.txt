  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and patchy diffuse infiltrates are
  consistent with fluid overload.

  Bilateral patchy infiltrates in the appropriate clinical setting could
  represent pneumonia, more likely viral.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o chf and now perforated viscous, known
 intraabdominal free air  // please evaluate for any acute intrathoracic
 process, preop eval Surg: ___ (possible laparotomy)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right central venous line ends in the region of the right atrium. Lung
 volumes are low.  There is no pneumothorax.  No free air is seen below
 hemidiaphragms.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is accompanied by signs of mild volume overload.  Patchy
 and linear right basilar opacity adjacent to mildly elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is probably due to atelectasis.  Lucency in right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen corresponds to free intraperitoneal air on CT abdomen of
 ___, in keeping with history of perforated viscus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild fluid overload.
