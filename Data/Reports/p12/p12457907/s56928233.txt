                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness.  R/o pna.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is post right upper lobectomy, with expected postsurgical changes and
 right lung volume loss.  There is subtle increased density in the right lower
 lung which may in part reflect the presence of scarring and right breast
 implant, however in early pneumonia difficult to exclude in the correct
 clinical setting.  Underlying emphysema is noted.  Heart size is top normal. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right upper lobectomy.  Subtle increased opacity in the right
 lower lung maybe due to scarring and right breast implant though difficult to
 exclude an underlying pneumonia.
