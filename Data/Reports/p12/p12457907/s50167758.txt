 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right upper lobectomy, to assess

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is status post right upper
 lobectomy.  The previously noted right pneumothorax has resolved. Trace right
 pleural effusion is present.  The right chest wall emphysema has improved. 
 Small lucencies overlying the right lateral chest persist, and likely
 represent residual chest wall emphysema from prior chest tube placement.   The
 left lung is well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved right pneumothorax and chest wall emphysema.
