 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation with palpitations.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 There is a generalized increase in the interstitial markings, as seen on the
 prior radiograph from ___, likely mild interstitial edema. 
 Heterogeneous bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis or infection.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is increased.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema. 
 
 2.  Heterogeneous bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis versus infection. 
 Clinical correlation recommended.
