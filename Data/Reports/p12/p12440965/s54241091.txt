                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is present. The aorta is diffusely
 calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. There
 is mild upper zone vascular redistribution with increased interstitial
 markings compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted. No focal consolidation  or pneumothorax is
 present. There is evidence of prior vertebroplasty within a vertebral body at
 the thoracolumbar junction.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 throughout the thoracic spine. An inferior vena cava filter is partially
 imaged within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
