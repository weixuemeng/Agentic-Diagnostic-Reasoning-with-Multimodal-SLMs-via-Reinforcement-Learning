                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dizziness.  Evaluate for cardiac

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The patient
 is rotated. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct, which may be due to very mild
 pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with tortuous
 aorta and top normal size heart.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified. 
 Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is similar to prior studies.  There
 is no free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. No pneumonia or pleural effusion.
