 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the heart size which is mild likely
 enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal atelectasis is demonstrated in the lung bases. 
 Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are visualized. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are also seen in the thoracic spine.
