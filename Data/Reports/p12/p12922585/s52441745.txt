                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough, ?dx of pna recently  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is obscuration of the right cardiac margin.  Pectus deformity is noted
 on the lateral view.  On the lateral view, there is slightly increased density
 projecting over the right middle lobe region potentially due to superimposed
 breast tissue.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia or large effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is otherwise unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Loss of the right cardiac margin potentially due to patient's pectus deformity
 noting that focal infection is not entirely excluded given slightly increased
 density on the lateral view.
