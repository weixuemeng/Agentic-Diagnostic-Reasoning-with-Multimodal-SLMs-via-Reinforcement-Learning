                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New onset of atrial fibrillation and bilateral crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged particularly the left
 atrium.  The aortic arch is calcified with mild unfolding of the descending
 aorta.  An eventration of the anterior right hemidiaphragm appears unchanged. 
 The chest is probably hyperinflated to some extent.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lung fields demonstrate a very mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting slight vascular congestion, but without
 focal opacification.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
