                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:50 A.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with hypoxic respiratory failure, now extubated. 
 Probable chest compressions.  Other rib fractures?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, most recently 4:48 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes are lower.  Severe bilateral perihilar pulmonary consolidation
 has worsened on the left, improved on the right.  Heart is larger, and
 mediastinal veins are more dilated.  Findings point to acute cardiac
 decompensation in the setting of a possible acute myocardial infarction or
 papillary muscle rupture or other cause of acute mitral regurgitation, now
 spreading to right heart dysfunction.
 
 Pleural effusions are presumed but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.
