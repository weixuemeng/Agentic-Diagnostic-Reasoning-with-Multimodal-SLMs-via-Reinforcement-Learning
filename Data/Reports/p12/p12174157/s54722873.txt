                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest pain after fall.  Evaluation
 for rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear, with no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  No displaced rib fractures are identified.  Chronic-appearing
 irregularity of the bilateral acromioclavicular joints is likely not related
 to acute trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. No displaced rib fracture
 identified.
