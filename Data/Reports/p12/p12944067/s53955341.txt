                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size and appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 structures.  At the base of the right lung, seen on the frontal radiograph
 only, is a zone of minimally increased opacity that does not fulfill the
 typical appearance of an infectious lesion.  The radiographic appearance is
 likely to be caused by an overlay of ribs.  The change has no correlate on the
 lateral image.  No pneumothorax.
