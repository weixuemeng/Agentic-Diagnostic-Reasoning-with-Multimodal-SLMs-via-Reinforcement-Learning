                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with sepsis and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates left internal jugular central
 venous catheter projecting over left brachiocephalic vein.  Dialysis catheter
 tip projects over mid SVC.
 
 Low lung volumes.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  Right costophrenic
 angle is not fully imaged.  Left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of
 pleural effusion.  Left retrocardiac consolidation is noted.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is difficult to assess
 due to adjacent opacities.  Right hemidiaphragm is elevated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema with low lung volumes and likely
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over the
 expected location of the brachiocephalic vein, but cannot excluded arterial
 placement. 
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:45pm ___ by phone.
