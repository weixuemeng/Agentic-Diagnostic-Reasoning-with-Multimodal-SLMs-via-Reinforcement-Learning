                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  History of non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, the right lung masses have
 increased in size.  For example, the central superior mass previously measured
 5.1 cm.  It now measures 6.6 cm.  A large mass at the right base is also
 increased in size.  It previously measured 7.1 cm and now measures ___.8 cm.  A
 third mass in the right mid lung zone appears stable.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no left pleural effusion.  A right pleural
 effusion cannot be assessed for due to the large mass.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in size of multiple right lung masses, consistent with
 metastatic disease progression of known non-small cell lung cancer. Please
 refer to same day CT chest for additional details.
