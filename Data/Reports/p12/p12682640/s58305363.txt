                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  A patchy and linear area of
 opacity is present in the lingula, and is new compared to recent CT of ___.  At that time, the conducting airways to this region were normal in
 appearance with no evidence of obstructing airway lesions.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy and linear lingular opacities are most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Short-term followup radiograph could be considered to ensure
 resolution if warranted clinically.
