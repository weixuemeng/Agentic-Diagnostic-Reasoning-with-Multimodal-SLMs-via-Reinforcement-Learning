                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, tachypnea  // repeat eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 17:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Since the prior exam, there is
 apparent progression of pulmonary edema. Interval increase in lower lung
 opacities raises concern for pneumonia versus aspiration. Cardiomegaly is
 unchanged with subtle retrocardiac opacity which is consistent with known
 hiatal hernia. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent worsening of pulmonary edema. Difficult to exclude a superimposed
 pneumonia or aspiration at the lung bases.
