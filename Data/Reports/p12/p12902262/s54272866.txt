                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ?retrocardiac opacity on chest x-ray,
 hypoxemia, motion artifact  // pneumonia? mass? edema?
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Again
 demonstrated is a hiatal hernia. New patchy and linear right basilar opacity
 is most likely due to atelectasis.  Questionable area of abnormal increased
 opacity in the right paramediastinal region may be due to superimposition of
 structures, but attention to this region on the standard PA and lateral chest
 radiograph prior to discharge is recommended to exclude a pneumonia or mass.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___ chest radiograph.
