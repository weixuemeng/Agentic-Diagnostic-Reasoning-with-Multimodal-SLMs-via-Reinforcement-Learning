                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with multiple falls  // R/O CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral views.  The lateral view is suboptimal due to
 overlying motion artifact.
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful to
 detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiac enlargement which may reflect cardiomegaly or a
 pericardial effusion. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Thehilar and mediastinal contours difficult to assess given
 marked patient rotation on the current study.  There is likely a hiatal
 hernia. There may be a focal opacity in the retrocardiac region; however
 evaluation is limited due to patient rotation and motion artifact. Followup
 imaging may be prudent. No large effusions are seen.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated. No acute bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Limited examination due to marked patient rotation and overlying motion
 artifact on the lateral view. Cardiac enlargement which may reflect
 cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Probable hiatal hernia. No definite
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Followup imaging would be prudent. .
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___ d/w Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 5:___p on the day of
 the exam by phone.
