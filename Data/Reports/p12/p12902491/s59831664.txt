                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post V-fib arrest with trach and PEG in place, here to
 evaluate position of lines and tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube projects over the trachea in appropriate
 position on this single view.  A left pectoral pacemaker with a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricle is present.  The inspiratory lung volumes
 are decreased.  There is opacification of the right lower lung zone obscuring
 the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm, suggesting a small right
 pleural effusion.  There is probable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 air-filled colon projecting over the expected right lung base.  The left lung
 is relatively clear with streaky retrocardiac opacification most compatible
 with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated due to right basilar opacification but is likely mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are prominent in part related to unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  The aortic knob is partially calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion with possible elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and air-filled colon projecting over the expected right lung
 base beneath the elevated hemidiaphragm.
