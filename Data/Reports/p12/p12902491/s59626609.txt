                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of coronary artery disease and CHF status post PEA arrest
 treated with coiling and rewarming currently on mechanical ventilation, here
 to evaluate for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph was performed on ___ at 08:07. 
 
 Technique:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with a single lead terminating in the
 right ventricular apex.  A tracheostomy tube is in place.  There is bi apical
 capping on the right greater than left, which may represent pleural fluid.  A
 moderate sized layering right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis is
 slightly decreased in size.  A small left pleural effusion and associated
 atelectasis is slightly decreased in size.  Improved aeration of the bilateral
 lung bases may also reflect differences in position between studies with more
 dependent pleural fluid on today's examination.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated.  The mediastinal contours
 are prominent but stable with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and
 calcification of the aortic knob.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal change with persistent bilateral pleural effusions on the right
 greater than left and underlying atelectasis.
