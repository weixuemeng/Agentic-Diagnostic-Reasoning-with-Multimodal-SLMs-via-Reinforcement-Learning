                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain, recent pleural effusion  //
 infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___ as well as chest radiograph dated
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable allowing for lower lung
 volumes.  Streaky opacity at the right lung base reflects atelectasis. 
 Opacity within the right medial lower lung zone may be atelectatic in etiology
 though infectious process is difficult to exclude.  Bronchovascular crowding
 is noted.  There is no evidence of over pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No
 large pleural effusion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect
 trace pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with associated bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.  A
 equivocal opacity within the right medial lower lung zone for which infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded.
