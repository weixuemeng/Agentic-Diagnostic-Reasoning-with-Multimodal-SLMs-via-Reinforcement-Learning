 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  New atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The aortic arch is again calcified.  The
 lungs appear clear aside from linear right mid lung opacity suggesting minor
 atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  Mild hyperinflation is
 noted.  There is exaggerated kyphotic curvature with slight loss in several
 mid vertebral body heights.  Bones are likely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
