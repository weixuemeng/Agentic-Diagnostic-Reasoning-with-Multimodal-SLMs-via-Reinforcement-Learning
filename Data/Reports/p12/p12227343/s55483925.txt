                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Generalized weakness and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest show a pacemaker in place with
 the wires in proper position in the right atrium and left ventricle.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is mild tortuosity of the aorta.  There is
 mild hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened hemi-diaphragms suggesting
 underlying chronic lung disease.  Prominent coarse interstitial markings could
 also represent underlying chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous
 pressures, or both.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The spine is osteoporotic with evidence of a prior kyphoplasty
 in the mid thoracic spine.  There are vertebral compression fractures of
 unknown chronicity in the two vertebral bodies superior to the prior
 kyphoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Coarse interstitial markings may represent chronic lung disease, elevated
 pulmonary pressures, or both.
 3.  Multiple vertebral compression fractures in the mid thoracic spine of
 unknown chronicity.
