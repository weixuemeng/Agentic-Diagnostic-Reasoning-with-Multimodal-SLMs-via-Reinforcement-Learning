 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA, with worsening WBC  // r/o worsening
 pna      r/o worsening pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 There has been substantial increase in an opacification bilaterally,
 presenting a pattern consistent with pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac
 opacification probably reflects volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 The right heart border is again not well seen. In the appropriate clinical
 setting, an area of pneumonia or even multifocal consolidations would have to
 be considered.
