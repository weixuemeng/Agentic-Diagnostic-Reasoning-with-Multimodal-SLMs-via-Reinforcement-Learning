                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent multifocal pna/flu who p/w GI bleed
 now with worsening cough.  // r/o new process     r/o new process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change. 
 The patient has taken a much better inspiration, which probably is responsible
 for the apparent improvement of pulmonary opacifications since the study of 7
 hr previously.
 Again, the descending aorta is not well seen on the frontal view. On the
 lateral projection, there is some opacification overlying the lower thoracic
 vertebra. Although this could merely reflect vascular structures, in the
 appropriate clinical setting a developing consolidation could be considered.
