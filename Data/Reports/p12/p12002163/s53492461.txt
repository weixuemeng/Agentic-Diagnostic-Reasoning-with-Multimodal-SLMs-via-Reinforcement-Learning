                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old woman with a recent pneumonia/ flu, now with
 leukocytosis, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior studies, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable,
 within normal limits. The bilateral hila are normal. There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, improved since prior studies. Streaky perihilar opacities
 and diffuse interstitial prominence is somewhat improved since the prior
 radiographs, consistent with residual pneumonia. There may be a component of
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema. There are trace bilateral pleural
 effusions. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild lower thoracic
 levoscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent though improved streaky perihilar opacities likely reflect
 residual pneumonia. Possible mild superimposed pulmonary edema.
 2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
