                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ obtained at an outside
 hospital.  CT chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the right upper lung zone, there is an ill-defined dense opacity
 which correlates to the nodular opacity seen on the prior CT.  In comparison
 to the prior chest radiograph from ___, it appears slightly less
 apparent, but that may be due to patient positioning.  Compared to the prior
 chest radiograph from ___, it is not changed.  The remainder of
 the lung fields is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lung zone opacity.  Given the appearance, it is
 concerning for a possible mass.  Alternatively, it could be due to continued
 infection.  Continued followup is recommended.  Chest CT pending.
