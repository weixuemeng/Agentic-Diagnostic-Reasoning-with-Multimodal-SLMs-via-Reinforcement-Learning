                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ESRD on dialysis presenting with weakness,
 hypertension, in setting of missing 2 dialysis sessions. Wheezing on exam.
 Denies shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contours are similar.  Low lung volumes results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No frank
 pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is noted.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
