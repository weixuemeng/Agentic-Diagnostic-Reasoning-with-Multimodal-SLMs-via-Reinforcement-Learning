                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increasing shortness of breath in a patient with
 advanced ovarian cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at
 the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion noted.  There are diffuse interstitial markings which appear
 to be more pronounced than on the prior study.  They might potentially
 represent mild interstitial pulmonary edema, but lymphangitic spread of tumor
 involving the lungs cannot be excluded.  If clinically warranted, correlation
 with chest CT might be considered.
