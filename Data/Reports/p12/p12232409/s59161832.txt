 HISTORY:  Dermatomyositis presenting with syncope, chest pain, and shortness
 of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  1.9 cm right lower lung nodular
 opacity is best seen on the frontal view.  No substantial interstitial
 abnormality.  No focal lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 1.9 cm right lower lung nodular opacity is concerning for lung
 malignancy.  Nonemergent dedicated chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
