                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and sweats.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No definite pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  On the frontal view, there is the vague
 suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base, though this
 overlaps a rib and is not definitely appreciated on the lateral projection. 
 Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of this
 reflecting an early pneumonia would have to be considered.
