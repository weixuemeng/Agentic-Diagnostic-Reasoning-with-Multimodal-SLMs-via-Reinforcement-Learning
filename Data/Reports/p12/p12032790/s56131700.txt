                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with aortobifemoral bypass, aortic occlusion fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lung opacities with upper lobe predominance has slightly worsened
 and has fluctuated overtime since a few days. This is probably pulmonary edema
 considering its rapid evolution; however, it is unusual that the lower lungs
 are spared.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has resolved.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Slight worsening of moderate pulmonary edema.
