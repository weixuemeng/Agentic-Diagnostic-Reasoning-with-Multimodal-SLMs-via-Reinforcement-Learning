                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, to assess for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are diffuse areas of
 increased opacification in the mid zones bilaterally with some involvement of
 the upper zone on the right.  Although this could represent fluid overload, in
 the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
