                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation of the chest prior to vascular surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portables semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is relative opacification at the right lung apex compared to
 the left.  The remainder of both lungs are well aerated without focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  The trachea is likely slightly deviated to the left in the
 upper mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Deviation of the superior trachea.  Following surgery, this may be further
 evaluated with PA and lateral radiographs.
