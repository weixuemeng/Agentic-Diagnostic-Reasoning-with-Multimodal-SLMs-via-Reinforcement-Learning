                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of rib fractures, pain and
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again identified are multiple left-sided rib fractures with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again noted and
 most prominent at the left base.  As a result, an overlying pneumonia must be
 excluded in the proper clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
