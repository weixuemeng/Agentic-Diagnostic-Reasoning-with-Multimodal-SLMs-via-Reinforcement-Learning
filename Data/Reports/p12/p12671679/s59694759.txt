                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma with fall on to the left side.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are
 several rib fractures without evidence of pneumothorax.  Atelectatic changes
 are seen at both bases, increasingly more prominent on the left.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is again seen on the frontal view.
