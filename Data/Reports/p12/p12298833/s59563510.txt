                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes
 with elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour.  Pulmonary vasculature
 now appears to be essentially within normal limits.  PICC line remains in
 place, though the Dobbhoff tube has been removed.
