                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increasing dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance, normal.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, no
 appreciable abnormality to explain patient's symptoms is demonstrated within
 the limitations of the study technique.
 
 Questionable increase in both hila that potentially might represent pulmonary
 hypertension is noted, but correlation with echocardiography is recommended
 since this finding is re-demonstrated on the current chest radiograph.
