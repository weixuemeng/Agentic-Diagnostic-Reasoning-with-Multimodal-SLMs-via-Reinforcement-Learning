                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Critical AS, AFib, question pneumonia on prior chest x-ray.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:08 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the degree of vascular plethora is slightly
 greater. Opacity at the right base is also somewhat greater.  This appears to
 represent a combination of a small-to-moderate pleural effusion as well as
 some parenchymal opacity.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with
 small left effusion again seen.  Marked cardiomegaly is again noted. As
 before, given the marked cardiomegaly and bottle-like configuration, the
 possibility of a pericardial fluid component cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Cardiomegaly and findings consistent with pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
 effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Findings are
 slightly worse compared with the prior film, as detailed above.  
 
 2) The possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
