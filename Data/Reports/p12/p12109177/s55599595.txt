 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Single supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates a malpositioned

 terminating in the pharynx, and directed inferiorly.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates just above the level of the clavicular heads, approximately 7.2 cm

 ideal positioning.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac opacity may be secondary to
 atelectasis, but lungs are otherwise clear of effusion, consolidation, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The stomach is distended with air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned nasogastric tube, and high position of the
 endotracheal tube, as described above.
