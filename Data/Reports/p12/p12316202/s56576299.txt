                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is a large right pneumothorax with collapse of the right lung.  There may be
 slight widening of the right rib interspaces and minimal downward displacement
 of the right hemidiaphragm which could represent very minimal tension. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal structures are relatively midline.  The left lung
 is clear.
