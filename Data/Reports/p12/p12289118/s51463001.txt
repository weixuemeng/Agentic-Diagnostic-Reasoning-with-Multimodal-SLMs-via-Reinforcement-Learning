                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Two portable frontal views of the chest initially show a
 consolidation within the left lung which immediately clears on repeat imaging,
 suggesting atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lung volumes are low, which accentuates the bronchovascular structures.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
