                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe rhonchi.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:

 localized bronchitis, perhaps a very mild, presumably viral, bronchopneumonia.
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal, hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal.
 
 ___ and I discussed these findings and their clinical
 significance.
