                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall in the setting of alcohol intoxication.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated suggesting emphysema. Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  No chf, focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. There is vague focal opacity
 over the right lung base laterally. Based on the lateral view, this appears to
 be due to an anterior fat pad, rather than a lung contusion.  Old healed left
 rib and left clavicular fractures are noted. Mild thoracic spine degenerative
 change noted. No t-spine vertebral body compression fracture or obvious acute
 rib fracture is detected on this lung-technique film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Hyperinflated lungs suggest emphysema. 
 
 2) Suspect fat pad accounting for vague opacity at right lung base -- please
 see comment above.  If this corresponds to a site of symptoms, then follow-up
 radiographs to assess for any interval change would be recommended.
