                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of smoking, restrictive PFTs, CAD,
 with shortness of breath, cough, recent bronchitis  // any infiltrates or
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No acute focal consolidation.  Chronic linear opacity along the right heart
 border, suggestive of right middle lobe partial volume loss.  Nodular
 opacities projecting between the sixth and seventh interspace on the left
 appears more conspicuous since ___.  The mediastinum is widened.  The
 trachea is deviated to the right.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications and tortuosity of the descending aorta.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   No acute pneumonia.  Multiple nodular opacities in the left lung can be
 calcified granulomas or noncalcified pulmonary nodules and are incompletely
 assessed.
 
 2. Chronic linear opacity along right middle lobe can be right middle lobe
 volume loss, also incompletely assessed.
 
 3.  Widened mediastinum and trachea shifted to the right likely related to
 enlargement of the thyroid
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A CT of the thorax is suggested to assess for pulmonary
 nodules, thyroid and right middle lobe.
