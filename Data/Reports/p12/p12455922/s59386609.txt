                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GOLD II COPD with bronchitis in ___
 now much better, assess for any worsening of previously noted chronic changes.
 // any change in previously noted atelectatic changes     any change in
 previously noted atelectatic changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lungs are still hyperinflated suggesting emphysema or small airway
 obstruction.  At least one irregular 11 mm nodule projecting over the left
 third rib requires chest CT evaluation to see if it is calcified.  There may
 be additional nodules, difficult to separate from the anterior costal
 calcifications.
 
 Heart size is normal, decreased since the prior study.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged and there is no edema or pleural effusion.  Lateral view shows
 considerable atherosclerotic calcification in the aorta and at the origin of
 head neck vessels.
 
 As before, the trachea trachea is displaced to the right and posteriorly by a
 a large left pretracheal mass, most commonly thyroid.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to evaluate pulmonary nodules.
 
 Clinical evaluation of the significance of a possible large left goiter or
 other while are other cervicothoracic mass.
