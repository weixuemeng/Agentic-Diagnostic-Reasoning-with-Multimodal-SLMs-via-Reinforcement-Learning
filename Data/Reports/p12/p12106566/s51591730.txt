                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, fever  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Right basilar opacity is linear consistent with
 atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lung is not
 well-visualized on lateral view.  There is vascular congestion without overt
 edema.  Mediastinal contours and hila are normal.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged and the aorta is calcified. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis and overlying soft tissue
 rather than pneumonia.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
