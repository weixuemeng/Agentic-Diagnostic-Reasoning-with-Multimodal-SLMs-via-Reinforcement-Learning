 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 11:47 AM
  1.  Probable multilobar pneumonia of the right lung, stable from two days ago
  and much improved from ___.
  2.  A focal component of pneumonia versus pleural effusion tracking into the
  fissure on the right.  Oblique views may help differentiate the two
  possibilities
  3.  Stable congestive heart failure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CHF and possible pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The diffuse heterogeneous opacification of
 the right lung with a denser perifissural component at the inferior upper lobe
 is unchanged from the prior study but considerably improved from ___.  The left lung is clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular
 engorgement is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Possible small bilateral
 pleural effusions appear unchanged from two days ago. A right PICC terminates
 in the mid SVC and is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable multilobar pneumonia of the right lung, stable from two days ago
 and much improved from ___.
 2.  A focal remaining component of pneumonia versus pleural effusion tracking
 into the fissures on the right.  Oblique views may help differentiate the two
 possibilities.
 3.  Stable congestive heart failure.
