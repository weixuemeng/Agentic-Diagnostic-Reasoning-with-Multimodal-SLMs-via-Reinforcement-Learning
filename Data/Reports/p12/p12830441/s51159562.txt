                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe right rib pain.  Evaluate for rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and
 normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Normal appearance of the heart and lungs.  No pneumothorax.
 2. No rib fracture is identified.  However, this is a particularly insensitive
 test for the detection of subtle rib fractures.  If there is continued
 clinical concern, a dedicated rib series with a skin marker at the location of
 the patient's pain is recommended.
