                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress, now intubated  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest exam examination from ___ at ___ rotated
 positioning.
 
 An ET tube is in place, tip 4.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
 tip and probably also side-port the on the GE junction.  Right IJ central line
 tip most likely overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well delineated, but is probably
 unchanged.
 
 Opacity at the right base is overall similar to the prior study and could
 represent a combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Small right
 effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 There is subsegmental atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base, similar to
 prior.  No gross left-sided effusion.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.
 
 Linear opacity traversing the upper left chest probably represents artifact
 such as a soft tissue fold.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as described.
 2. Mild CHF, may be slightly more pronounced.
 3. Right base opacity is overall similar to the prior study.  The possibility
 that this represents an aspiration pneumonia was raised on the ___
 CT scan.
 4. Left base subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring is unchanged.
 5. Small right effusion would be difficult to exclude.
 6. The left upper lobe spiculated nodule identified on the ___
 chest CT , which raise concern for neoplasm, is not well visualized by
 radiograph.
