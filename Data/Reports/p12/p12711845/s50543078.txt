                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ hx COPD on 3L home O2, incidentally found spiculated lung
 nodule, in the hospital for lower back pain w/ sudden onset tachycardia,
 tachypnea, and respiratory distress.  // Eval for interval change after
 extubation
 
 COMPARISON:  With the prior study, ET and NG tubes have been removed.  A right
 IJ central line remains present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 Again seen is patchy prominent patchy opacity at the right lung base. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is better seen on the current exam due to lack of patient
 rotation, but is probably unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, but
 doubt overt CHF.  Allowing for differences in positioning, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  No gross effusion
 identified.  Small right effusion would be difficult to entirely exclude.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET and NG tube have been removed.
 
 Otherwise, allowing for differences in positioning, doubt significant interval
 change.  Persistent opacities at the right greater than left bases again
 noted.
