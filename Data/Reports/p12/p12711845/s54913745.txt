                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea , history of COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Fiducial
 marker is noted within a left upper lobe spiculated nodule which was better
 assessed on the previous CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 opacities are seen in the lung bases, improved from previous examinations,
 more pronounced on the right and likely reflective of atelectasis.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen, although the medial lung apices are obscured by the patient's neck. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
