                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is out of below the diaphragm. 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal.  Bibasilar opacities
 are grossly unchanged.  These are most likely due to aspiration/pneumonia. 
 The component of pulmonary edema has improved.  If any, there is a small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 The apparent increase in the consolidation in the right lower lobe is due to
 lower lung volumes.
