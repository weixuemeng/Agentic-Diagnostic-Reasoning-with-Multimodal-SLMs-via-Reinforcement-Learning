                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VAP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a suggestion of
 increased opacification at the left base, though this is difficult to assess
 due to overlying external devices.  This could be an area of focal
 consolidation.
 
 Remainder of the study is essentially within normal limits with tracheostomy
 tube and central catheter remaining in place.
