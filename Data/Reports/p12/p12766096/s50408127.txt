                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip being approximately 5.2 cm above
 the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 essentially clear except for left infrahilar opacity, that appears to be more
 pronounced than on the prior study and potentially might reflect developing
 infectious process, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is
 recommended.
