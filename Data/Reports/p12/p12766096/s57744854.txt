                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute cocaine and narcotic intoxication and
 unresponsiveness, intubated at outside hospital.  Question edema or
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference radiograph dated ___ at 11:05 a.m. from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending 5.1
 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube has tip in the stomach and side port
 just below the GE junction.  Since preceding exam, there are new prominent
 bilateral infrahilar peribronchovascular opacities, given short interval,
 could represent aspiration pneumonitis versus pulmonary edema.  Perihilar
 vascular markings are prominent, but azygous distention is less prominent on
 current radiograph as compared to the preceding exam.  The upper lungs are
 well aerated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis
 is noted, likely atelectasis.  A small effusion on the left cannot be
 excluded.  Note is  made of relatively increased lucency in the left
 costophrenic angle with inferior extension raising question of a basal
 pneumothorax versus summation artifact, which could be correlated with lateral
 view once able.  The cardiac size is normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Short-interval development of bilateral predominantly infrahilar
 peribronchovascular opacities, which could represent aspiration pneumonitis
 versus pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increased lucency in the left costophrenic region could represent a
 summation artifact, although a basal pneumothorax cannot be excluded and could
 be correlated with lateral view once able.
 
 3.  Appropriate positioning of ET tube and enteric tube.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ at 3 p.m. via phone on ___.
