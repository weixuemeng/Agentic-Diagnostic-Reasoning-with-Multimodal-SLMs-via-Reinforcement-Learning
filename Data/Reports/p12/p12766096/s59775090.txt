 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___ at 14:14 and ___ at 04:08 .
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: ET tube is approximately 5.3 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube is noted with side port within the expected region
 of the stomach.  Bilateral basilar opacities may represent aspiration
 pneumonitis versus pulmonary edema.  This was noted to to improved on the
 right and persist on the left on the chest radiograph obtained approximately 7

 findings may represent pulmonary edema on the right which has improved
 (correlate with history of diuresis) and aspiration pneumonitis versus
 pneumonia on the left.
