                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and persistent chest
 wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest were obtained with the patient
 in the upright position.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Previously
 visualized pleural effusions have now resolved.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The heart is of normal size and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence for acute thoracic process.  Orthopedic
 hardware is noted in the cervical spine, unchanged from previous exam. 
 Sternotomy wires appear unchanged from previous exam.  The other visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiograph.  If chest wall pain can be
 localized, specific imaging exam of the sternum could be considered.
