                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with PICC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided PICC line has been pulled back and now ends in the lower SVC. 
 Mild pulmonary edema has slightly redistributed not changed significantly and
 severity. Left lung base is now more lucent with an unusual round shape, this
 could only be spared lungs, however close attention to this area on follow up
 is suggested.
 Right basilar opacification has worsened, probably from pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC line has been pulled back and is in adequate position.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged in severity.
 3.  Increase in left lower lung hyperlucency could be from reaerated lung,
 however close attention to this area on follow up is suggested.
