                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly appears increased compared to the prior exam.  Aorta
 remains tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases are noted, more so on the right, possibly reflective of
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration is difficult to exclude.  Possible
 trace left pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
