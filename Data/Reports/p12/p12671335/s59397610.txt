                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 poor inspiration, accounting for the apparent increase in transverse diameter
 of the heart.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  This discordancy suggests
 underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 Increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  There probably is
 also a small effusion at the right base.
