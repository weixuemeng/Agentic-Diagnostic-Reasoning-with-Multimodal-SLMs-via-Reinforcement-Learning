                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and sputum production.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged. There are patchy opacities in both lower lungs, including
 within the lingula and right lower lobe, possibly the left lower lobe as well.
 These could be seen with pneumonia but more generally, there is also a mild
 interstitial abnormality suggestive of interstitial edema.  A trace pleural
 effusion is suspected on the right.  Fissures are thickened.  Bones are not
 well assessed but no abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities in the lower lungs that could be seen seen with
 pneumonia but also with a background mild interstitial abnormality.  This
 interstitial abnormality may be due to coinciding mild interstitial edema or
 potentially infection.
