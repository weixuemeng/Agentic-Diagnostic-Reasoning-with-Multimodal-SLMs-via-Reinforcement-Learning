                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metabolic encephalopathy,
 hypothermia.  Study requested to rule out right middle lobe infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is enlarged and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. Increased
 opacification at the left lung base is consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe and effusion.  There is an increased opacification at the right
 lower lobe, seen in the frontal view but not appreciated on the lateral view.
 There is a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly with no vascular congestion raises the possibility of
 underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 2.  Increased density in right lower lobe, not appreciated on the lateral
 view.  In the appropriate clinical setting, may suggest pneumonia.
