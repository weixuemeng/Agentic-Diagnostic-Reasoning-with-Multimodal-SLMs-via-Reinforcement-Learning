                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  Poorly defined
 opacities in the left mid and lower lung are new, superimposed on pre-existing
 linear scarring.  Left hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated compared to the
 right.  There is no pneumothorax, but left apex is obscured by overlying soft
 tissue structures of the chin and neck, precluding assessment for left apical
 pneumothorax or parenchymal process in this region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Poorly defined left mid and lower lung opacities could
 reflect atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia.  Standard PA and
 lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for more complete assessment of
 these findings when the patient's condition permits.  .
