                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea on exertion, wheezing and
 lower extremity edema, evaluate for pulmonary effusion and congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.
 The configuration suggests a prominence of the left ventricular contour to the
 left and posteriorly, but there is no marked left atrial enlargement.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows calcium deposits
 in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern; however, there is no
 evidence of acute interstitial or alveolar edema.  Also, the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation and no evidence
 of pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  A thin plate atelectasis in the
 left hemithorax mid portion appears to represent the scar as it is completely
 unchanged in comparison with the examination almost one year ago.  Comparison
 with the previous examination demonstrates that the cardiac enlargement
 existed already earlier.  The patient appeared to be slightly more congested
 on the previous examination.  There is no remaining evidence of any right
 upper lobe pneumonia which was diagnosed on a chest examination of ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac enlargement with configuration compatible with systemic
 hypertension, possibly mild congestion but no evidence of advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates.
