                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unremarkable aside from mild unfolding of the descending
 thoracic aorta.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is potentially a very
 small pleural effusion on the right and it is difficult to exclude one on the
 left.  Although an infection is difficult to completely exclude, streaky
 opacities in the lower lungs are more suggestive of scarring than anything
 else by morphology.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal basilar opacities, although more suggestive of
 scarring than pneumonia.  Correlation with radiographs may be helpful if
 available, and if pneumonia is a persistent clinical concern, follow-up
 radiographs could be considered.  Suspected trace pleural effusion on the
 right.  Hyperinflation.
