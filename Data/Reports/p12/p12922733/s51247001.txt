                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level.  The heart
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within
 the limitations of technique.  Streaky medial basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis or scarring, but there are no findings suggestive of pneumonia of
 congestive heart failure.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  No evidence of acute disease.
