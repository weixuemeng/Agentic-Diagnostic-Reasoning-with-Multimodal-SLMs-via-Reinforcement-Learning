                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:55 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right lung is
 unchanged.  The left lung, in its apical parts, is better ventilated than
 previously.  However, the two lower thirds of the left hemithorax are still
 occupied by a combination of effusion and consolidated lung parenchyma.  The
 left border of the heart can still not be delineated.  Known non-recent
 humeral changes.
