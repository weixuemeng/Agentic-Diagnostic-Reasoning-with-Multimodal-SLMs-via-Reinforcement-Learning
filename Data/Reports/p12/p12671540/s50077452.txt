                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:14 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dementia and COPD on oxygen, reintubated. 
 Left mainstem bronchial mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 10:33 a.m.:
 
 Left lung was entirely collapsed on ___, in the extent of re-aeration
 at the left lung apex, though modest has improved since earlier in the day. 
 Lower lobe is still entirely collapsed and there is some volume of left
 pleural fluid.  Vascular congestion has worsened in the right lung.  Heart is
 normal size.  ET tube tip with the chin down is nearly 2 cm from the carina. 
 It could descend further with hyperflexion of the neck, so withdrawal of 10-15
 mm should be considered.  Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the distal
 portion of a non-distended stomach.  Small right pleural effusion is stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
