                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 3 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent aspiration event.  Post-op from left
 diaphragmatic hernia repair. Intubated for bronchoscopy, now extubated.  //
 Check Dobhoff tube placement, evaluate for infiltrates s/p aspiration (pill
 fragments seen in lungs on bronchoscopy).    Check Dobhoff tube placement,
 evaluate for infiltrates s/p aspiration (pill fragments seen in lungs on
 bronchoscopy).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube is
 been removed and replaced with a Dobhoff tube that extends to the upper
 portion of the stomach, with the opaque portion of the tube at or just distal
 to the esophagogastric junction.
 The ETT appears tube been removed.  There is a breathing apparatus in place
 that makes it difficult to assess wet could be a tracheostomy tube.
 Bibasilar opacification is consistent with layering effusions and underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is
 consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure in this patient
 with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
