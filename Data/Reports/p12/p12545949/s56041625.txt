 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left chest tube remains
 in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  With the patient in an
 upright position, there is no definite vascular congestion.  Although the
 atelectatic changes at the bases appear much less prominent on the frontal
 view, there is the basilar opacification posteriorly on the lateral view
 consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectatic changes.
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion at this time.
