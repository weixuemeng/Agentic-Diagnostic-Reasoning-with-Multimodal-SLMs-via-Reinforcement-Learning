                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?RLL opacity and hypoxia seen on portable
 films  // r/o pulmonary process
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest tube noted.  No residual pneumothorax.  NG tube tip lies in the
 stomach.  Pulmonary vessels are within normal limits.  Patchy increased
 density at the lung bases likely represents atelectasis although infection
 cannot be excluded.  The appearance is slightly improved from yesterday's
 examination.
