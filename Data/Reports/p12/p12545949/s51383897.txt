 (___), UGI bleed and multiple SBO's, p/w L diaphragmatic hernia s/p
 diaphragmatic hernia repair, SBR, splenectomy  // ?pneumonia    ?pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again opacification at
 the right base consistent with substantial volume loss in the right lower lung
 and probable pleural fluid.  Increasing opacification at the left base is
 concerning for postsurgical atelectatic changes.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in
 the either lower lung.
