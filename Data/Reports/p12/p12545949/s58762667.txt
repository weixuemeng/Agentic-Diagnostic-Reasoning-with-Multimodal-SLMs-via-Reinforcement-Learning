                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? Pna  // ?pna V's post op atelectasis     
 ?pna V's post op atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm on the right with mild decrease in
 opacification at the left base.  The findings again are consistent with
 pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits, though there is evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be very difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
