                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications at the aortic knob are present.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Remote
 left-sided rib fractures are present.  Partially imaged are posterior fusion
 rods spanning the thoracolumbar spine.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.  Minimal atelectasis in the left lung base.
