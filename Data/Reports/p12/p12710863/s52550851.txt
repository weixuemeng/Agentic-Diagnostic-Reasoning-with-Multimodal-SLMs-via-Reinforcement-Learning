                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, r/o pneumonia  // ___M with cough, r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  A faint nodular opacity overlying the left eighth posterior
 lateral rib is felt to represent a nipple shadow rather than a pulmonary
 nodule.  Comparison to old studies would be helpful.  In their absence,
 followup imaging with nipple markers performed.  In addition, however, there
 is a 0.7 cm nodular opacity at the right apex for which comparison to outside
 radiographs to assess for stability is recommended.  If outside studies are
 not available, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered.  Heart
 size is normal.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.  There is
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  Emphysema.  Right apical 0.7 cm nodular opacity and
 0.9 cm left basilar nodular opacity.  The nodule on the left may represent a
 nipple shadow.  Comparison to remote chest radiographs would be recommended at
 this time.  If these do not become available, further imaging with CT should
 be considered.  .
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were entered into the radiology critical results
 dashboard on ___ at 16:03.
