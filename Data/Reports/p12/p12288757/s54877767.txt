                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate effusion. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dating back to ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours remain widened compared to the
 preoperative radiograph from ___.  Again demonstrated are median
 sternotomy wires and a mitral valve replacement.  The right pleural effusion
 has improved.  However, worsening consolidation at the left lower lobe is
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse with pleural effusion.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left lower lobe collapse.  Stable left effusion, smaller
 right pleural effusion.
