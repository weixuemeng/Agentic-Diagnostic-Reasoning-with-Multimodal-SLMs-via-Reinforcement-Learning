                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart
 size and mediastinum appear to be unchanged including prominence of pulmonary
 artery.  Bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated, potentially slightly
 enlarged, although it may be exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Mild vascular
 congestion is present as well as bibasal atelectasis.  No appreciable
 pneumothorax is seen.
