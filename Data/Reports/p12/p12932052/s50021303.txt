 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, productive cough
 x1 month, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a vague
 linear opacity in the left lower lung which is most compatible with
 atelectasis though the possibility of a very focal pneumonia is impossible to
 exclude.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structure is intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focus of linear opacity in the left lower lung is most compatible
 with atelectasis.
