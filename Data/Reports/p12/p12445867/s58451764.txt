  The patient is slightly rotated.  Nasogastric tube with tip in expected
  location of the stomach.  New small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
  than left.  Right lower lung zone opacitiy is likely compressive atelectasis,
  though a pneumonia or aspiration would be difficult to exclude in the proper
  clinical setting.

 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the gastric tube extends to
 the distal stomach.  Increased opacification at the bases is consistent with
 pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
