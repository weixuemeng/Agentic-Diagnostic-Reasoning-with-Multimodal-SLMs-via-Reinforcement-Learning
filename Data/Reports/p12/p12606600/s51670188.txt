                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mental status changes, low-grade temp, rule out pathology.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 There is probable hyperinflation, suggesting COPD.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with a calcified unfolded
 aorta.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, but
 stable.  Prominence of the pulmonary hila, with a tapered appearance, is also
 stable, and could reflect the presence of an element of hypertension.  As
 before, the right hemidiaphragm is elevated, but unchanged.  Right
 paratracheal soft tissue density likely represents vascular structures in
 someone of this age.  
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and left base is
 similar to the prior study and likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis/scarring.  Crowding of vessels projecting over the lower lobe
 posteriorly on the lateral view is also similar to the prior film, and
 therefore more suggestive of atelectasis/scarring.  No CHF, frank
 consolidation, or effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable background COPD and possible pulmonary hypertension. 
 Possible mild cardiomegaly.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  No new
 infiltrate or superimposed acute pulmonary process detected.
