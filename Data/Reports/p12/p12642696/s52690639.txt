 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  L-spine radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is thought to
 reflect an epicardial fat pad.  This appears unchanged from ___.  A small
 granuloma is again seen in the right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is a tortuous and
 calcified aorta which indents upon the trachea.  There is no displaced rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
