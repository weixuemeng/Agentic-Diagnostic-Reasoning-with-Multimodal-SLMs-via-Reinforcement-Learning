                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis due to perforated viscus, assess line locations transfer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4.5 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A
 left subclavian central line is presen -- the tip does not extend across the
 midline and therefore likely lies in the left brachiocephalic/innominate
 vessel.  It does not reach the SVC.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with lordotic positioning.  There is
 prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, which is probably accentuated
 by this.  Mild vascular plethora is noted, but may also be accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  Patchy opacity at the left base is present. More hazy
 opacity at the right base is suggested.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, without gross right or left effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, not definitely accounted
 for by the low inspiratory volumes and lordotic technique, but likely
 exaggerated by them.
 3.  Possible hazy opacity at the right base.  Attention to this area on
 followup films is recommended to assess for developing pneumonic infiltrate. 
 Patchy opacity at the left base is also present.
