                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p extubation in the AM; cough, crackles  //
 eval for asp pna/pulm edema      eval for asp pna/pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A in comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Continued bibasilar opacifications are
 consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower
 lobe.
 Given the pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
