                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 04:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central venous catheter is again noted terminating at the level of
 the cavoatrial junction.  There has been interval placement of a pigtail left
 chest tube which projects over the lateral aspect of the left mid lung.  Since
 prior exam there is decrease in left pleural effusion with partial
 re-expansion of the left upper lobe.  Airspace opacity in the left upper lobe
 raises potential concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema.  A small left
 apical pneumothorax is noted.  There is mild right basal atelectasis. 
 Otherwise the right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of a left chest tube with decreased left effusion and
 partial re-expansion of the left upper lobe.  However, opacity within the left
 upper lobe is concerning for re-expansion pulmonary edema.
 2. Small left apical pneumothorax.
