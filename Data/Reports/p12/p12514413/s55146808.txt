                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest. There is a moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion, increased from prior study.  There is also likely a small left
 pleural effusion.  There are bilateral patchy opacities, consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  More focal opacity in the right lower lobe may represent
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  Left-sided pacemaker is seen in appropriate
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on right and mild on
 left, and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  A more consolidative right lower
 lobe opacity may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
