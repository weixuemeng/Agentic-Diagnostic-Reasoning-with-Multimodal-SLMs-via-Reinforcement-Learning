 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with suspected aspiration.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis have increased in the
 interim.  It might potentially reflect underlying aspiration, but infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in
 appearance as well as the pacemaker lead placement.  There is no pneumothorax.
