 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoglycemia and altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate mild cardiomegaly and
 a pacemaker with leads in the right ventricle and right atrium.  New hazy
 right lower lobe opacity is likely a combination of effusion and atelectasis. 
 There is also a small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity most
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  No focal
 consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.  No free air.  No displaced rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
