                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-op fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Substantial consolidation of the right lower and right middle lobe
 is likely atelectatic in the post-operative setting; however, infection cannot
 be excluded.  A component of pleural effusion may possibly add to this right
 lower lung consolidation.  The right lung apex and left lung are clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The right heart border is partially obscured by the
 adjacent consolidation; however, the heart size is likely normal with normal
 mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe consolidation with a
 possible component of pleural effusion, which is likely atelectatic in the
 post-operative setting; however, infection cannot be excluded given the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.
