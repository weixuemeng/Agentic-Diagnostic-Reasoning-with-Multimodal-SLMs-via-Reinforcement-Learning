                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall downstairs, now with fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the ET tube and gastric tube. 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is a small asymmetry at the right lung
 base which raises the possibility of pneumonia, but cannot be confirmed on the
 lateral view.  There are no other focal opacities.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is calcific tendinosis of the
 right rotator cuff.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small asymmetry in the right lung base raises suspicion for pneumonia but
 cannot be confirmed on lateral view.  
 
 2.  Incidental note of calcific tendinosis of right rotator cuff.
