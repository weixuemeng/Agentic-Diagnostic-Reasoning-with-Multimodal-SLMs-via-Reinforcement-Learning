                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG and aortic valve
 replacement, two days after surgery.
 
 AP chest radiograph was reviewed.
 
 The patient was extubated with removal of the supporting devices.  Mediastinal
 and cardiac contours are unchanged, but enlarged.  Bilateral pleural effusion
 is most likely present and small.  Minimal vascular congestion is noted, but
 no overt edema is seen.
