                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, postop day 4, status post CABG and AVR. 
 Evaluate effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Median sternotomy wires, aortic valve replacement, mediastinal surgical clips
 are again noted, no change in alignment.  There is persistent opacity at the
 left lung base, though aeration is improved from two days prior.  Persistent
 linear opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Left pleural effusion is
 small.  Trace right pleural fluid is also present.  Lungs are otherwise well
 aerated.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration at the left lung base, with persistent linear
 atelectasis and small amount of pleural fluid.
