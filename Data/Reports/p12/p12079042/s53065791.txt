                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with back pain  // eval for ptx, rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  NO DISPLACED RIB FRACTURE IS IDENTIFIED.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process seen. No displaced rib
 fracture identified, however, if there is high concern for such, suggest
 dedicated rib series or chest CT, which are more sensitive.
