                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung volumes are low. 
 There is no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis is present. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 no effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  A rib series with a marker placed at site
 of pain is more sensitive for subtle rib injury.
