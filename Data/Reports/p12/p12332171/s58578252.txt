                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient positioning. Mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy opacity in the
 retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis. Infection is not excluded. A
 small left pleural effusion is likely present. The right lung is grossly
 clear. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to patient positioning. Patchy retrocardiac opacity,
 potentially atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. Trace left pleural
 effusion may be present.
