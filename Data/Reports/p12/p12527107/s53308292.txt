 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o papillary thyroid cancer and cardiogenic

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral diffuse centrally-distributed opacities which likely reflect
 cardiogenic edema are mildly improved compared to the most recent studies. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is seen and unchanged from previous studies.  The right
 PICC line is unchanged in position with tip terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are seen.  Single lead
 transvenous pacemaker is seen with the lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly improved bilateral diffuse centrally-distributed opacities which likely
 reflect cardiogenic edema.
