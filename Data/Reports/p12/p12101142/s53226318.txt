 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams  // ro infection

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No large pleural
 effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Perihilar opacities
 may be exaggerated by low lung volumes although mild vascular engorgement is
 not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Old right clavicular
 fracture is redemonstrated.
