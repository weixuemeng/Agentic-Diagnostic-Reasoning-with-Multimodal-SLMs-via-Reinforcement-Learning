                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post attempted internal jugular
 approach for placement of central venous line.  Assess for pneumo or acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the upper chest was obtained.  Available for
 comparison is the next preceding portable chest examination of ___ with
 patient in supine position.  On the present examination, the patient is
 extubated.  Multiple lines apparently external, are overlying the upper chest.
 Status post sternotomy and previous bypass surgery appears unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax
 on either side in the apical areas nor is there evidence of any widening of
 the superior mediastinum and the aortic arch contour is unchanged in
 comparison with the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considering that the patient has been partially elevated, this
 study eliminates the possibility of a pneumothorax on either side.
