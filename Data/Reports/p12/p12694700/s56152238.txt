                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Critical AS, status post upper GI bleed, now hypotensive and
 tachycardic, evidence of infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable with
 moderate cardiomegaly.  There may be a small left pleural effusion with a new
 small left basilar opacity.  There is no pneumothorax or right pleural
 effusion.  There is no new focal consolidation; however, left basilar
 pneumonia is possible in the correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, new since the prior study, with possible
 small left pleural effusion which may be indicative of infection in the
 correct clinical setting.
