                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AFib with pacemaker with rapid ventricular response.   
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are mild bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis.  The upper
 lung fields are clear.  A more focal 9 x 4-mm nodule is noted overlying the
 left lower lobe. There is likely moderate cardiomegaly.  A 2 lead pacemaker is
 noted.  There is mild cephalization of vascular sheath suggesting minimal
 increased central venous pressures.  No acute fractures are identified.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are
 noted at the bilateral glenohumeral joints.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild bibasilar opacities suggesting atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process otherwise identified.  
 2. 9 x 4-mm nodule is noted overlying the left lower lobe. Further
 characterization with a dedicated CT is recommended. 
 3. Moderate cardiomegaly.
