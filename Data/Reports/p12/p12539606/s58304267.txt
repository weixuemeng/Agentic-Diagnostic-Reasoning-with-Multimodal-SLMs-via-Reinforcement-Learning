                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia 170s, chest pain, trouble breathing  // ?
 PTX, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lung volumes are somewhat low. There is a
 vague indistinctness to the right heart border which could represent a subtle
 consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Vague indistinctness to the right heart border could
 represent an area of atelectasis or infection.  Consider repeat imaging with
 better inspiration as this finding does not seem to correlate with the
 clinical history.
