                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with bullet fragments and a clip
 again demonstrated within the lower thoracic spine.  Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Minimal left basilar streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is otherwise
 demonstrated. Remote left-sided rib fractures are noted, but no acutely
 displaced fracture is identified. Clips are again seen in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or acute
 displaced fracture identified. If there is continued concern for a rib
 fracture, consider a dedicated rib series.
