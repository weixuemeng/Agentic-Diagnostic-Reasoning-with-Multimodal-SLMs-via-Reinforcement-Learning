                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-IJ line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ at 12:43 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Due to difficulty in patient positioning, only a
 supine portable radiograph was obtained.  Multiple intact sternal wires and
 mediastinal clips denote prior cardiac surgery.  There has been interval
 placement of a right IJ catheter terminating at the low SVC.  The lung volumes
 are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  No pneumothorax is detected,
 although the right costophrenic angle is excluded on this study and the
 patient is supine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right IJ catheter terminating at the low SVC.
 2.  No pneumothorax detected; however, the technique was suboptimal for such
 evaluation.  A repeat study can be considered if there remains a high clinical
 concern for pneumothorax.
