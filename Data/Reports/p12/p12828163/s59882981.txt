                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diarrhea for 3 days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  A large hiatal hernia is again
 demonstrated.  An aortic valve graft prosthesis is again seen.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The lungs are hyperinflated. 
 No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 appears worse compared to the prior exam, and could either reflect atelectasis
 adjacent to the hiatal hernia or aspiration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly evident.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis or aspiration given the
 presence of a large hiatal hernia.
