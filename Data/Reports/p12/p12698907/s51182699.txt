 evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are diffuse bilateral ground-glass

 is top normal but unchanged from prior.  The mediastinal silhouette is normal,
 however, there is thickening of the right paratracheal stripe.

 etiology.  Enlargement of the paratracheal stripe is likely reactive, however,
 follow up to ensure resolution is recommended once symptomatology has
 resolved.
