                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Spiking fevers, atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The appearance of the lung parenchyma is unchanged.  A zone of
 slightly increased radiodensity is seen in the right upper lobe and likely to
 be caused by patient position.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
