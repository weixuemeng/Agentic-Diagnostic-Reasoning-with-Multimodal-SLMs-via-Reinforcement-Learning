                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nasal intubation for next soft tissue
 mass.  Check position of endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:52.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 4:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet,
 approximately 5 cm above carina.  Lungs remain well inflated.  Minimal patchy
 opacity at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis, although an early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
