                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 New transvenous right atrial lead projects low over the right atrium, and the
 right ventricular lead along the floor of the right ventricle to the apex.  No
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion or attributable mediastinal widening.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is slightly worse today than it was in ___.  Thoracic aorta
 is generally large and tortuous but not obviously aneurysmal.  Pulmonary
 vascular engorgement suggests that the mild interstitial abnormality is
 probably a component of edema, but it is minimal.  There is no pleural
 effusion.
