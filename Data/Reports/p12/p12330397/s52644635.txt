                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, infectious workup.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 There is minimal opacity at both lung bases, likely representing some
 subsegmental atelectasis, similar, but slightly more pronounced, than on the
 ___ radiograph.  At the left, the opacity is more extensive and the
 differential diagnosis could include an early infectious infiltrate or site of
 aspiration.  No frank consolidation is detected.  Extreme left costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the film.  No gross effusion is identified.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Splaying of the carina is
 consistent with left atrial enlargement.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change in the appearance
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  
 
 Slight prominence of the right hilum, with a tapered appearance, could reflect
 an element of pulmonary hypertension. The lungs are probably hyperinflated,
 suggesting COPD.  
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate.  No CHF.  
 
 Again noted is a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker with lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal opacity at the left base, slightly more pronounced than in ___. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change detected. 
 
 While this likely represents atelectasis, the differential diagnosis could
 include an early infectious infiltrate or site of aspiration.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right base.  Otherwise, I doubt acute pulmonary process.
