                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea consistent with CHF exacerbation, possible
 underlying pneumonia, evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 15:10.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads in
 grossly appropriate location.  There is a tortuous and calcified thoracic
 aorta.  Marked cardiac enlargement is stable.  In comparison to prior
 radiograph, there is an improved inspiratory effort.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings is consistent with persistent pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The right lower lung is now
 clear.  There is no focal lung consolidation elsewhere.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. No focal lung consolidation.
