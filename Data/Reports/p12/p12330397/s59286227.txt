                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary interstitial edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions suggestive of congestive heart failure changes is
 unchanged since ___. Concurrently associated pneumonia, however,
 cannot be ruled out, required attention on followup radiographs.  Increased
 retrocardiac density reflects left lower lung atelectasis.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours have been stable.
 
 Aorta is generally tortuous but without evidence of aneurysmal widening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Congestive heart failure changes and bilateral lower lung
 atelectasis unchanged since ___. Any element of concurrent
 pneumonia cannot be ruled out, should be followed up on the radiographs.
