                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea, chest tightness.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia, effusion or secondary signs of pulmonary embolism.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could represent atelectasis, and no
 corresponding blunting is appreciated on the lateral view.  Linear markings in
 the left lung base are again noted, likely representing scarring or
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle could represent atelectasis as no corresponding effusion is appreciated
 on the lateral view.
