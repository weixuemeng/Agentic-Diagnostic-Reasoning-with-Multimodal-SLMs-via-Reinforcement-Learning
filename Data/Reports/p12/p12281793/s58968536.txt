                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is opacification of the lower right lung zone, with a lucent
 crescent just superior to the opacified portion.  Pleural effusion tracks
 behind the aerated upper lobe.  There is soft tissue thickening along the
 right main bronchus.  An opacity projects over the left mid lung zone.  The
 mediastinal structures are roughly midline, without apparent volume loss. 
 There is no left pleural effusion.  Indentations upon the right lateral aspect
 of the trachea are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lung zone white out, which might be the result of airway
 obstruction with post-obstructive pneumonia, collapse (though lack of volume
 loss argues against this), or paralysis of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
 a superimposed right pleural effusion/pleural thickening.  Additional findings
 of a mass in the left mid lung zone and probable lymphadenopathy in a
 paratracheal distribution all argue in favor of a metastatic process.  CT is
 recommended for further evaluation.
 2.  The lucent crescent seen adjacent to the lower portion of the aerated left
 lung is felt unlikely to be free air, though this can be better evaluated with
 CT.
