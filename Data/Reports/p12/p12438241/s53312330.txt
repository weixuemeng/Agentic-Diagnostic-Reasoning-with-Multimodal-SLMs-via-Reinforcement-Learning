                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial.  The lung volumes are relatively low, that might
 explain crowding of the vessels in the lower lungs.  No definitive evidence of
 pneumonia is demonstrated.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
