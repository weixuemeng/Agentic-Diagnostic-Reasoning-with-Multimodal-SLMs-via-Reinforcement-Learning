   No evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild increase in opacificaiton around the known
  left upper lung zone mass, possibly due to minimal post-biopsy hemorrhage or
  some residual edema after bronchoscopy.  Attention on follow-up exams is
  recommended.  Otherwise unchanged emphysema and small left effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper lobe biopsy, query pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  Linear density
 projecting over the left apex may be concerning for pneumothorax, but was
 clearly present on the prior study in ___.  There are expected
 post-biopsy changes including increased interstitial markings in the left lung
 field, which may be due to residual edema.  Left upper lobe opacity remains,
 slightly denser and larger with more ill-defined borders than prior, which may
 be due to minimal hemorrhage post-biopsy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax with expected post-biopsy changes.
