                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with hematoma on the left head.  Question acute
 disease or trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs are available from ___ as well as
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead/ICD pacemaker with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, respectively, appears similar to ___. 
 Allowing for low lung volumes and AP upright technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours also appear unchanged including a stable convex
 contour to the right upper mediastinum.  There is a mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality suggestive of mild fluid overload but without focal opacification.
 There is no evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  Degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload.  No definite evidence of
 injury.
