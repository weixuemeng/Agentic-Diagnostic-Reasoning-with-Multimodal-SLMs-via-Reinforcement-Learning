                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An approximately 6 mm diameter rounded opacity is again
 demonstrated in the left retrocardiac region, to the left of the descending
 aortic interface.  It overlies the tenth left posterior rib level and is not
 definitively calcified but overlap with rib limits this assessment.  Lungs are
 otherwise notable for surgical chain sutures in right mid lung. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Left subclavian and
 brachiocephalic vascular stents remain in place.  Minimal pleural thickening
 versus small effusion at lateral right costophrenic sulcus.  No acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 6 mm diameter left lower lobe opacity is unchanged since recent chest
 radiograph, but is not fully characterized.  Considering patient's
 immunosuppressed status and concern for acute infection, CT may be considered
 for more complete evaluation of this region if warranted clinically.  This was
 discussed by telephone with the physician covering for Dr. ___ at pager ___
 on ___ at 11:50 a.m.
