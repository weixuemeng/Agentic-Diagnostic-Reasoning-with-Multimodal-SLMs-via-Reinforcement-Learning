                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right chest pain, nausea for 2 days.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are bilateral pleural
 effusions, new from prior exam with subjacent consolidation which could
 represent compressive atelectasis.  The possibility of pneumonia is not
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in size.  A
 vascular stent is again noted in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  No free air is seen below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent consolidation new from prior exam
 raises concern for fluid overload.  Correlate with renal function.
