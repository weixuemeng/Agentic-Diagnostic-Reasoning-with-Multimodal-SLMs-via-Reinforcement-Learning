                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no additional line or
 monitoring devices visible on the current examination.  The pre-existing
 Swan-Ganz catheter is in unchanged position.  As on the previous report, it is
 noted that the the device needs to be pulled back by approximately 4 cm, as it
 is located too far in the right pulmonary system.  Unchanged evidence of
 vascular stents and the right pleural effusion distributes in a different
 manner, but is overall unchanged in extent.  The left lung appears unchanged.
