 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent myocardial infarction, status post thoracocentesis, rule
 out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  The extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion has
 substantially decreased.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The signs
 indicative of mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema are also improved,
 but the heart continues to be large and the contours of the left hilus
 continue to be bulging outwards.  Atelectasis at the left and right lung bases
 are unchanged.  No evidence of pneumonia.
