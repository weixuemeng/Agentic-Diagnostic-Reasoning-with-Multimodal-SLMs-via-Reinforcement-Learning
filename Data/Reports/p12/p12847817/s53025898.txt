                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  A moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion is
 slightly increased in volume compared to prior examination with collapse of
 much of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.  There is also some
 consolidation at the base of the right upper lobe which could be due to
 compressive atelectasis.  There is no left effusion.  The upper lung zones
 appear clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly increased moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with
 collapse of much of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  Superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance.
