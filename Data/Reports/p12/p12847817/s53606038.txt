                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion and congestive heart failure.  Question loculation
 of right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA, lateral and right lateral decubitus.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC line passes through a left brachiocephalic stent
 and terminates at the distal superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  A moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right
 freely layers.  There is also a small left-sided layering pleural effusion. 
 Substantial coinciding right basilar atelectasis seems to involve collapse of
 all or much of the right middle lobe and substantial elements of the right
 lower lobe.  There is no shift of mediastinal structures.
