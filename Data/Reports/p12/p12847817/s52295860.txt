 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal radiographs of the chest demonstrate unchanged cardiomegaly.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate
 pulmonary edema increased from the prior.  Bibasilar and retrocardiac
 opacities likely representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
 with moderate to large pleural effusion on the right increased in size;
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Left vascular stent is
 unchanged.
