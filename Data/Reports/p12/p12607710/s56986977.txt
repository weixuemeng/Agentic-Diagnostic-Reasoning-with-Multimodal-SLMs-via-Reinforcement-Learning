                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Of the two
 frontal views provided, only one is with deep inspiration.  The heart is of
 normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Linear opacity overlying
 the right upper lung is compatible with scarring or atelectasis.  Interstitial
 markings on the lateral radiograph are likely due to low lung volumes.  No
 clear pulmonary consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with right upper lung scarring or atelectasis. 
 No lobar consolidation or pleural effusion.
