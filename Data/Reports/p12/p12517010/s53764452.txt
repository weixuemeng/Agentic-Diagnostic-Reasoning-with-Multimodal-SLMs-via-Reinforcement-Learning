 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Although this
 could merely represent atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia should be considered.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
