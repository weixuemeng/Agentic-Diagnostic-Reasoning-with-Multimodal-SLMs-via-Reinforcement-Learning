                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation and frequent premature beats.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  A left-sided pleural effusion has largely resolved.  A right-sided
 pleural effusion appears to contain a less conspicuous right lateral loculated
 component but probably remains small to moderate in size with associated
 atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent mild to moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  Decrease in
 left-sided pleural effusion, not optimally visualized but probably fairly
 small.
