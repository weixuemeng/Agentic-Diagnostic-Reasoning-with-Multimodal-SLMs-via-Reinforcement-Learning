                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Some indistinctness of
 engorged pulmonary vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
