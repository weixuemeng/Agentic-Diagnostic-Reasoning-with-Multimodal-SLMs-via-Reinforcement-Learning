                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, generalized weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 at the aortic arch.  There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Additionally moderate size layering bilateral pleural effusions are relatively
 similar compared to the prior examination.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 compressive atelectasis.  Marked degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral
 and acromioclavicular joint are noted along with multilevel degenerative
 changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Layering moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
