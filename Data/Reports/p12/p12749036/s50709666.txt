 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diastolic chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of relatively substantial bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of
 atelectasis.  Other than on the previous radiograph, however, there is no
 evidence of interstitial lung edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  In the well
 ventilated lung parenchyma, there is no pneumonia.
