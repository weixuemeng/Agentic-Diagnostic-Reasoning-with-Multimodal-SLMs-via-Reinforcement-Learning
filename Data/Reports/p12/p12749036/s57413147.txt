                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD and CHF p/w with edema and weight gain 
 // please evaluate for volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural
 effusion has mildly increased.  The extent of the effusions, both on the left
 than on the right, are better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal
 view.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mild fluid overload but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The areas of atelectasis at the lung bases are proportional
 to the extent of the pleural effusions.
