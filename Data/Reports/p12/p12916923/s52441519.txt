                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bibasilar patchy opacities which are nonspecific and may
 represent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart
 size is top normal.  Pulmonary vascular cephalization suggests borderline
 congestive heart failure. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Borderline congestive heart failure. 
 2. Non-specific bibasilar subtle opacities, chronicity indeterminate in the
 absence of prior imaging.
