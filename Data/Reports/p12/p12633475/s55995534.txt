 INDICATION:  History of asthma with cough for three days.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  There is mild bronchial wall
 thickening.  There is no focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  The
 heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bronchial wall thickening may reflect bronchitis.  There is
 no evidence of pneumonia.
