 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is a right IJ
 central venous catheter terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction. 
 The heart size appears increased from prior which could in part reflect
 technique though clinical correlation is advised.  There is poorly defined
 ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe which appears slightly different
 from the prior right mid lung opacity though remains concerning for pneumonia.
 There is a E right pleural effusion which is seen layering posteriorly.  The
 left lung appears clear.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and pulmonary
 vascular congestion is suspected.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly is new from prior and clinical correlation is advised.
 2.  Persistent right lower lung opacity though slightly different in
 appearance from prior remains concerning for pneumonia.  Small right pleural
