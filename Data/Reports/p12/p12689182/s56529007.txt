                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // f/u effusions, atx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, which may be slightly improved, but some of the
 apparent differences are likely accentuated by technical factors.
 
 There is platelike atelectasis in both mid zones.  No frank consolidation. 
 Small bilateral effusions noted.
 
 No overt CHF.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change.
