                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is patchy calcification along
 the aortic arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Patchy opacities with a nodular configuration at each lung
 apex suggesting chronic scarring including at least one possible right apical
 lung of perhaps 12 mm.  Nipple shadows are also visualized bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Hyperinflation.  Nodular opacities
 at each lung apex including a possible discrete nodule at the medial right
 lung apex.  
 
 Evaluation with chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate as a
 baseline for follow-up.  Correlation with prior radiographs, if available, is
 recommended to assess for stability of this appearance.
