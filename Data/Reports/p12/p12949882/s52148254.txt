                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of IDDM, HTN, HLD, prior hemorrhagic stroke with only
 L-sided visual field deficits who presents due to altered mental status,
 please re-assess RML PNA as noted on prior CXR.  // ?RML PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 03:59
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pre-existing areas of atelectasis
 and crowding at the lung bases have almost completely resolved. There is
 currently no evidence for the presence of a pathologic parenchymal change. 
 The heart continues to be borderline in size, with diameters of the pulmonary
 arteries at the upper range of normal. Mild elongation of the descending
 aorta.  No pulmonary edema.  No larger pleural effusions.
