                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular
 prominence persists.  No definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 There is a suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base,
 though this was also seen on the previous study.  In the appropriate clinical
 situation, an early consolidation could be considered.
