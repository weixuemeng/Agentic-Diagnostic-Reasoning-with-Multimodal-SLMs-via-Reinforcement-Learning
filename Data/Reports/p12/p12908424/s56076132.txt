                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  A left-sided AICD device
 is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly appears increased in size compared to the prior study.  The aorta
 remains tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the aortic arch.
 Mild pulmonary edema is present along with trace bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lungs
 remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD.  Mild degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged within the upper abdomen is
 an aortic stent graft.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
