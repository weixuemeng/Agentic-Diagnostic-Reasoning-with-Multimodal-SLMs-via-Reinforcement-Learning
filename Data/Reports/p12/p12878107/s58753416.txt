                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough productive, phlegm shortness of breath, treatment
 one week ago with antibiotics, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear; however, there is increased convexity at the right
 cardiophrenic angle since ___.  This could only be an increasing cardiac fat
 pad; however, an underlying lesion cannot be excluded.  For this reason, a CT
 scan is suggested.  The remaining of the exam is normal.  
 
 The results were posted to the radiology dashboard for direct notification of
 the referring physician.
