                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with small lung laceration, asymptomatic.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 evident on this view.  The small lung laceration seen on CT is not evident
 radiographically.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Mild thoracic scoliosis and loss of lower thoracic vertebral body height is
 consistent with known fracture, better seen on CT.  Prior left clavicular
 fracture is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary findings.
