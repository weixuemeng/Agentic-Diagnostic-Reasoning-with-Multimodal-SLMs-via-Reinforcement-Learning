                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ongoing tachypnea s/p diuresis and known
 sarcoid, RUL mass  // assess interval resolution of edema, RUL mass
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.  as
 well as several intervening chest CT scans.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Today the background density of the left lung is less abnormal, which may
 account for better definition of the left hilus that also looks smaller. 
 Right hilus is still severely enlarged.  There is still very severe
 infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, as well as stigmata of chronic fibrosing
 interstitial lung disease including traction bronchiectasis in the right upper
 lobe.
 
 New today are small bilateral pleural effusions, left-greater-than-right
 common visible on the lateral film as well.  Periodic variations in the
 severity of lung finding suggests repeat exposures.  There may at sometimes be
 a component of cardiac decompensation and pulmonary edema, but I think most of
 the abnormality is pulmonary in origin.
