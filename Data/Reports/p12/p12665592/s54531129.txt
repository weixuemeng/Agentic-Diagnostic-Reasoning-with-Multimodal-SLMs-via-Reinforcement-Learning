                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sarcoid with one week of fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse interstitial abnormality, slightly more prominent
 at the bilateral bases, and of uncertain chronicity.  The bilateral hila are
 enlarged.  There is no dense consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality of uncertain chronicity, which could be
 due to sarcoid, although atypical infection cannot be excluded.  Recommend
 correlation with prior chest radiographs if available.
 2.  Enlarged hila, likely from lymphadenopathy related to sarcoid.  Consider
 correlation with prior imaging or a nonurgent CT of the chest for further
 evaluation.
