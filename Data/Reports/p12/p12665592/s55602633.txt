                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe DOE in the setting of heart failure
 and severe COPD, now with worsening hypoxemia  // Evaluate for worsening
 pulmonary edema     Evaluate for worsening pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with a study ___, there is again prominence of both
 hilar regions with a dense band of atelectasis in the left mid zone. 
 Interstitial prominence is again seen at the right base consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  At the left base, there is increasing prominence
 of opacification consistent with pleural effusion and underlying volume loss. 
 This makes it difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
 There may be some mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
