                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with copd and chf, now sob pls eval  // History: ___F
 with copd and chf, now sob pls eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, and ___. Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial abnormalities and multifocal airspace opacities are
 longstanding and variable in severity, accompanied by chronic bilateral hilar
 enlargement. Findings are minimally improved as compared to the prior
 examination dated ___, and are compatible with known interstitial
 lung disease.  There may be new consolidation in the left lower lobe, and
 growth of an irregularly shaped 2cm focal lesion in the right upper lobe. 
 There is no pleural effusion and probably no pulmonary edema. Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable from the prior exam. The descending aorta is partially
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Slight interval improvement in the patient's baseline interstitial lung
 disease.  Longterm variability suggest an element of exposure, such as acute
 and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia.
 
 3.  No evidence of acute congestive heart failure.
 
 4.  Possible right upper lobe mass or focal infection.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___  by telephone
 ___ ___ at 10:10 AM,  minutes after discovery of the findings.
