                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia or acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest without contrast
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes bilaterally. Mildly enlarged heart with
 interstitial and alveolar prominence, mild azygos vein prominence,
 peribronchial cuffing, and Kerley B lines is consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. Bilateral hilar prominance may be from
 pulmonary edema. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable.  Visualized
 pleural surfaces are normal. No pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Recommend post diuresis films to exclude underlying pathology given hilar
 prominance.
