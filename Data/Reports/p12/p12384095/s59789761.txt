                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and earlier CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is again moderately
 tortuous with patchy calcification.  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests
 minor atelectasis or scarring in the left lower lobe.  There is a small
 suspected left-sided pleural effusion.  There are mildly displaced fractures
 involving the anterior left second through fifth ribs.  There is displacement
 among left anterior second, third, and fifth fractures by nearly a half shaft
 width.  These show vague sclerosis, particularly the fifth, suggesting callus,
 but without complete remodeling.  
  
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple rib fractures, including three mildly displaced
 fractures with suspected early callus formation.  Small left-sided pleural
 effusion.
