                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild right basilar
 linear atelectasis without pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are normal allowing for
 low lung volumes.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to the
 prior study.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right basilar atelectasis.  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
