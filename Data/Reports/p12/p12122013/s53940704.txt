                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which likely reflects the presence of
 scarring as seen along the periphery of the left mid and lower lung.  Aside
 from this, the lungs appear clear and there are no signs of pneumonia, CHF,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Overall heart size appears within normal
 limits.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures appear intact.    There are clips in the right
 upper quadrant noted from prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of scarring in the left mid and lower lung periphery with
 slight elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
