                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear.  Moderate-to-severe rightward convex curvature is
 centered along the mid thoracic spine including left-sided wedging among
 several mid thoracic vertebral bodies, although not fully characterized.  This
 appearance is unlikely to reflect recent trauma, however, and may be secondary
 to long-standing scoliosis or congenital vertebral body anomalies.  There is
 no evidence for recent fracture, dislocation, or bone destruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe scoliosis.  No evidence for recent injury or
 acute cardiopulmonary disease.
