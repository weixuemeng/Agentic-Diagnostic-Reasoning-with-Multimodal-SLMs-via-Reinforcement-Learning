                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with critical AS, RCA dissection, hypotension
 and chest pain with HD increasing O2 requirement  // worsening pulm edema,
 effusion?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 14:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.
 
 Cardiomegaly is again seen, similar to prior.
 
 As before, there is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Suspect small left effusion.  There is
 also hazy opacity at the right base, an blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle, consistent with atelectasis and small effusion.  There is vascular
 plethora, slightly more than on the prior exam.
 
 Note made again made of a dual-lumen right-sided catheter with lead tips over
 the right atrium an ___ dilute and a left-sided dual lead pacemaker, similar in
 configuration.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Prominent rounded lucency overlying left cardiac silhouette is probably
 unchanged.  No air was seen within the pericardium on the CT from ___.
 This likely represents air within the lung, adjacent to the heart.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased vascular engorgement compared with ___.
 
 Continuing cardiomegaly, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, right
 base atelectasis.  The right effusion is slightly larger.
 
 Targeted review of interval CT from ___ showed a small pericardial
