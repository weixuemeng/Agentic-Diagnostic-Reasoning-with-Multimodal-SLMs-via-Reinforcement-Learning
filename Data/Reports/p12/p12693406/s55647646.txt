                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough x4 days 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Given slightly low lung volumes, the lungs appear clear.  Cardiac size is
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The lateral view is limited due to overlying soft tissues and
 the low lung volumes.
 
 L-shaped metallic density along with 2 other small densities, one projecting
 right of the trachea the other near the left shoulder are presumed to be
 external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. L-shaped metallic density (question external jugular line?) along with 2
 other small densities, one projecting right of the trachea the other near the
 left shoulder are presumed to be external to the patient.  Correlate
 clinically.
