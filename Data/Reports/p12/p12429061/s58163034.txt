 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:28 PM
  Emphysema with calcified tortuous aorta. Rightward deviation of the trachea,
  as seen previously, likely secondary to enlarged left lobe of the thyroid,
  which has not been evaluated by US since ___ per our records. If clinically
  indicated, further evaluation could be performed with ultrasound to assess for
  interval change.  Clinical concern for abdominal aortic aneurysm, now
  symptomatic, was expressed. CTA abdomen and pelvis was recommended. Discussed
  with Dr. ___ by phone at 8:25 p.m. on ___ at the time of wet

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are somewhat hyperexpanded and suggestive of chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Mild
 left basilar atelectasis is noted, but the lungs are without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Again noted is marked rightward
 deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet, similar to prior study and
 most likely representative of an underlying goiter.  There is aortic
 tortuosity with calcifications of the aortic arch.  Diffuse osteopenia is
 again noted.   A clip is noted in right upper quadrant and consistent with
 history of cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmomary process.
