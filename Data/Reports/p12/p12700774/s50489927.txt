 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate new elevation

 otherwise clear and heart size is normal.  There is a left upper lobe
 paraaortic mass which is stable in size.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New elevation of the left hemidiaphragm raises concern for phrenic nerve
 palsy. Fluoroscopic or ultrasound evaluation recommended.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
