 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:04 AM
  Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation. Bilateral pleural effusions likely
  present. Bibasilar atelectasis; underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
  Mild pulmonary vascular prominence, which may be exaggerated by low lung
  volumes. Few demonstrated areas of peribronchial cuffing could be seen in the
  setting of fluid overload, but not well assessed on this study. Discussed with
  ___ by phone at 5 a.m. on ___ at the time of initial review
  of the study in response to wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by
 the low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchial vasculature and
 bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side.  Engorgement of the vessels
 could be due to projection and low lung volumes but fluid overload can also be
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The stomach is distended.
