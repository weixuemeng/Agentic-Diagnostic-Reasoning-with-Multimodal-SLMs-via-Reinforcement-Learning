                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, COPD, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited as the left lung base is excluded from the field of view. 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Smooth left superior mediastinal fullness
 may reflect mediastinal lipomatosis.  The aortic knob is well defined.  The
 hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No
 large focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified given the limitations of this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited assessment of the left lung base.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
