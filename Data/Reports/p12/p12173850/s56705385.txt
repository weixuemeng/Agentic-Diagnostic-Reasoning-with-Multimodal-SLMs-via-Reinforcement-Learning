                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with epigastric pain and known hiatal hernia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT abdomen and
 pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded. Previously demonstrated
 small hiatal hernia on CT is not seen on this single frontal view.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Degenerative changes
 are noted involving the thoracic spine and both acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Previously demonstrated small hiatal hernia seen
 on CT is not visualized on the current exam.
