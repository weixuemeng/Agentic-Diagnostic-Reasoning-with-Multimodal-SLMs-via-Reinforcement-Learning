 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with multiple myeloma, worked up for autotransplant.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  An ill-defined opacity in
 the right upper lobe projecting over the sixth posterior right rib is denser
 than before, could be located in the lung or in the ribs.  CT is recommended
 for further evaluation.  Right lower lobe opacity is unchanged and is likely
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  For osseous findings, please refer to
 concurrent skeletal survey.  Multiple surgical clips are in the left axilla.
