                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post dual-chamber permanent
 pacer implantation.  Evaluate lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest
 examination of ___.  On the present examination, one can identify
 a newly placed permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position, seen to be
 connected with two intracavitary electrodes terminating in a position
 compatible with mid anterior portion of the right atrial wall and the second
 terminating in the apical portion of the right ventricle.Thus the position is
 good provided that good contact has been established.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged with a configuration favoring the left ventricle.  The
 thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated but no local contour
 abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and no
 acute pulmonary infiltrates are seen.  An unclear finding consists of a double
 large size metallic ring structure overlying the heart shadow on the frontal
 view.  On the lateral view, a metallic singe ring projects in the ___
 the heart shadow and another square metallic structure is located posteriorly
 to it.  It is concluded that all these metallic structures are not belonging
 to the pacemaker device, but most consistent of external devices that have
 been moved between the taking of the frontal and lateral views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged heart size.  Pacer with dual electrodes in appropriate
 position.  No pneumothorax.Ref. cardiologist was reached by telephone at time
 of dictation.
