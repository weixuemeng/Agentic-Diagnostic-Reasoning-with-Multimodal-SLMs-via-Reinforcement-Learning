                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  A linear opacity at
 the right base is most likely atelectasis.  There is no focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
