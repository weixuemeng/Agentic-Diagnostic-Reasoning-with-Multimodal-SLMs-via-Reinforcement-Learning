                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF exacerbation, possible NSTEMI, concern
 for retrocardiac opacity at outside hospital.  // evaluate for pulmonary
 edema, any evidence of consolidation?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a left retrocardiac opacity has newly
 appeared.  The opacity is better visualized on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph.  The change is located at the level of the dorsal costophrenic
 sinus, is ill-defined and shows air bronchograms.  Pneumonia would be the most
 likely differential diagnosis.  However, correlation with previous radiographs
 as well as the clinical presentation is required to make this determination.
 Low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 structures.  No pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  If the patient does not clinically present present with a
 picture suggestive of pneumonia, CT should be performed to rule out the
 presence of a left lower lobe neoplasm.
