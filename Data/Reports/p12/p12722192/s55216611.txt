                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with myeloma and 3 days of coughing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates well-expanded lungs with no
 clear focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Within the left lower lobe
 but there is linear opacification, most likely atelectasis and which may
 represent proximal bronchial narrowing.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  No definite large pleural effusion is
 identified.  Note is made of a lower thoracic compression fracture, new since
 ___, as well as left posterior rib expansion consistent with known history of
 myeloma.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Linear opacity within left
 lingula suggests the possibility of proximal bronchial narrowing and severe
 bronchitis.  Additional oblique views are recommended for further localization
 and characterization, though diagnosis is unlikely to be changed.
 
 Lower thoracic lumbar compression fracture, new since ___, and expansion of
 left ribs consistent with known diagnosis of myeloma.
 
 These findings and recommendations were discussed with ordering physician ___.
 ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 12:25 on ___ immediately
 upon review of the radiographs.
