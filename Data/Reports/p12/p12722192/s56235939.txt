                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except
 for a small linear focus of atelectasis or scarring at the left base.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident, and there is no chest
 radiographic evidence of an acute, displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No chest radiographic evidence of acute, displaced rib fracture or
 pneumothorax.  If pain is localized to a specific rib, dedicated rib views
 with markers may be helpful for more complete assessment if warranted
 clinically.
