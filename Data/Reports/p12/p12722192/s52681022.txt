                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  On chemotherapy with cough.  History of myeloma.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacity in the left
 lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis and appears similar compared to the
 prior radiograph.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Compression fracture of a low thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged as are expansile lesions involving the left 8th rib posteriorly.
 Additionally, deformity of the right clavicular head is unchanged and
 compatible with known myeloma. Clips from prior cholecystectomy are noted in
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.  Multiple osseous lesions
 compatible with known myeloma, better demonstrated on the PET-CT from ___.
