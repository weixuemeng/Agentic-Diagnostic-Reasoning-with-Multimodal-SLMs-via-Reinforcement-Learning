                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged, increased compared to the
 prior study.  The mediastinal contour is similar.  Left PICC tip terminates in
 the upper SVC.  There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval, with new
 layering small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, increased in the interval with new
 small to moderate size bilateral layering pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded in
 correct setting
