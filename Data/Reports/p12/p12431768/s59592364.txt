                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Evaluation is somewhat
 limited due to underpenetration and low lung volumes on the frontal projection
 though allowing for this there is no focal consolidation effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size appears top-normal though this appears stable. 
 No signs of pneumomediastinum.  No overt signs of edema.  Bony structures
 appear intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute abnormalities.  Top normal heart size.
