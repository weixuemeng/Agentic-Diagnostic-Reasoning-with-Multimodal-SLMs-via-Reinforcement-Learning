                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.  The increased cardiac silhouette is redemonstrated and appears to be
 unchanged at least since ___.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Right lower lung atelectasis is
 unchanged.  No new consolidations demonstrated to suggest infectious process.
 
 The lateral view shows new opacity projecting behind the carina at the level
 of the aortic arch and unclear if represents summation of shadows or new
 pulmonary lesion.  Reassessment with chest CT would be beneficial for this
 patient.
