                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diffuse wheezing, rhonchi, new cough and subjective
 fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is slight increase
 in interstitial markings bilaterally, which could be due to mild edema versus
 atypical infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  Mild increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally may relate to mild edema and appear decreased compared to the
 prior study; however, atypical infection is not entirely excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
