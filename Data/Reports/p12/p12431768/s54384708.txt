                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and new tachypnea.  Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are very low and the film is somewhat underpenetrated.
 Faint bibasilar opacities are similar to yesterday's study and may reflect
 mild atelectasis; however, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be completely
 excluded.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is calcification of the aortic arch.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint bibasilar opacities in the setting of low lung volumes may
 reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical
 setting cannot be completely excluded.
