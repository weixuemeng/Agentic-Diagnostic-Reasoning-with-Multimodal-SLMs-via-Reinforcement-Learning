 Mild cardiomegaly is new.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Opacities
 in the lingula and right middle lobe could represent atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia, followup after treatment is recommended in six weeks.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips projecting in the mediastinum are again noted. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
