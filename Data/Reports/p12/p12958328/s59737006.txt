                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female recently discharged from the hospital after
 acute on chronic pancreatitis, now with mild dyspnea, lower extremity edema,
 and fever, here to evaluate for acute heart failure or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show improved
 consolidation in the right lower lobe and minimal improvement in left lower
 lobe consolidation.  There is persistent opacification at the right medial
 lung which may represent right middle lobe atelectasis or pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly
 increased from ___.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged, and no pulmonary edema is detected.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits with a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Surgical clips are again seen
 projecting over the superior mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent opacification of the right medial lung consistent with right
 middle lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
 2.  Improved mild bibasilar opacification from ___.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased from ___.  No
 findings to suggest acute heart failure.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at
