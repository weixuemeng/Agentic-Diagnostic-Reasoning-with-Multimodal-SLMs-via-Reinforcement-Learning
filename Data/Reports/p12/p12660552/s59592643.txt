                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with fever after endarterectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema has cleared.  There could be a ___ to 15 mm nodule lateral to
 the left hilus.  Granulomatous calcifications are present in hilar lymph nodes
 bilaterally.  Right lung is clear.  Heart size normal.
 
 Internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No complications associated with
 it.
 
 Evaluation of the lung nodule should begin with a search for prior chest
 radiographs for purposes of comparison, and if this is a new finding, as I
 suspect it is, I would obtain shallow oblique views to see if it is a real
 finding.  Dr. ___ was paged at 12:10 p.m.
