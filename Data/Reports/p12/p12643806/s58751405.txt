                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of interstitial lung disease and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are reduced. There
 are diffuse interstitial opacities, most pronounced within the lung bases and
 more so in the left lung base compared to the right.  Additionally,
 bronchiectatic changes are also most pronounced within the lung bases, with
 bronchial wall thickening.  Increased opacification within the left lung base
 compared to the prior radiograph may suggest the presence of a superimposed
 infection or atelectasis.  Assessment of the lateral view is limited due to
 the patient's inability to raise her left arm, and a left humeral prosthesis
 is imaged.  No definite pleural effusion is seen. There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The hilar contours appear relatively unchanged, with
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  No pneumothorax is present.  Bilateral old rib deformities are
 present.  Compression deformities of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies are
 present and unchanged compared to the prior CT.  Mild compression deformity of
 an upper lumbar vertebral body is also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Chronic interstitial lung disease, with slightly increased opacity in the
 left lung base, which could represent superimposed infection or atelectasis.
