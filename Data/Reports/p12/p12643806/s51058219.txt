                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath and fluid overload.  Assess after
 diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Interpretation of these radiographs is limited due to the technique and
 rotation of the patient, allowing this limitation diffuse interstitial
 opacities have improved from prior study.  Moderate cardiomegaly is probably
 stable.  Widened mediastinum cannot be assessed.  Right PICC tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction or at the upper right atrium.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax. Left shoulder arthroplasty is again noted.  NG tube tip is in
 the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema now mild.
