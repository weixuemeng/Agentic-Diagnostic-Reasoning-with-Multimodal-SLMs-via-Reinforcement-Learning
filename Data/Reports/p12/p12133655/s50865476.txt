                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis/ dyspnea in presence of CHF and
 liver failure and hx of tuberculosis  // r/o tuberculosis vs. pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval development of interstitial opacities predominantly at
 the lung bases, most likely representing pulmonary edema. There is fluid
 within the right minor fissure. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions
 or pleural thickening.
 
 There is also the suggestion of a right infrahilar mass or dense
 consolidation, warranting evaluation with CT scanning.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal, but unchanged in size. Left chest
 wall pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle. The imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible right lower lung mass or pneumonia; Chest CT recommended.
 
 Interval development of mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
