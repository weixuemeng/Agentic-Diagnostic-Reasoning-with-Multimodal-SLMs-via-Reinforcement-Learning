                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, hypotension  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated towards the left and the chin obscures the upper lung
 apices, bilaterally.  Additionally, lung volumes are low leading to crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  Within these limitations, there is mild
 cardiomegaly and central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left retrocardiac
 streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no lobar consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, and mild central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
