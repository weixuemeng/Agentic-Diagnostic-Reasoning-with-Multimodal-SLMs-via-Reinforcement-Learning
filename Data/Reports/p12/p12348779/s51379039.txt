                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 12:30 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the NG tube beneath G-tube/mediastinal drains and
 left chest tube have been removed.  A right IJ central line is present,
 unchanged, tip over the right atrium.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 As before, there are sternotomy wires, with prominence of cardiomediastinal
 silhouette consistent with recent surgery.  There is increased retrocardiac
 density, slightly worse than on the prior film, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Small left effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Mild vascular plethora, possibly slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse than ___. 
 Vascular plethora possibly slightly improved since then.
