                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 are probably trace pleural effusions.  A mild interstitial abnormality appears
 unchanged.  Fissures appear more thickened, but there is no evidence for
 parenchymal edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected trace new pleural effusions and thickened fissures
 which may indicate slight fluid overload, but otherwise no significant change
 in a mild interstitial abnormality which is most likely to reflect airway
 inflammation.
