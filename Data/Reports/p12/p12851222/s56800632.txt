                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent chronic, diffuse, mild increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally, similar to prior dating back to at least ___.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic, diffuse increase in interstitial markings.  Slight
 increase in opacity at the right lung base is felt to more likely be due to
 atelectasis rather than consolidation.
