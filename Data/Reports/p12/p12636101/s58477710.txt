                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fatigue, poor po intake  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes are noted with crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  Bibasilar opacities are identified. There is no effusion,
 pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly
 enlarged but likely accentuated due to lower lung volumes. No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis although pneumonia would be
 possible particularly at the right lung base in the proper clinical setting.
