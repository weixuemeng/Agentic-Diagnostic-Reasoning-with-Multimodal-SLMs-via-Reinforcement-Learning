                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with a stroke  // ?infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Subtle asymmetry of
 the right hemi thorax compared to the left on the frontal radiograph may be
 due to a technical artifact due to lack of patient centering. No corresponding
 opacity is observed on the lateral radiograph appear No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia. Subtle asymmetry in density of the 2 lungs on the
 frontal radiograph is likely technical in nature, but a repeat frontal
 radiograph may be considered to exclude early infection in the right lung if
 warranted clinically.
