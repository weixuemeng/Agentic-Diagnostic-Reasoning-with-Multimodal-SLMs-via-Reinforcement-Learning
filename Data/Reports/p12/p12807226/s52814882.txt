                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with subarachnoid hemorrhage, fall  // please
 evaluate for traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and low lung
 volumes.  While there is mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures, no
 overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung
 bases without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified on this supine exam.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Patchy atelectasis in the
 lung bases.
