                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal perforation during recent ERCP.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent abdominal radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending within
 the stomach.  Note is made of a biliary catheter as well as surgical clips in
 the epigastric region.
 
 There is a moderate quantity of left pleural fluid with consolidation at the
 left lung base that could be compressive atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Heart size is difficult to accurately assess but is likely top normal.
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no evidence of
 pneumomediastinum.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 There is a moderate quantity of what appears to be both intraperitoneal and
 retroperitoneal free air.  The retroperitoneal air is better evaluated on the
 subsequent abdominal radiograph from ___, where free air is seen
 outlining the right kidney and psoas muscle.  High-density material within the
 colon relates to prior ingestion of oral contrast material.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate quantity of free air that appears to be located in both
 intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal locations.  If clinically warranted,
 further evaluation could be performed with CT.
 
 2.  Moderate quantity of left pleural fluid, possibly transudative in nature,
 although hemorrhagic material related to esophageal perforation is certainly
 possible.  Associated consolidative opacification of the left lung base could
 be compressive atelectasis.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:47 p.m. via
 telephone on the day of the study, immediately after discovery of the
 findings.
