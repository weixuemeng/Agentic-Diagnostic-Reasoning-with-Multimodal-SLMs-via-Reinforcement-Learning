 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged.  There is mild interstitial
 prominence as well as upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity
 suggesting mild vascular congestion.  There is patchy opacification with a
 streaky character projecting over the right upper lung as well as the
 retrocardiac area, which appears unchanged.  These areas are likely to reflect
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia is difficult to exclude, however.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful particularly if pulmonary symptoms were to persist.
