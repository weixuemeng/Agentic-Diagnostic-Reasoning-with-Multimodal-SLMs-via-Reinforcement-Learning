 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the cardiac silhouette continues to be
 substantially enlarged and signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema still
 present. The atelectatic changes in the right lung have minimally decreased,
 reflecting improved ventilation. The probably atelectatic opacity at the left
 lung base is constant in appearance.  No new parenchymal opacities. No larger
 pleural effusions.
