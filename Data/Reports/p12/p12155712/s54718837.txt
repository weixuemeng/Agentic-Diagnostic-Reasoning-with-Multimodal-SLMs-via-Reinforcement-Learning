                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fall, fever  // presence of infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and left humerus films from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings. Right midlung opacity seen laterally could potentially represent
 atelectasis. There is no effusion or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at
 the aortic arch with tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta. Chronic
 changes seen at the proximal left humerus which is incompletely visualized,
 suggestive of Paget's disease as on prior dedicated views.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with right lung opacity laterally potentially atelectasis
 although clinical correlation is suggested regarding possibility of infection.
 Otherwise no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
