                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with liver disease, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear opacities are re- demonstrated within
 the mid lung fields bilaterally, with slight interval improvement in
 previously noted patchy opacities in the left upper and lower lung fields. 
 More focal opacity is noted within the right upper lobe, which appears more
 conspicuous than on the previous radiograph.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. More conspicuous focal opacity within the right upper lobe which has been
 present since ___.  As suggested on the prior chest radiograph, CT is
 recommended for further assessment.
 2. Interval improvement in previously noted patchy opacities in the left upper
 and lower lung fields.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  As suggested on the prior chest radiograph, CT is
 recommended for further assessment.
