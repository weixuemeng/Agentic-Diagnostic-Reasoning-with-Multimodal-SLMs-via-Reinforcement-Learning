                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presenting for
 evaluation of progressively worsening altered mental status and weakness. 
 Denies recent trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval improvement in the previously seen left upper lobe and left
 lower lobe opacities consistent with gradual resolution of infection or
 aspiration.  A subtle opacity is also seen within the right upper lobe which
 may have been present on the prior radiograph in ___, and therefore an
 underlying parenchymal lesion cannot be excluded.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Plate-like atelectasis is noted at the left
 lung base.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial but partial improvement in the left mid and lower lobe opacities
 consistent with gradual resolution of an underlying infectious process. 
 Subtle right upper lobe opacity may have been present since ___, and CT
 chest should be obtained to exclude an underlying parenchymal nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest for further evaluation of possible multifocal
 pneumonia and co-existing right upper lobe nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings and recommendation were telephoned to Dr.
 ___ by ___ on ___ at 9:40AM, approximately 20 minutes
 after attending readout.
