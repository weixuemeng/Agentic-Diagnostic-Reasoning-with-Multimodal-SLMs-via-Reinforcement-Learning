                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p minimally invasive three hole esophagectomy for lower
 SCC, T3N2M0,IIB, s/p neoadjuv chemoRT  // Interval assesment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior comparisons most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction as before.  An enteric tube terminates
 just past the GE junction.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Previously
 seen perihilar edema has improved from the prior examination. A left basal
 opacity is decreased in size from the prior examination consistent with
 pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapsed. Mild right basal atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as above.
 2. Left basal opacity is decreased in size from the prior examination
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and effusion.
 3. Minimal right basal atelectasis.  Postoperative pneumoperitoneum persists.
 4. Perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved from the prior
 exam.
