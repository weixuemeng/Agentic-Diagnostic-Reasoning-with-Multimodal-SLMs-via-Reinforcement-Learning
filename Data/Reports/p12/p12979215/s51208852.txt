                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sarcoidosis and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CTA chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable prominence of the bilateral hilar regions, more so
 on the left than the right, and consistent with the patient's known hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  This is not significantly changed from the prior chest
 radiograph.  There is no consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  An irregularity of the right posterior sixth rib likely
 reflects a prior healed fracture.  This is unchanged in appearance from the
 prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable bilateral mild hilar lymphadenopathy which is compatible with the
 patient's history of sarcoidosis.
 2.  Stable appearance of an old right sixth rib fracture.
 3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
