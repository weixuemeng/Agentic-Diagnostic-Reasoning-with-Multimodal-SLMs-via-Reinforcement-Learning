                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia diagnosed elsewhere.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the latest examination available from an outside
 hospital dated ___, there is again low lung volumes with elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the left base.  No
 evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 No focal pneumonia, though the possibility of an occult basilar process would
 have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
