                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube assessment requested.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-supine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, where it
 terminates.  Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Very vague asymmetric hazy opacity projects over the left mid
 lung, uncertain in significance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild hazy opacifications involving the left mid lung; differential
 considerations include aspiration, pneumonia or other possibilities such as
 hemorrhage or asymmetric edema.  Short-term follow-up radiographs are
 suggested.
