                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of asthma exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 linear-type opacity in the right upper lung may represent atelectasis although
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  No additional areas of abnormal
 opacification are seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Of note, there is a partially imaged prominent loop of bowel in the
 abdomen on the frontal view although difficult to discern whether small bowel
 or colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle linear focal opacity in the right upper lobe most likely
 represents atelectasis although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
