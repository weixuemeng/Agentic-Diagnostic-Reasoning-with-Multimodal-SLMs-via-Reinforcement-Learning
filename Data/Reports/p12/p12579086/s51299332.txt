                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased shortness of breath, high risk
 for aspiration  // Evaluate for aspiration, increased pulmonary edema,
 atelectasis      Evaluate for aspiration, increased pulmonary edema,
 atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is mild improvement in
 aeration at the right base.  This could reflect decrease collapse of the right
 middle and lower lobes, presumably related to a expectoration of mucous
 plugging, and mild decrease in the degree of pleural effusion.  The left
 hemithorax remains essentially clear.
