                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is somewhat limited by patient rotation.  An endotracheal tube is in
 standard position, terminating approximately 4.2 cm from the carina. An
 orogastric tube tip is within the distal esophagus and needs further
 advancement. There is worsening volume loss in the right lung with increased
 opacification most likely reflective of worsening collapse. A moderate size
 right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. Additionally there is rightward
 shift of mediastinal structures. The aorta is diffusely calcified. The left
 lung remains clear. No pneumothorax identified.  Multiple clips are noted
 within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increasing volume loss and opacification in the right lung likely reflects
 worsening collapse with persistent moderate size right pleural effusion.
 2. Endotracheal tube in standard position. Orogastric tube needs to be
 advanced as the tip is within the distal esophagus.
