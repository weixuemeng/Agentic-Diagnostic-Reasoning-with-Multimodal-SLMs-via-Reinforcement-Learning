                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new SOB, oxygen requirement. History of
 mucus plugging.  // ? pulm edema / plugging
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly improved when compared to the prior study with
 increased aeration of the right lung base.  A previously seen right pleural
 effusion appears to have decreased however there is new airspace opacity seen
 in the right middle and right lower lobe.  This may reflect re-expansion
 pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature consistent with background congestive heart failure. 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  Deformity of the right shoulder consistent with an
 old fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration overall in the right lung base with improvement in the right
 pleural effusion.  However, there is new consolidation in this area which
 likely may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema or infection.  The right hilum
 appears prominent but this cannot be separated from the area of consolidation.
