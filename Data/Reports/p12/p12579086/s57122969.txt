 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Comparison with prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lateral view now shows
 a mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  The previously raised suspicion of
 a left lower lobe process cannot be substantiated.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
