  1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Apparent nodular density in the right base is likely the result of
  overlapping densities.  Oblique view radiographs could be obtained for
  confirmation, if clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with left sided weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Asymmetric density of the lung bases is related to right-sided mastectomy. 
 Apparent nodular density in the right lower lung is likely caused by A BENIGN
 CALCIFICATION IN LUNG OR RIB, OR VESSEL, EITHER ON END OR CROSSING.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal contour is normal. The osseous structures and upper
 abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. SMALL BENIGN CALCIFICATION OR VESSEL  SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR A
 CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT RIGHT LUNG NODULE.
