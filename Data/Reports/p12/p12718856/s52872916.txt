 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Peribronchial cuffing is
 present in the right juxtahilar region, and could potentially be due to acute
 bronchitis. Predominantly linear right juxtahilar and bibasilar opacities most
 likely represent atelectasis, but a short-term followup radiograph may be
 helpful to exclude an early focus of pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
