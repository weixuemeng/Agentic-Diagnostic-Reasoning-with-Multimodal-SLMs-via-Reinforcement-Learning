 Lungs remain low following tracheal extubation.  There is more vascular
 engorgement and probably more right pleural effusion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but mediastinal venous
 engorgement also attests to volume overload.  No pneumothorax.  Right jugular
 line ends in the mid SVC alongside a left subclavian line.  No pneumothorax.
