                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large volume hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube and orogastric tube are unchanged in orientation,
 remaining within appropriate position.  Again seen are widespread bilateral
 pulmonary opacities, improved along the upper zones, in comparison to the ___ exam.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight improvement of widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities, particularly
 in the upper zones, likely reflecting hemorrhage in the setting of known
 history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and recent hemoptysis.
