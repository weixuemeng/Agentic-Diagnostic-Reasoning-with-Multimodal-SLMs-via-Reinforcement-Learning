 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed. The right PICC line has been
 repositioned, and now terminates in the upper SVC. The tip of the newly placed
 left sided dialysis catheter enters the right atrium.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Left perihilar and right mid lung airspace opacities may be due
 to atelectasis, but infection would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite
 the projection.
