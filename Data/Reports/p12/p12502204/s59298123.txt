                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Mild hyponatremia.  Question mass or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Noting soft tissue attenuation that obscures each
 costophrenic sulcus, it is difficult to exclude very small pleural effusion,
 although doubted.  The lungs appear clear.  The lungs appear hyperinflated. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.  There has been no significant change
 allowing for differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute disease.
