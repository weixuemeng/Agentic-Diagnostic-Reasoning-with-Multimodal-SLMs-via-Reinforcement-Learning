                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved lung
 volume in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting improved ventilation of the
 right lung.  The left hemithorax is unchanged.  Status post sternotomy. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid overload.  The presence of
 minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  No new parenchymal opacities
 have occurred in the interval.  The preexisting retrocardiac atelectasis is
 unchanged.
