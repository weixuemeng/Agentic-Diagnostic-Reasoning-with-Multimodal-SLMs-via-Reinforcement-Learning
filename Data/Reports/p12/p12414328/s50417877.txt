                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  No large pleural effusions are
 seen, but small pleural effusions to be difficult to exclude.  Right base
 opacity most likely represents a prominent vascular structure, although
 underlying consolidation due to aspiration or infection not excluded. 
 Mediastinum is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly.  Difficult to exclude
 small pleural effusions.  Patchy right base opacity may relate to prominent
 vascular structures, although underlying consolidation from aspiration or
 infection may be present.
