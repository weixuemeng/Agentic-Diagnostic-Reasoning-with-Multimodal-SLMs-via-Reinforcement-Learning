                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, prior AST
 presenting with cardiac arrest and complaints of mid epigastric and chest
 pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest x-ray is somewhat oblique in positioning
 accounting for differences in cardiac contour compared to prior study from
 ___.  Even accounting for this, the cardiac silhouette is large. 
 Central pulmonary vasculature appears mildly full on the right, but is
 obscured on the left because of patient obliquity.  Small left pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded and there is obscuration of left hemidiaphragm
 related to some combination of small effusion and/or subsegmental retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
 
 CONCLUSION:   Cardiomegaly with probable central pulmonary vascular congestion
 sggesting early CHF.  If the patient is able, lateral view and or repeat
 better-penetrated PA view is recommended to evaluate the left lung base where
 there is suggestion of consolidation and/or small effusion.
