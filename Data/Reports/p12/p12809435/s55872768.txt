                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with leukocytosis, low-grade fever and intermittent
 non-productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs.
 
 Frontal view shows normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural
 surfaces.  Two filamentous opacities on the lateral view projecting over the
 anterior heart could be external artifacts.  If there is reason to suspect
 internally retained wire fragments, such as from a previous wire-guided
 procedure, the area can be inspected either fluoroscopically or with chest CT.
 Clinical correlation, however, is essential.
