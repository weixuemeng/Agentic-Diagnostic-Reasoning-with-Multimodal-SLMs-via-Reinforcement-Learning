                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male who presents for followup of previously seen
 pulmonic infiltrates in the central location.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be interval resolution of the pulmonic infiltrates
 previously seen.  No new infiltrates are seen. There is a persistent lucency
 in the lung parenchyma adjacent to the left hilum that appears stable since
 ___, which maybe suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality,
 congenital or otherwise. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval resolution of the central pneumonic infiltrates previously seen.
 
 2. Persistent lucent underlying structural abnormality in the lung parenchyma
 adjacent to the left hilum. This may be congenital in nature, however if
 clinically indicated/necessary, CT would provide better characterization of
 this abnormality.
