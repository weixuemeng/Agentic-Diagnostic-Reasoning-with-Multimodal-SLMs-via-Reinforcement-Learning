 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with temperature and cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable and unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  There is a mild degree of hilar prominence and just
 laterally and above the hilum, but still in central position, there are
 parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic character.  With the exception of a small
 peripheral atelectasis on the left lung base, no other pulmonary abnormalities
 can be identified and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from
 any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the
 frontal view.
 
 Preview of the preceding chest examination of ___ confirms the,
 at that time, normal finding, but on the lateral view, mild prominence of the
 central pulmonary vessels was already present.  This finding with more
 prominent hilar structures on the lateral view is noted around this finding. 
 The pulmonary infiltrates are seen in central location.
 
 Pneumonic infiltrates in rather unusual central location.  No other
 cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 Telephone call was established with referring physician, ___. ___ at 4:00
