                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic lung cancer and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Re- demonstrated is extensive nodular pleural thickening involving the right
 lung compatible with metastatic pleural disease.  Persistent opacification
 within the right lung base appears to represent a combination of right basilar
 atelectasis and small right effusion with known pleural deposits.  Overall,
 compared to the prior chest radiograph, disease within the right lung appears
 to have progressed, but appears unchanged compared to the most recent chest
 CTA allowing for differences in technique.  Multiple nodules within the left
 lung have also increased in size and number compared to the prior chest
 radiograph.  Small left pleural effusion is new compared to the prior chest
 radiograph but was seen on the prior chest CT.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear relatively unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous lesion is definitively noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Compared to the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval progression of
 disease with increased size and number of pulmonary nodules, and worsening
 metastatic disease within the right hemithorax.  Small left pleural effusion. 
 Persistent right basilar opacification reflecting a combination of pleural
 effusion, right basilar atelectasis, and pleural based disease.
