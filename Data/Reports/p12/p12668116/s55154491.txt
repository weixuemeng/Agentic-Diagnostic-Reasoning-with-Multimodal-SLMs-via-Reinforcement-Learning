                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic RCC with known pulmonary mets with worsening dyspnea. 
 Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-erect AP views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen is
 extensive nodular pleural thickening involving the right lung compatible with
 metastatic pleural disease.  Persistent opacification is seen within the right
 lung base, unchanged from ___.  Multiple nodular opacities in the
 left lung were better appreciated on prior study since there are low lung
 volumes on the current study and left base opacity. There is new opacification
 of the left lung base, which could be related to effusion, however, cannot
 exclude consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from
 prior exam. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared to the prior chest radiograph, there is a new left lung
 base opacity, which could represent effusion, however, cannot exclude
 consolidation.  There is stable appearance of the right lung base opacity. 
 Known bilateral pulmonary metastases, better assessed on CT.
