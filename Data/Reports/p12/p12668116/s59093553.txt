 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cancer, hemoptysis, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:45 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the
 bibasilar consolidations, right more than left, are comparable to the previous
 exam.  Slightly increased lung density in the region of the right lung apex is
 also unchanged and could represent mild pulmonary edema.  Finally, an area of
 left lateral pleural thickening is also constant.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged low lung volumes, unchanged left-sided drain.
