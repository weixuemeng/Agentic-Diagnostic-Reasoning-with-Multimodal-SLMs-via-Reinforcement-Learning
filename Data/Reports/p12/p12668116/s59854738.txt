                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recurrent pleural effusions from metastatic renal cell
 carcinoma status post right-sided pleurodesis.
 
 CHEST
 
 Position of the right chest tube is unchanged.  Increasing density is seen
 over the right lung when compared to the prior chest x-ray and some of this
 may be due to the underpenetration but likely increasing effusion is present. 
 Atelectasis at the right base is again noted.  The left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing density likely representing effusion.
