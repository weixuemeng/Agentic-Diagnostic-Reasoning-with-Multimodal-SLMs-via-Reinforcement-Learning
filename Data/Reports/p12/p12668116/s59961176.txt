                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cancer and pleural effusion.  Now
 with worsening oxygen requirement, evaluate for worsening.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study
 obtained four hours earlier during the same day.  Evidence of bilateral
 pleural effusion and thickening of the pleural spaces along the lateral chest
 walls as before.  Pulmonary congestive pattern with perivascular haze in
 pulmonary circulation.  No evidence of new discrete parenchymal infiltrates. 
 Inspirational effort somewhat less than on next preceding portable study. 
 Quantification of pleural density and translate into amount of free pleural
 effusion is impossible on single view portable chest examination.
