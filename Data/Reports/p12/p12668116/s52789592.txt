                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusion and pleurodesis. Renal cell carcinoma
 with pulmonary metastases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate sized right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared
 to the prior exam.  Adjacent opacification within the right lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded, and the
 degree of opacification has slightly worsened compared to the prior exam.
 Irregular nodular pleural thickening on the right extends to the lung apex and
 appears progressed in the interval. Multiple left lung nodules are again
 demonstrated, better seen on the prior CT, compatible with metastases.  There
 is no left-sided pleural effusion, new focal consolidation, or pneumothorax
 identified.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 although the cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence
 of the right-sided pleural effusion.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Unchanged moderate sized right pleural effusion. Nodular pleural thickening
 in the right hemithorax appears progressed in the interval and likely reflects
 worsening pleural metastases.
 
 2.  Right basilar opacification likely reflects atelectasis though infection
 is difficult to exclude, and appears minimally worse when compared to the
 prior exam.  
 
 3.  Relatively unchanged left lung pulmonary nodules, compatible with
 metastases.
