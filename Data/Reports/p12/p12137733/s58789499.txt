                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neck pain and chest pain after MVC, rule out pneumothorax or
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal lateral views of the chest were performed.
 
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal airspace consolidation. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  The hilar and pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  There are no
 displaced rib fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.  
 2.  No displaced rib fracture.  If concern for fracture persists, a dedicated
 rib series with markers would be useful.
