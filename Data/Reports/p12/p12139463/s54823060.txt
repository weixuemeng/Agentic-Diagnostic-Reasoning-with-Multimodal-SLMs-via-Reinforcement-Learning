                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG with chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 have all been removed except for the right IJ catheter.  There may be a tiny
 apical pneumothorax on the right.
 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base with blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggesting pleural fluid.  No vascular congestion.
