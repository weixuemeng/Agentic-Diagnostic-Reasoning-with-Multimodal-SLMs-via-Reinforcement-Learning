                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough, smoker, ___-pound weight loss, infiltrative process
 to rule out cancer or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest x-ray.  Abdominal CT done yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, but there is no focal lesion.  Mediastinal
 and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Except for hyperinflation, the remaining of the lungs are unremarkable.
