                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, fever. Assess for infection or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate slightly lower lung volumes
 from previous examination with bibasilar atelectasis. New triangular-shaped
 retrocardiac opacity with mild obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. No
 additional focal opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. Interval removal of right PICC
 line.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures again demonstrates a vertebral
 stabilization device. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New triangular retrocardiac opacity is most consistent atelectasis.
