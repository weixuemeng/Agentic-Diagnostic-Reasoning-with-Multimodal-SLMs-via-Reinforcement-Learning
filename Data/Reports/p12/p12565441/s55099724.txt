 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pleural catheter is seen but appears to been repositioned.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  There is persistent patchy opacity at the left
 base with an associated effusion which may reflect atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  Perihilar vascular
 congestion is again seen with improvement in the mild interstitial edema.  1.8
 cm nodular opacity in the left upper lobe for which correlation to the outside
 chest CT would be recommended as the images from this study are not fully
 available on our PACs system.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
