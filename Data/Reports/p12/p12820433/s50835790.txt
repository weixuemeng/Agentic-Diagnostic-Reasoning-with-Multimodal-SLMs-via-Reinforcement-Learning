  Interval placement of a left chest tube, which may have partly intrafissural
  course. There is been subsequent improvement in the left pleural effusion,
  still moderate to large. Improved aeration of the left upper lobe with streaky
  opacities, which may represent re-expansion pulmonary edema. Right lung is
  essentially clear.  No pneumothorax.  Left subclavian line in unchanged
  position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new L chest tube  // ? placement, ? pTX
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided
 chest drain. The extent of the pre-existing pleural fluid collection is
 substantially decreased. As a consequence, the left lung is better ventilated
 than on the previous image.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung
 volume on the right has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The
 position of the left subclavian vein catheter is unchanged.
