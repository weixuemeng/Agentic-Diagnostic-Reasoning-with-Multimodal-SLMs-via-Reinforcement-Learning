 INDICATION:  ___ man with a h/o anxiety / depression, recent multifocal
 pneumonia and other issues admitted with recurrent pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, respiratory distress, and vasopressor-dependent hypotension.  // Is
 there any evidence of movement of the L chest tube?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph from earlier the same date, there has been
 interval Interval slight apparent change in position of left pigtail pleural
 catheter with focal kinking as described in the WET READ report.  Moderate
 left pleural effusion is similar, and continues to demonstrate a loculated
 hydro pneumothorax component laterally as well as a possible tiny left apical
 pneumothorax. Slight worsening of adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis. No
 other relevant changes.
