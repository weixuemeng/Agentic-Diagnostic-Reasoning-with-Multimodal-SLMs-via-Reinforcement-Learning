                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right middle lobe pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the transparency of the
 right middle lobe has increased and the volume loss of the middle lobe has
 decreased.  However, the volume has not returned to normal and the lateral
 radiograph continues to display a mild decrease in transparency.  Lack of
 incomplete resolution suggests that the patient should be followed until
 complete resolution of the pre-existing pneumonia is documented.
 
 There are no pleural effusions.  No other parenchymal changes.  Normal hilar
 and mediastinal contours.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pulmonary edema.
