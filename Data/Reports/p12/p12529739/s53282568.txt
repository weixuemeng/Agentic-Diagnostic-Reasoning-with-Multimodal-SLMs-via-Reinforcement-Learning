                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with asthma flare and right basilar rhonchi,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with concurrent
 inferior displacement of the right minor fissure towards the lung base which
 suggests volume loss of the middle lobe.  Better seen on the lateral
 radiograph, is a right middle lobe hazy parenchymal opacity with air
 bronchograms which may represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is no other focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. There is no evidence of overinflation.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy infiltrate in the right middle lobe which may represent
 atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be excluded.
