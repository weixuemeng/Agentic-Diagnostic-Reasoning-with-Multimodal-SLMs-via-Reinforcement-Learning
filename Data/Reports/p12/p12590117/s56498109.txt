                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:50 A.M. ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with polytrauma.  Check endotracheal and
 chest tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:50 p.m.:
 
 Very small right pneumothorax is decreasing, pleural tube unchanged in
 position in the right upper hemithorax.  Tubular lucency to the left of the
 midline from the aortic knob to the level of the diaphragm is probably a
 medial pneumothorax, alternatively a distended esophagus.  It is not
 pneumomediastinum, which would have migrated over the past several hours. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis is improving.  ET tube is in standard placement. 
 Nasogastric tube has been advanced to the upper stomach.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.  Left subclavian vascular introducer is unchanged in
 position.  Many rib fractures are present on both sides of the chest,
 involving at least the right sixth through ninth and left sixth and seventh,
 but conventional radiographs will consistently underestimate the number of
 fractures and are inadequate to assess changing displacements.
