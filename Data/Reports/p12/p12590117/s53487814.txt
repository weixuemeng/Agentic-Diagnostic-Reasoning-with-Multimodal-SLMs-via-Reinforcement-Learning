                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Per the clinical team, pressures obtained from the left central line was
 compatible with it being in an intravenous location.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New chest tubes bilaterally and new left subclavian central venous
 catheter.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:15.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral chest tubes are present, both projecting over the region of the lung
 apices.  Endotracheal tube remains in standard position.  Orogastric tube is
 seen with tip coursing below the diaphragm, within the stomach, though the
 side port is above the gastroesophageal junction should be advanced by at
 least 5 cm.  Left subclavian catheter tip appears to be malpositioned,
 terminating at the region of the aortic knob, and is likely intra-arterial. 
 
 Remainder of the chest is unchanged. Persistent dense consolidation within the
 retrocardiac region is noted with a moderate left hemothorax.  There is
 continued oblong lucency overlying the cardiac silhouette compatible with a
 left pneumothorax.  Deep sulcus sign on the right is incompletely imaged, and
 compatible with a small right pneumothorax.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures
 are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Intra-arterial positioning of the left subclavian catheter.
 
 2. Persistent bilateral pneumothoraces status post bilateral chest tube
 placement.  Continued left hemothorax, moderate in extent.
 
 3. Suboptimal positioning of orogastric tube with the side port above the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend advancement by at least 5 cm.
 
 4.  Persistent dense retrocardiac consolidation.
