 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New chest tube placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:28 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 second new right chest tube.  The chest tube appears to be in correct
 position.  The extent of the known right pneumothorax has decreased.  The
 current image shows an apparently fully expanded right lung.
 
 The other monitoring and support devices, including the left chest tube, the
 endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the right central venous access
 line are constant.  No evidence of tension.  Unchanged appearance of the lung
 parenchyma bilaterally and of the cardiac silhouette.
