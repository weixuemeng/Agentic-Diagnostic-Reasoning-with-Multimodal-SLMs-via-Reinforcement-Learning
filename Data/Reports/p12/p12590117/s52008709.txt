                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bilateral chest tubes with ongoing leak on
 the right.  Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT dated ___ and radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right subclavian
 approach central venous catheter with tip in the mid SVC and an enteric tube
 with tip in the stomach.  Bilateral chest tubes are in place, with interval
 change of configuration of the right chest tube as well as increased
 subcutaneous emphysema, suggestive of interval replacement of the right tube
 with the tip now tilting cephalad towards the mediastinum.  There is now a
 tiny right apical pneumothorax and a small right lateral basilar pneumothorax,
 presumably related to interval placement of new chest tube.  Triangular
 lucency overlying the left paraspinal line projecting over the heart is
 unchanged, consistent with a left medial pneumothorax.  There is more
 pronounced right basilar atelectasis.  Retrocardiac atelectasis in the left
 base is persistent.  Prominent cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 
 A mildly displaced right third rib fracture is noted, as are multilevel
 minimally displaced left posterolateral rib fractures.  Overall extent of
 injury is better delineated on prior CT dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apparent interval exchange of right chest tube with small right latearl
 basal pneumothorax with a tiny apical component.  Persistent medial left
 pneumothorax and stable left chest tube.
 
 2.  Multilevel rib fractures and bibasilar atelectasis.
