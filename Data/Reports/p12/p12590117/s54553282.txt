                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with polytrauma, here for assessment of interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates similar extent of
 subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.  There has been interval
 removal of one of the two indwelling right chest tubes.  A left-sided chest
 tube remains similar in location.  
 
 The heart is enlarged, but unchanged.  Perihilar vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema appears similar as compared to prior exam.  There is no
 discernable pneumothorax.  There is persistent lucency projecting over medial
 left hilus, which upon correlation with prior CT dated ___ likely
 represents posterior medial pleural air collection. 
 
 The lung bases demonstrate ill-defined opacities which could represent
 residual post-traumatic contusions.  There are bilateral pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis.  There is also marked distention of the azygos
 contour, in keeping with increased volume status.  The ET tube is stable and
 in appropriate position.  An enteric tube traverses inferiorly out of view.  A
 right central venous catheter is unchanged in location.  Multiple bilateral
 rib fractures, better discerned on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No relevant change.  Interval removal of one of the right chest
 tubes.
