                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Newly placed tracheostomy tube terminates 7.5 cm above the carina
 at the thoracic inlet level.  The tip apparently abutting the right lateral
 wall of the trachea, but this may be accentuated by leftward patient rotation.
 Attention to this finding on a repeat non-rotated radiograph would be helpful
 in this regard.  Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no evidence of
 left pneumothorax, and a resolving tiny right lateral pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion
 and improving perihilar edema.  Slight worsening of basilar lung opacities is
 noted, particularly in the right lower lobe, and could reflect asymmetrical
 dependent edema, but differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, aspiration
 and developing infectious pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are again
 demonstrated.
