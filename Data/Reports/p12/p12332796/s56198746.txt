 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Recent hospitalization, leukocytosis.  Questionable edema or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing small
 atelectasis at the right lung base has minimally increased in extent.  The
 atelectasis has a medial component, showing small air bronchograms and a
 plate-like component in more lateral right parts of the lung.  The change
 should be followed to exclude the possibility of early pneumonia.  Otherwise,
 the lung parenchyma is unchanged and normal.  No pleural effusions. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
