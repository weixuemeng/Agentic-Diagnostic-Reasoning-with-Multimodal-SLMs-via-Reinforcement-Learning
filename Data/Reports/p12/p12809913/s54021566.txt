                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with questioned abnormal aortic contour.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Mediastinal contour is essentially
 unremarkable and appears smaller when compared to prior from earlier the same
 day although slightly larger when compared to prior exam from ___ likely due
 to differences in technique.  The contour of the visualized aorta on the
 current exam is unchanged from remote prior without the irregularity seen on
 most recent prior.  Left greater than right bibasilar atelectasis is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Mediastinal contour on prior exam
 from earlier in the same day was likely due to technique and positioning. 
 Contour of the descending thoracic aorta on the current exam is unremarkable. 
 However if there is clinical concern for dissection CT would be more sensitive
 for evaluation.
