                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact appearing wires. 
 Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with prior CABG surgery. 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 prominent related in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Dense
 calcification of the aortic knob is re- demonstrated.  The lung volumes are
 decreased from the most recent prior study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are present.  Bibasilar opacification may represent atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes but superimposed infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical context.  There is interval development of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema with small
 bilateral pleural effusions, new from ___, is most compatible with
 an acute CHF exacerbation. 
 
 2. Bibasilar opacification most likely represents atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes; superimposed infection at the left lung base is doubted,
 but hard to exclude.
