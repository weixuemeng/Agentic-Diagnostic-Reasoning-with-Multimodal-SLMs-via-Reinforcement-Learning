                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There
 are prominent interstitial markings.  Reticular opacities are most pronounced
 at lung bases bilaterally.  There is no pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild apical scarring is noted. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Sternotomy wires are
 noted.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominent interstitial markings and reticular opacities, most pronounced
 in the lung bases may reflect interstitial edema or interstitial lung disease.
 2.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
