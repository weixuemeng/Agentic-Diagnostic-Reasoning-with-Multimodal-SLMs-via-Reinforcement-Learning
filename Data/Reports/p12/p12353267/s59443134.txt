                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  There appears to be some pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Prominence of the right hilum is stable.  Streaky left
 basilar opacity more likely relates to atelectasis than consolidation.  No
 large pleural effusion, although there is slight blunting of the posterior
 right costophrenic angle on the lateral view and a trace pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Again seen pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.
