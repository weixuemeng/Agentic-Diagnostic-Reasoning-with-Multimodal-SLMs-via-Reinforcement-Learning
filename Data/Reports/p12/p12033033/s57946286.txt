 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is a large
 hiatal hernia.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic
 spine with narrowing of a thoracolumbar interspace, probably T12-L1.  There
 are age-indeterminant non-displaced right-sided fourth and fifth rib
 fractures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Large hiatal hernia.  
 
 2.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  
 
 3.  Non-displaced right-sided rib fractures.
 
 There is an irregularity along the left anterior fifth rib seen on two
 dedicated right rib views, fracture that is age-indeterminate but not
 displaced.
