                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Respiratory failure  // ETT placement?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube remains in standard position.  Allowing for technical
 limitations including marked rightward rotation of the patient and incomplete
 imaging of the left hemi thorax, there has not been a relevant change in the
 appearance of the chest since recent study of 1 day earlier.  Repeat
 radiograph with improved positioning is suggested when feasible.
