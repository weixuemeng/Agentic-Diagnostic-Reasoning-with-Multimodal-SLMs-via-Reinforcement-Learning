                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has taken a
 lesser breath in.  As a consequence, the lung volumes are smaller and the
 heart appears minimally larger than before.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia and no pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema
 or other pathological changes.  The hilar and mediastinal structures are
 normal in appearance.
