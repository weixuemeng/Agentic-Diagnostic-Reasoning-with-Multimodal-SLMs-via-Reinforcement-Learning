                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Axillary and cervical masses suggesting lymphadenopathy.  Question
 nodules or infiltrates.  History of colon cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___.  A CT
 torso is available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is similar
 moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Streaky linear opacities persist,
 but have decreased in the left lower lung, suggesting minor atelectasis. 
 Patchy calcification in the right upper lobe also suggests minor scarring that
 is likewise unchanged.  Although radiography is not sensitive for small
 metastases, no definite suspicious findings are demonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild spinal curvature is similar.  Lower
 thoracic and upper lumbar compression deformities including two
 vertebroplasties appear unchanged.  The bones appear demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
