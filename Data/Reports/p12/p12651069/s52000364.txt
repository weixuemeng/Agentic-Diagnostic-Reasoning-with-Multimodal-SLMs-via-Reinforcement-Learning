 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Similar mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left is mild and
 unchanged.  A partly visualized deformity of the right shoulder is probably
 chronic and post-traumatic.  There has been no significant change.
