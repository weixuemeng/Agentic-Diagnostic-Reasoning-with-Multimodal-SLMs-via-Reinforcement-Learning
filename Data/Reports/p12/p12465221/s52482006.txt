                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and mouth soreness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is mildly tortuous
 and calcified.  Irregular pulmonary architecture again suggests emphysema, as
 seen on the prior chest CT.  There is a vague right infrahilar opacity, but
 similar to the prior examination suggesting minor chronic scarring or
 atelectasis.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  A mild superior endplate compression deformity along a lower
 thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with emphysema, but no definite acute
 process.
