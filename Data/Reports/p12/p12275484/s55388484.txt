 ADDENDUM  Second reference:  Acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia
 rather than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Chest, 132, ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and increased cough. stated was
 recently treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  A moderate size hiatal hernia is similar.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Diffuse airspace opacities are
 noted bilaterally with relative sparing of the lung bases, worse compared to
 the previous examinations.  There may be an element of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There appears to be a trace left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Deformity of the right mid clavicle is compatible
 with a remote fracture.  Remote compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body
 is also unchanged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Loose body
 adjacent to the left glenohumeral joint is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally, worse compared to the most recent
 chest radiograph.  Findings may reflect multifocal pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting.  Alternatively, this could reflect worsening of the
 patient's presumed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
 2. Possible element of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace left
 pleural effusion.
