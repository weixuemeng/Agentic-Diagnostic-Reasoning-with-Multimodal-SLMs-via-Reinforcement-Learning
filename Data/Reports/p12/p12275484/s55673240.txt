                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, sore throat, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lungs appear clear
 bilaterally without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  In the lateral view
 on the retrocardiac region, there is subtle nodular opacity, which in the
 correct clinical setting could indicate pneumonia.  There is also retrocardiac
 opacity on the frontal view, which raises concern for a hiatal hernia.  There
 is an old right clavicular shaft deformity.  Bony structures are otherwise
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacity in the retrocardiac region seen only on
 lateral view which in the correct clinical setting may represent pneumonia. 
 Possible hiatal hernia.
