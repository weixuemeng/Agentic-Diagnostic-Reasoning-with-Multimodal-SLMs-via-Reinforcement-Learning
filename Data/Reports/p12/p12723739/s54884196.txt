                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality,
 possibly attributable to pulmonary congestion.  Vague but more dense opacities
 can be seen in the lower lungs, greater on the left than right, in association
 with low lung volumes.  This appearance probably is due to a combination of
 mild atelectasis and pulmonary congestion.   
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild vascular congestion and basilar
 atelectasis.  If developing infection is a possible consideration, then
 short-term followup PA and lateral radiographs could be considered, however.
