                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with alzheimer's dementia with altered mental status
 and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is
 no pulmonary edema. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
