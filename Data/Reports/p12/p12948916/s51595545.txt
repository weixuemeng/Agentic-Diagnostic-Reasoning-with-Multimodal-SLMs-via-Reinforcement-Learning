                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening dementia and aggression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A focal
 onodular opacity projects along the inferior left anterior first costochondral
 junction and left upper lung, but if this is a bony prominence, is more
 distinct than on the prior study.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the left upper lobe and course of the left
 anterior first rib, probably due to degenerative hypertrophy at the
 costochrondral junction.  However, when clinically appropriate, repeat AP, AP
 lordotic, and bilateral oblique radiographs are recommended to reassess and
 exclude a lung nodule.
