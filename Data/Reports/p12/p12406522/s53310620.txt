                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 placement of a left IJ approach hemodialysis catheter, the tip of which
 projects over the right atrium.  A left upper extremity PICC tip projects over
 the mid SVC.  The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged and standard position. 
 The lungs appear hyperinflated, though this is unchanged. Slightly increased
 opacities are present in the left more than right upper lobes, otherwise the
 lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral air space and interstitial opacities with an upper lobe
 predominance appear similar or increased from recent priors, which could
 reflect an atypical distribution of pulmonary edema in this patient with
 underlying emphysema as documented on the ___ CT; further follow up
 chest radiographs will be required to confirm potential early pneumonia.
