                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD and hypoxic respiratory failure with
 increased O2 requirement.  Question interval change.  
 
 Comparison is made to ___.
 
 Single portable view of the chest demonstrates a left-sided hemodialysis line
 terminating at cavoatrial junction.  There is no overall gross change with no
 new focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Previously noted slight
 increase in density in the left apex is likely related to bony changes rather
 than an infectious process.  No evidence of pneumothorax or overt pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: No overall change from the prior radiograph.
