                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female who presents for evaluation of NG tube
 location.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is in place, the left-sided hemodialysis
 catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  The left-sided PIC line
 terminates in the mid SVC. The side ports of the NG tube are at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are
 identified. There is a slight increase in density at the left apex compared to
 the prior exam.  The heart size is stable.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. NG tube must be advanced as the side-port is likely at the gastroesophageal
 junction.
 
 2. Slight increase in density at the left apex could be secondary to an
 infectious process.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11am by Dr. ___ by
 telephone on the day of the exam.
