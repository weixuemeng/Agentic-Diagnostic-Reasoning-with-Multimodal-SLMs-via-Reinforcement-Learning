                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxic respiratory failure, assess for
 interval change.
 
 No comparison studies at this institution.  Please note that comparison to old
 films can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina.  There is a
 nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  There are patchy opacities in both upper lobes, left greater than
 right as well as in the right mid medial lung and at both lung bases.  These
 findings could represent aspiration or pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema
 given the unusual distribution of the findings.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  The heart is normal in size.  There is some fullness to the right
 paratracheal soft tissues and hilar soft tissues which could be related to
 vascular congestion and the more consolidative process within the lungs. 
 These can be better assessed on followup imaging or by comparison to remote
 studies.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.
