                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Relative opacity at the medial right lung base is felt to more
 likely be due to vascular structures rather than consolidation.  The left lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Medial right base opacity felt to more likely be due to
 vascular structures rather than consolidation.
