                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Nausea, vomiting, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Prominence of interstitial markings bilaterally appears similar
 compared to the prior exam and is likely chronic. No overt pulmonary edema is
 present. There is minimal atelectasis in the lung bases but no focal
 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine with anterior bridging
 osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis. Prominent interstitial markings bilaterally appear to
 be similar to the prior studies, suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung
 disease.
