                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact midline sternal wires
 following CABG procedure.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary markings could
 reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though this also could be
 a manifestation of chronic pulmonary disease.  Probable mild atelectatic
 changes at the bases without definite pleural effusion.
