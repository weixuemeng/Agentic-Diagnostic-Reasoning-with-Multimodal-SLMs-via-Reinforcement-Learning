                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and low-grade fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a
 patient with intact midline sternal wires following CABG procedure.  Mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists.  The opacification at the
 left base is persistent, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis.  On the right, the costophrenic angle is more sharply seen,
 suggesting decrease in pleural fluid with some mild residual atelectasis.
