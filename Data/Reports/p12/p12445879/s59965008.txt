 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with end-stage renal disease with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis.  Additionally, the cardiac silhouette appears significantly
 enlarged in comparison to the prior study. Otherwise, the remainder of the
 lungs are clear.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Significant enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in comparison to the
 prior study. Although this may be positional in nature, a pericardial effusion
 cannot be excluded. 
 
 2. New small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
