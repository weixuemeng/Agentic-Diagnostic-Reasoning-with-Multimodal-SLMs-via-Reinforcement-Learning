                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are hazy perihilar opacities,
 increasing cardiomegaly, interstitial septal thickening, and new small
 bilateral pleural effusions, all findings which support new moderate pulmonary
 edema.  More confluent consolidation in the right infrahilar region may be
 secondary to asymmetric edema, though pneumonia/aspiration are within the
 differential.  Recommend follow-up radiographs after diuresis for further
 assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate pulmonary edema
