                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma, now with new right upper quadrant pain and
 anterior chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as
 well as CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right central catheter with
 the tip in the mid SVC.  The heart is top normal in size and the lung volumes
 are low.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are better evaluated on recent CT chest. 
 Fullness of mediastinal and upper lobe pulmonary vessels may be secondary to
 change in patient position and a more lordotic view.  There is no large
 pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Fullness of mediastinal and upper lobe pulmonary vessels are likely secondary
 to change in patient position and a more lordotic view.  Otherwise unchanged
 chest radiograph.
