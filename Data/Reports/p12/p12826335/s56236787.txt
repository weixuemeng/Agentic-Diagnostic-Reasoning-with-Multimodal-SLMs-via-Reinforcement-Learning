                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w UC and complicated diverticulitis, OR case cancelled today
 because of de-sat'ing, purulent sputum  // ? eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely increased reticular interstitial markings likely reflect chronic
 underlying interstitial lung disease. Widespread atypical pneumonia or early
 pulmonary edema are possible, but much less likely. Chest CT is recommended
 for further evaluation. Increased opacification of the right lung base with
 indistinct vascular margins may reflect an early right lower lobe
 consolidation. The heart size is top normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse interstitial prominence likely reflects underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease, which is better evaluated by chest CT.
 2. Increased opacification at the right base may represent an early
 consolidation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. 
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 3:56 PM, 15 minutes after the
 discovery of the findings.
