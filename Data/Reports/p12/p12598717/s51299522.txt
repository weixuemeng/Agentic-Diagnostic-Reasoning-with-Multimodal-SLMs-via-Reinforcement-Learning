                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with rib fractures, assess effusion and
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 probably unchanged.  Left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis has markedly
 improved.  The right lung is clear.  There are no new lung abnormalities or
 evident pneumothorax.  Several left lower posterior rib fractures are
 difficult to evaluate.
