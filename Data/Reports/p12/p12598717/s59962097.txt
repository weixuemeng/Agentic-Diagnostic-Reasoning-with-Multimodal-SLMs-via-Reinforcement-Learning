                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for progression in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Trace left
 pneumothorax is not seen on the current study.  Vague increased density along
 the left lower lung likely correlates to previously seen hemothorax, although
 lung contusion is possible.  New left retrocardiac opacity not seen on the
 prior CT is present.  Known rib fractures are better assessed on the recent
 chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No left pneumothorax. 
 2. New left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent atelectasis, aspiration,
 or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
