                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC remains in place, terminating in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  No new areas of
 consolidation are identified within the lungs to suggest the presence of an
 acute pneumonia.  Small amount of fluid is present in the right minor fissure
 and there may be small effusions dependently in both costophrenic sulci on the
 lateral view as well.  Additionally, an area of increased opacity overlies the
 mid thoracic spine on the lateral view and is related to known mass at the T7
 level associated with osseous destruction.  Note is also made of marked
 enlargement of main pulmonary artery, also more fully assessed by prior CT
 scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Destructive paraspinal mass in the mid thoracic spine, more fully
 evaluated by previous cross-sectional imaging studies.
