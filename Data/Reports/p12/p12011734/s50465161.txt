 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with multiple myeloma and cervical effusion and
 respiratory failure.
 
 Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.  The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged,
 consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Right PICC tip is in the
 lower SVC.  The lungs are grossly clear aside from minimal atelectasis in the
 right lower lobe, unchanged from prior.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  A spinal fusion hardware in the cervical spine is partially imaged.
