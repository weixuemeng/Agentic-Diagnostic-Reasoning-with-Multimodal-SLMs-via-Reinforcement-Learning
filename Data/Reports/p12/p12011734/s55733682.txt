                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple myeloma being worked up for auto
 BMT transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CT chest from ___ and chest
 radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 likely due to poor inspiration.  Low lung volumes are seen to result in some
 bronchovascular crowding.  A small left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  The right hemidiaphragm appears less elevated than on previous
 imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion, otherwise unremarkable chest
 radiograph.
