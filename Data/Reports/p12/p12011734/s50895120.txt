                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma, emergency three corpectomy and fusion, hypoxemic
 respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Lordotic positioning.  A right subclavian
 PICC line is present.  The tip is not optimally demonstrated, but appears to
 lie in the region of the cavoatrial junction, possibly slightly beyond it.  No
 CHF.  There is some patchy opacity in the retrocardiac and right cardiophrenic
 regions, consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation.  At the periphery
 of these images, screws are seen in the lower cervical spine.  The known left
 posteromedial chest wall mass likely accounts for some opacity in the region
 of the AP window and along the posterior chest well, but is not well
 delineated on this film.
