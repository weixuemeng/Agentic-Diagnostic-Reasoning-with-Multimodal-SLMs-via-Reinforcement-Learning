 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturations, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, potentially as a result of a lesser inspiratory effort.  Minimal
 fluid overload and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or other pathological parenchymal opacity.  No pneumothorax.  Right
 subclavian line is unchanged.
