                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  History of coronary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is moderately tortuous. The arch
 shows patchy calcification.  Otherwise, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  The humeral head appears sclerotic, probably due to
 degenerative disease of the shoulder, which is incompletely imaged. All
 visualized thoracic interspaces appear mildly narrowed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
