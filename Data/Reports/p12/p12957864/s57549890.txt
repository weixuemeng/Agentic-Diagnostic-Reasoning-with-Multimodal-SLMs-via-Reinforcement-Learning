                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pressure in a patient with non-ST elevation MI.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No interval development of pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Hyperinflation is noted as well as most likely present small
 amount of pleural effusion.  Relative lucency at the left apex is noted and
 might reflect emphysema, but no evidence of pneumothorax is present.
