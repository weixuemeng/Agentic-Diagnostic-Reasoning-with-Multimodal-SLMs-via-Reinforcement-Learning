                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated  // confirm tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of
 the film. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 seen in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Both hila are slightly
 enlarged, which can be seen with pulmonary hypertension. Emphysema is noted.
 Scarring within the lung apices is present, with bullous disease in the right
 apex. Patchy opacities within the lung bases, more so on the left, may reflect
 atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly noted on this supine exam, though the left
 costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis though aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.
 3. Scarring within the lung apices with bullous formation in the right apex.
