 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is nearly 7 cm from the carina an should be advanced 15
 mm for more secure seating. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a
 nondistended stomach. Heart is top-normal size. There is no evidence of
 cardiac decompensation.  A cluster of cystic spaces in a severely retracted
 right lung apex is presumably the residual of tuberculosis.  Comparison with
 recent prior radiographs would be necessary to confirm that the area is inert.
