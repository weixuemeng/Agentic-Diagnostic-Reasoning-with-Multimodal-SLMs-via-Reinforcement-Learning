                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:   The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart appears borderline enlarged.  There is volume loss in the left lung
 with smooth thickening of the left apical pleura suggesting scarring and
 potentially post-surgical change.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary interstitium is mildly prominent, suggesting mild
 vascular congestion, including perihilar fullness.  The frontal view also
 suggests a medial retrocardiac opacity.  The bones appear markedly
 demineralized.  A lower thoracic vertebral body shows a vertebra plana
 deformity which is of uncertain chronicity, although not necessarily acute. 
 In addition, a second vertebral body, probably relating to the upper lumbar
 spine, shows a poorly visualized suspected compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Smooth but marked left apical pleural thickening, suspected to be chronic
 and possibly due to prior inflammation or possibly post-surgical.  Direct
 comparison to prior studies may be helpful to assess for change if any are
 available.
 
 2.  Patchy suspected retrocardiac opacity.  Possibilities include atelectasis
 or scarring.  Pneumonia is not excluded.  Follow-up radiographs may be helpful
 to re-assess in addition to correlation with pulmonary symptoms, if any.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload. 
 
 4.  Severe lower thoracic compression deformity and probably a second
 compression deformity along the upper lumbar spine.
