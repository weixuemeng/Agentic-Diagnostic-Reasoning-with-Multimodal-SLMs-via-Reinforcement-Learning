                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Questionable retrocardiac opacity.  
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  There are bibasal opacities, and
 there is also interval additional increase in interstitial opacities, findings
 concerning for interstitial pulmonary edema.  Infectious process in the lung
 bases especially is another possibility, and right hilar fullness potentially
 can reflect a consolidation and lymphadenopathy.  No discrete nodular opacity
 to suggest neoplasm currently demonstrated, and further followup of the
 patient after diuresis and then after antibiotic therapy is required.
