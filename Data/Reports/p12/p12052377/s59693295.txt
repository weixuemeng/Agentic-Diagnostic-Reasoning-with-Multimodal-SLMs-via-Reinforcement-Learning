                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath in a patient with known
 ST-elevation MI treated for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Current study demonstrates normal heart size and mediastinum.  The patient is
 after median sternotomy due to CABG.  There is still presence of mild
 pulmonary edema noted, in particular in the lower lungs.  In the lower lungs
 it also can be due a contributing atelectasis or infection (correlate
 clinically).  To assess dynamic changes, comparison with prior imaging would
 be beneficial.
