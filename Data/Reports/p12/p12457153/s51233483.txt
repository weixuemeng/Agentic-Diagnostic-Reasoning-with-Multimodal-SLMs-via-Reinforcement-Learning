                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new Dobbhoff tube placement,
 confirm correct position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  The Dobbhoff line has been placed and reaches barely
 into the area of the hiatus.  The tip is pointing towards the fundus of the
 stomach.  Further advancement, however, is recommended.
 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, a remarkable progression of the aortic contour widening in the arch
 area and proximal descending portion is noted.  This finding may be
 exaggerated by the significant tilt of the patient towards the right, but in
 order to exclude significant drop widening of the thoracic aorta, a repeat
 study should be obtained.  Referring physician, ___, was paged to
 explore if patient shows clinical symptoms that can be related to the changes
 of the aorta.
