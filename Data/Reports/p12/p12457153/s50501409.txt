                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are
 clear.  There is hyperinflation of the lungs evidenced by increased anterior
 clear space and flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Increased prominence of interstitial markings
 likely represents chronic lung disease.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is
 bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Increased prominence of interstitial markings likely represents chronic
 lung disease.  Hyperinflation suggests COPD.
