                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, poor historian, not acting like herself,
 possibly falling at home.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal limits.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures but
 no pulmonary edema is present.  Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are
 unremarkable.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis
 but infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  Degenerative changes are seen within the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
