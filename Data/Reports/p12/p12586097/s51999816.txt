                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recent pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Tortuous aorta is noted.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for left lower lobe where focal opacity is noted within the
 absence of prior studies, dynamic changes cannot be assessed.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 chronicity undetermined.
 
 If comparison to prior studies become available, addendum will be gladly
 added.
