                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left IJ central venous line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left IJ central venous catheter which terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Lung volumes are low.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes likely relates to low lung volumes and AP technique.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  Mild prominence of the interstitium diffusely likely relates to
 crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  It is difficult to exclude trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left IJ center venous catheter terminating at the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes.
