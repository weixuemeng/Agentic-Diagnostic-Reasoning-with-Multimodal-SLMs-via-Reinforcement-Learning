                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, cp  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged, but unchanged compared to the prior, with a
 tortuous course of the thoracic aorta.  Linear opacities in the right midlung
 likely represent focal scarring, also unchanged.  The lungs are hyperinflated,
 with no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or focal airspace
 opacity.  Surgical clips projecting over the lower anterior mediastinum are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation and chronic right midlung scarring. Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary pathology.
