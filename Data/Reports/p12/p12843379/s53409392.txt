                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMH significant for COPD presenting to the FICU for
 undifferentiated shock and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with evidence of
 pnuemonia, basal ganglia stroke, ATN requiring CRRT, demand ischemia, with
 shock liver and rhabdomyalysis now with low grade fevers.  // evidence of
 infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___ chest radiograph, the cardiac silhouette is slightly
 larger, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and lower lung
 interstitial opacities.  These findings are most likely due to interstitial
 edema, but atypical pneumonia could produce a similar appearance of the lung
 parenchyma particularly in this patient with underlying emphysema.
