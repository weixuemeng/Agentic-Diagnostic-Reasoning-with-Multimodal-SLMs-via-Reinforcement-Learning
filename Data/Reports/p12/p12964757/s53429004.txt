                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study there has been interval partial clearing of the
 diffuse alveolar infiltrates, though patchy areas of alveolar infiltrates are
 still present.  There is still ill-defined vasculature with pulmonary vascular
 redistribution.  There is a small left effusion.  Findings are compatible with
 improved but persistent CHF.
