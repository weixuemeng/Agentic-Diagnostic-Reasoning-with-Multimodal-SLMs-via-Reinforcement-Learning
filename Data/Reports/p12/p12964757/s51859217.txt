 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, potential pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows no
 interval development of pneumonia.  A small left-sided pleural effusion,
 better seen on the lateral than on the frontal view, is unchanged.  Equally
 unchanged are signs of mild fluid overload.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No lung nodules or masses.
