                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.
 
 When compared to prior, there has been near complete interval resolution of
 the patchy opacities projecting over the right upper lung as well as the left
 upper lung.  There is, however, new patchy opacity at the left lung base with
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall improvement of the bilateral opacities identified on
 prior.  However, there has been progression of disease at the left lung base
 suggesting possible new pneumonia and small effusion.  Two-view chest x-ray
 may help further characterize.
