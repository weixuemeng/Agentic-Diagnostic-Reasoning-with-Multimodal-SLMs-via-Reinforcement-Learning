 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post mechanical fall, rib fracture, status post

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a right chest tube.  The extent of the pleural effusion is unchanged.  The
 extent of soft tissue air collection in the right chest wall cannot be
 assessed given that the chest wall is not included in the image.
 
 There is no evidence of a right pneumothorax.  The left lung and the cardiac
 silhouette appear unchanged.
