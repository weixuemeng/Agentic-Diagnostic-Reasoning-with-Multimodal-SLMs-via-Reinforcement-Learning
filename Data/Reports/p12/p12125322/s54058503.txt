 in opacification at the right base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Less
 prominent changes are seen on the left.  The findings are consistent with a
 development of layering pleural effusions with underlying compressive
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right IJ catheter is been
 removed.  The right Port-A-Cath through the subclavian approach remains in
 place.
