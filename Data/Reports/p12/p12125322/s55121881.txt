                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stage 4 colangiocarcinoma s/p resection,
 spiking fevers  // assess for new conslidation; also being infused with
 multiple blood products- eval for TACO
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is in-situ.  A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath is unchanged
 in position, the tip is in the mid SVC.  A left-sided internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is incompletely
 visualized but terminates below the diaphragm.  A right-sided pleural drain is
 unchanged in position.  A right upper quadrant pain is also unchanged.
 
 There has been interval development of very extensive bilateral airspace
 opacities.  This involves nearly all the lung but has some peripheral sparing.
 The appearances are most consistent with acute pulmonary edema, particular
 given the rapid interval progression.  Infection is considered less likely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New extensive bilateral and relatively symmetric airspace opacities most
 consistent with acute pulmonary edema.  Infection is considered less likely.
