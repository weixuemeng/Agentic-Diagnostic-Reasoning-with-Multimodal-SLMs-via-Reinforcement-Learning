 The lung volumes are low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures.
 Opacity in the, left greater than right, lung bases most likely represents
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contour is normal. Clips
 are noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the, left greater than right, lung bases most likely represents
 atelectasis, however, in the appropriate setting could represent pneumonia.
