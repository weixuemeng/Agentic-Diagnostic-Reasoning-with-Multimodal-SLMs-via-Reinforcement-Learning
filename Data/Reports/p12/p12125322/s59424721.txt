                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dobhoff migration  // evaluate for dobhoff
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior
 study.  A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath is in-situ, the tip terminates in
 the mid SVC.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal
 SVC.  A nasogastric tube is in-situ which terminates in the stomach.  A
 Dobhoff tube is in-situ which appears to terminate close to the duodenum
 jejunal junction.  A pigtail catheter is seen projecting over the right lung
 base.  An additional catheter seen in projecting over the right hemidiaphragm,
 this is likely a perihepatic drain.
 
 There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.  Air bronchograms are noted
 in the retrocardiac space.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
 similar in appearance compared to the prior study and consistent with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
