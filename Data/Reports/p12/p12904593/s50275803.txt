                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left internal jugular central venous line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest obtained at an
 outside hospital (___) from four hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a left
 internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the upper SVC.  A
 right dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter is unchanged, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace opacity.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left internal jugular central venous line and right hemodialysis
 port in appropriate position, as described above.  No evidence of
 complication.  Mild cardiomegaly.
