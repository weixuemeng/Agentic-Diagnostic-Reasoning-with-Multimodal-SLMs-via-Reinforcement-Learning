 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:24 PM
  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and minimally increased pulmonary
  vascular prominence. Low lung volumes without consolidation in the aerated
  upper lungs, but infection in the lower lungs cannot be excluded in the
  setting of low lung volumes and bibasilar opacification. Interval extubation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the ET tube is no longer visualized.  The NG tube
 remains present, beneath the diaphragm, with tip overlying fundus.  A
 right-sided dual-lumen line is present.  The tip is not optimally visualized
 due to underpenetration -- the apparent difference in positioning is likely
 accounted for by lordotic positioning on the current film.  A left IJ central
 line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, grossly unchanged.  Splaying of the carina is consistent with left
 atrial enlargement.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF, similar to prior.  There is bibasilar collapse
 and/or consolidation, with small bilateral effusions, also similar to prior.
 
 Again seen is a 1.4 x 3.2 cm ovoid density adjacent to the trachea on the
 left, near the left medial clavicular head.  Slight narrowing of the trachea
 may be present in this area.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the ET tube.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
 
 2.  Ovoid density adjacent to the trachea on the left, with ? slight narrowing
 of the trachea in this area,  not fully characterized.  ? large calcified
 mediastinal  node or calcified thyroid nodule.
