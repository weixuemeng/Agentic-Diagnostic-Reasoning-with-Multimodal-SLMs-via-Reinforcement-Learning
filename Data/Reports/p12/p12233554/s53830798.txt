                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen. There is eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 The right costophrenic angle is blunted on the frontal view; however, not well
 substantiated on the lateral view and trace pleural effusion is not excluded,
 it is felt unlikely.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is
 calcified.  The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  A retrocardiac
 air-fluid level seen on the lateral view is most consistent with hiatal
 hernia.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 may relate to the eventration, though very trace right pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
