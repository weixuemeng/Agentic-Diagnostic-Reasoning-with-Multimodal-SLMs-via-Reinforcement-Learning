                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and WBC.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm is redemonstrated.  Again there is some blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus, possibly reflecting small pleural effusion.  The heart is
 not enlarged.  There is worsening perihilar opacity likely in the posterior
 segment of the right upper lobe which may reflect pneumonia.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A hiatal hernia is redemonstrated, with air-fluid
 level in the left lower hemithorax.  Again there are notable degenerative
 changes in the lumbar spine with retrolisthesis of a lower thoracic level,
 unchanged since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening right perihilar opacity may reflect pneumonia. 
 Followup chest radiograph is necessary to demonstrate resolution and CT of the
 chest if finding persists.
 
 These results were telephoned by ___ to ___ at 11:55 a.m.,
 ___, five minutes after discovery.
