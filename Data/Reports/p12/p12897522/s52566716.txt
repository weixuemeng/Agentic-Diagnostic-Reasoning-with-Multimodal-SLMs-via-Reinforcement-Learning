                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension  // eval LIJ CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:08 at outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen, terminating in the
 proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  Patchy left basilar opacity is
 more conspicuous as compared to the prior study which may be due to overlap of
 vascular structures although underlying aspiration or developing infection are
 not excluded.  Cavitary structure previously seen in the right mid to lower
 lung is more conspicuous on prior studies including that earlier today.  No
 pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
