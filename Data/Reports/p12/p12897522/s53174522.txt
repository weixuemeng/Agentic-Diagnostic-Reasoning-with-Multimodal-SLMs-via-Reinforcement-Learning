                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___ and ___ as well as
 chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple thin-walled cysts are present within the right middle and
 right lower lobes, including a dominant posteriorly located cyst which
 contains a small dependent air-fluid level.  As compared to the chest x-ray of
 ___, the walls of the cysts appear thinner, and an area of
 adjacent consolidation within the right lower lobe is no longer apparent. 
 Minimal linear areas of scar or atelectasis are present adjacent to this cyst
 on the current exam.  Remainder of lungs are clear, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple thin-walled cysts, predominantly in the right lower
 lobe, likely due to post-infectious pneumatocele as suggested on prior CT
 imaging. Congenital cystic lesions complicated by recent infection are less
 likely.
