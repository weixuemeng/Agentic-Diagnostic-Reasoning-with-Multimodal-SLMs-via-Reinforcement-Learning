                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with sarcoid and weight loss.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 There is a very limited change in the radiographic appearance of the lungs
 since ___.  A triangular region of radiopacity in the right upper
 lung at the level of the third anterior interspace, may on the lateral view be
 localized to the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  Unfortunately, I
 cannot see lesion clearly enough to suggest a specific diagnosis, but could be
 infectious, either acute or more protracted.  I would obtain oblique views to
 establish a baseline appearance, and then after empiric treatment, repeat and
 see if the area has cleared.  It may ultimately be necessary to do chest CT
 scanning and compared with ___.
 
 Smaller irregular nodules primarily in the upper lungs are unchanged.  There
 is no substantial central lymph node enlargement or any pleural abnormality
 and the heart is normal size.
