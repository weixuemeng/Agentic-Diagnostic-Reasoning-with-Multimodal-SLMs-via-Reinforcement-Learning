                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hematemesis or hemoptysis.  Evaluate for
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable AP radiograph of the chest is provided.  The radiograph was
 repeated due to positioning of the patient's left hand over the lower chest.
 
 The patient is rotated.  There is a tracheostomy tube within the midtrachea. 
 The cuff is inflated such that it distends the trachea.  The lungs are clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Of note, in the first view, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated
 raised, and on the subsequent radiograph it has descended.  There has been no
 motion of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is a left internal jugular central
 venous line terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 2. Findings suggestive of right hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.  Alternatively
 this appearance could be caused by an abdominal process such as hepatic
 enlargement.
