                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There is a
 right-sided PICC, terminating in the proximal SVC, without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis and skinfold; however,
 a trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.
