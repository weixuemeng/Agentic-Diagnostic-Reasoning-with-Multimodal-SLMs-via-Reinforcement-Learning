                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation or pleural effusion currently pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is
 questionable mild prominence of the left hilum on the frontal view, which may
 be artifactual, but underlying lymphadenopathy is not entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidation.  Equivocal mild prominence of the left hilum on the
 frontal view may be artifactual but underlying lymphadenopathy is not
 excluded.  This could be further evaluated with a nonurgent chest CT.
