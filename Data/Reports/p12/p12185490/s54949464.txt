                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dementia, PMR, on prednisone, presented
 with abd pain and WBC 19K, now sedated with tachypnea, hypoxia, and new b/l
 rales  // r/o pulmonary edema, infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The examination is limited by marked patient rotation and low lung volumes. 
 The questionable area peripheral consolidation in the right upper lobe remains
 none resolved on this limited study, and standard PA and lateral views of the
 chest would be helpful for more complete assessment of this region when the
 patient's condition permits.  Please see recent chest radiograph report from
 earlier the same date for a complete description of cardiothoracic findings.
