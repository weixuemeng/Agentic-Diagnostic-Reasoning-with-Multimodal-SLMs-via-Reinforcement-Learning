                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for an acute process in a patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates moderately aerated lungs with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 This may be in part due to technique as well as low lung volumes.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Density
 overlying the right upper zone laterally may be accounted for by confluence of
 the scapula and ribs.  Numerous right-sided healed rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  If clinically indicated, oblique
 views may help to further assess the faint density in the lateral aspect of
 the right upper lobe -- please see comment above.
