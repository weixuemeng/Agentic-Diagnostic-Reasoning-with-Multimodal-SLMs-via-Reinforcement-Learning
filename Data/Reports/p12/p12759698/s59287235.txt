 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever while on chemotherapy, patient with history of
 metastatic renal cell cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  A suture is again noted in the left upper lung, compatible with
 site of prior partial lung resection.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There
 is no sign of pneumonia, CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is evidence of prior left sixth
 partial rib resection.  Otherwise, the bony structures appear intact.
