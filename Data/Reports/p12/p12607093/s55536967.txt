                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:
 None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The chin overlies the upper most portion of the chest.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  No CHF, focal consolidation, or
 effusion is detected. An area of focal opacity at in the lung base
 posteriorly, seen on the lateral view, likely represents an artifact due to
 overlap of vascular and osseous shadows.  Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 There is suggestion of right convex curvature centered in the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt acute pulmonary process.
