 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is mild residual pulmonary vascular congestion,

 venous lines are no longer visualized.  There is no confluent consolidation. 
 Please note, lateral view is limited secondary to patient's arms being down by
 his side.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in configuration.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Posterior cervical and thoracic
 fixation hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in previously seen pulmonary vascular congestion
 without other superimposed cardiovascular process.
