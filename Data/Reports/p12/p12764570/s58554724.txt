 Moderate right pneumothorax has increased predominantly at the base of the
 right lung, anterior component visible on the lateral view as well.  Course of
 the right pleural tube suggests it is in the major fissure.  This could
 explain suboptimal functioning of the drainage tube.  Cardiomediastinal
