                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removed.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, one of the chest tubes has
 been removed and there is no definite pneumothorax.  On this study, what
 appears to be a cavitary process with air-fluid level is better appreciated in
 the apex.  The more caudal opacification and extensive opacification along the
 lateral chest wall are again seen.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
