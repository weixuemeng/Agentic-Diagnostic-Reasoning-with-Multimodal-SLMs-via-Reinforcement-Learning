                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pneumothorax, drains in place.  Evaluate
 drains, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, a small
 right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged in size.  Right-sided chest
 tubes remain in unchanged position.  Increased opacity at the right lung base
 is likely related to a small pleural effusion. There is redemonstration of a
 stable right upper lung opacity.  The left lung is clear. A right PICC line
 terminates in the distal SVC. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
