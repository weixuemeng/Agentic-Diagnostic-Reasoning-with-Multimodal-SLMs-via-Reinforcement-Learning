                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post resection of infected and
 ruptured lung cyst (pneumatocele).  Also pulmonary total decortication. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged
 and is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present.  The previously described right-sided pleural
 thickenings that include a blunting of the right lateral sinus, varying degree
 of thickening along the right lateral wall and a linear density overlying the
 right upper lobe in which the resection was performed appear rather unchanged.
 It is noted, however, that there exists a loculated small pneumothorax in the
 right apical area mostly located anteriorly with a small air-fluid level which
 was not present on the previous examination.  As this development was rather
 surprising, efforts were made to reach the referring physician ___
 ___.  Information was given at 3:35 p.m. that the patient had been
 discharged to home with a drainage tube in the apical area in place.  The tube
 was later removed.  This finding explains presence of a small loculated
 pneumothorax with air-fluid level in this area.  I recommend followup
 examination in another two weeks to see its resolution.
