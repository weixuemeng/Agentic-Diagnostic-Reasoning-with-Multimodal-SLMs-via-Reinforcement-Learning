                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS decortication.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued right
 apical pneumothorax that appears to be somewhat larger than on the previous
 study.  This raises the question of whether the chest tube has been clamped.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
