 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, a small
 right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged.  Right-sided chest tubes
 remain in unchanged position.  There has been interval improvement of a
 right-sided pleural effusion.  There is persistent opacification of the right
 upper lobe consistent with a consolidation.  Opacity along the right lateral
 chest wall is likely post-surgical in nature. The left lung is clear. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
