                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place, with a persistent moderate right
 apical pneumothorax, with visceral apical pleural line at level of the right
 third posterior rib.  Heterogeneous opacities in right mid and lower lung have
 slightly worsened in the interval, and are probably due to atelectasis.  A
 peripheral right upper lobe opacity corresponding to a site of a known
 cavitary lesion on recent CT appears slightly smaller.  Left lung and pleural
 surfaces are clear.
