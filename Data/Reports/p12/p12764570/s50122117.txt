                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post right upper lobe wedge resection and
 decortication.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___.  CT chest
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates three right-sided chest tubes.
 Small right pneumothorax is noted, which has decreased in size since prior. 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of pleural
 effusion.  Right upper lung consolidation is new since prior.  Left lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The heart size is normal. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right pneumothorax following right upper lobe wedge resection, decreased
 in size since prior.  Right upper lung consolidation is new since priors and
 may reflect post-surgical changes.
