                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right upper lobe wedge resection,
 decortication.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tubes appear in unchanged position.  Small right
 pneumothorax is unchanged.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggestive of pleural effusion.    Again seen is a right upper lung
 consolidation. There is atelectasis at the left lung base. Left lung is
 otherwise essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged small right pneumothorax.  Persistent right upper lobe
 consolidation may be related to post surgical changes.
