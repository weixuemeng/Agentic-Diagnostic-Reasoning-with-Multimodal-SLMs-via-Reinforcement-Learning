                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:52 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a pneumothorax after chest tube placed on
 ___:
 
 The right lower pleural tube has been re-positioned slightly.  Moderate right
 apical pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall are
 stable.  Right pleural thickening suggests recent pleurodesis.  Left lung
 clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Previous saccular bronchiectasis
 in the right upper lung may have improved, suggesting an acute component,
 unless of course the patient has had interval surgery.
