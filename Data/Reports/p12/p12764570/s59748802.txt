                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient status post VATS resection of a pneumatocele status post
 chest tube removal with a residual loculated small right apical pneumothorax,
 eval pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The previously described right apical loculated pneumothorax has cleared.  The
 post-operative changes in the right lung, which include a locuated right
 lateral chest wall fluid collection and pleural thickening, blunting of the
 right costophrenic sulcus and the linear density in the right upper lobe are
 all unchanged.  The left lung is well expanded and clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resolution of the right apical loculated pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Unchanged right lateral pleural thickening, loculated fluid collection,
 and blunting of the costophrenic sulcus.
