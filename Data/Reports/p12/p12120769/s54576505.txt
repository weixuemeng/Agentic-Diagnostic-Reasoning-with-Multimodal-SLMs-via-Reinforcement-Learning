                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of suspected consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Right lower lobe
 opacity is linear, unchanged or even slightly improved since the prior study,
 most likely representing atelectasis.  Similar lingular atelectasis is noted. 
 Both abnormalities are unlikely to reflect infectious process.  The upper
 lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
