 There are large bands of atelectasis at both lung bases and on the right a
 wedge-shaped region of consolidation which could be either more atelectasis or
 an early pneumonia.  There is no evidence of pneumonia elsewhere in the lungs.
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  Heart size is normal, exaggerated by low
 lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.
