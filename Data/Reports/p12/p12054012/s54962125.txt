                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-op chest x-ray, NSTEMI, for CABG.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. 
 The aorta is unfolded.  There is possible minimal upper zone re-distribution,
 but no other evidence of CHF.  No focal infiltrate or effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected. Increased opacity adjacent to the left cardiac
 apex/left costophrenic angle most likely is related to a cardiac fat pad
 and/or overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
