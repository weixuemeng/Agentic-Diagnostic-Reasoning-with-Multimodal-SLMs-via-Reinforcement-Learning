                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___, chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope and unresponsiveness,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Lung volumes
 are somewhat low.  A retrocardiac opacity is noted which likely reflects
 patient's known hiatal hernia.  No large consolidation or supine evidence for
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is unchanged, and the
 mediastinal contour is stable with an unfolded thoracic aorta noted.  There is
 calcification of the tracheobronchial tree again noted.  Severe degenerative
 disease is noted at both shoulders.  Degenerative changes of the spine is also
 noted.  Gas-filled loops of bowel are noted in the left mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Severe degenerative
 disease at the shoulders.  Gas distention of small bowel loops in the upper
 abdomen.  Recommend correlation with abdominal radiograph or CT if there is
 associated abdominal pain.
