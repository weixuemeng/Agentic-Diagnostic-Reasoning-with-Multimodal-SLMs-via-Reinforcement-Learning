 eval interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest on ___ at 06:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube has
 its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carinal. A right basilar chest tube
 remains in place.  The heart remains enlarged. There is a layering left
 effusion. On the right, there are several rib fractures identified, although
 these were better seen on prior chest CT.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.
 There is air within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues consistent with
 subcutaneous emphysema.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the
 right mid and lower lung likely reflects atelectasis, although a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
