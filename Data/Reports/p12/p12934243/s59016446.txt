                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of feeding tube with tip terminating below the
 diaphragm outside of the field of view.  Stable cardiomediastinal contours
 when allowances are made for lower lung volumes on the current study. 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion appears slightly larger, and combined
 right-sided loculated pleural fluid and pleural thickening appear similar. 
 Asymmetrical perihilar opacities have worsened on the left and could reflect
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema or aspiration.  Persistent left lower lobe
 atelectasis and/or consolidation adjacent to the above-described pleural
 effusion.
