                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 mild calcification of the aortic knob.  Linear opacity seen in the left upper
 lung field, right lung base and lingula likely represents atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
