                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP Chest Radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with organizing pneumonia here w/ pneumothorax.
 Evaluate chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated ___ to ___.  CT
 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed pigtail catheter projects over the right lateral hemithorax
 with apparent improvement in the right pneumothorax, now not readily
 appreciable.  Lung volumes are low. Bilateral diffuse patchy opacities, more
 prominent on the right, are more conspicuous and increased in number and size
 from at least ___, but somewhat similar dated ___.  Day-to-day changes
 likely reflect edema, but persistent opacities likely reflect underlying
 infection and scarring, better seen on CT. No definite pleural effusion.  The
 heart is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Newly placed right pigtail projects over right lateral hemithorax with
 resolution of right pneumothorax.
 2. Progressive bilateral extensive consolidations, likely combination of
 edema, severe scaring, and pneumonia.
