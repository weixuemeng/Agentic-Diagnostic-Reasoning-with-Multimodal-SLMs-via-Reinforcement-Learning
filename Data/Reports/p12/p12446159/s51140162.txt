 wires, valvular prosthesis, coronary vascular stent and surgical clips are
 noted.  Curvilinear density on the lateral view in the anterior chest is of
 uncertain identity, likely postsurgical in nature.  The heart is normal in
 size with tortuous aorta with a prominent aortic knob.

 thoracic aorta.
