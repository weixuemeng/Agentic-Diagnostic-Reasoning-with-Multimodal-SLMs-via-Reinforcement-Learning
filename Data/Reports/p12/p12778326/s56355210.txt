 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is a moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with
 superior fissural and subpleural component which could suggest loculation with
 associated right base consolidation.  The left lung is essentially clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with possible partial
 loculation with adjacent right base consolidation which could be compressive
 atelectasis however this may represent infection given the correct clinical
 circumstance.
