                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of bronchiectasis and atrial flutter
 presents with shortness of breath and atrial flutter
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal and unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 similar.  Superior retraction of the hila with architectural distortion,
 volume loss and coarse interstitial opacities with bronchiectasis and scarring
 in the upper lobes appear grossly unchanged.  Additional coarse interstitial
 opacities are noted within both mid and lower lung fields with ring shadows,
 likely reflective of airway wall thickening, bronchiectasis and small airways
 disease.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is compatible with
 small pleural effusions.  There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Chronic changes within the upper lobes bilaterally suggestive of prior
 granulomatous disease.
 2.  Coarse interstitial opacities within the remainder of the lungs
 bilaterally, slightly worse in the interval, with airway wall thickening and
 bronchiectasis likely reflects acute on chronic airways infection and
 inflammation, perhaps related to atypical mycobacterial infection.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
