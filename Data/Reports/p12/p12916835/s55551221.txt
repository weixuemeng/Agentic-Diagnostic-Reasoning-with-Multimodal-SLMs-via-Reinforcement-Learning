                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Vascular
 deficiency in the upper lungs could be due to emphysema, even though lungs are
 not clearly hyperinflated. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 Heart size is normal.  Cervical fusion hardware is partially imaged.  Mild
 anterior wedge deformities of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies appear
 longstanding.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Possible emphysema.
