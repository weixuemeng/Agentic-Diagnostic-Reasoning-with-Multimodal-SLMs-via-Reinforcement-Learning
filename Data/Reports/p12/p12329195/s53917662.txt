                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, dyspnea, myalgias, and URI
 symptoms, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The
 bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Subtle hazy opacification of the bilateral
 lower lungs likely relates to a combination of crowding of bronchovascular
 structures in the setting of a suboptimal inspiratory effort and attenuation
 from overlying soft tissue, and is unchanged in appearance compared to a chest
 radiograph from ___.  There is no focal lung consolidation, and the
 upper lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No significant interval change when
 compared to the prior study.
