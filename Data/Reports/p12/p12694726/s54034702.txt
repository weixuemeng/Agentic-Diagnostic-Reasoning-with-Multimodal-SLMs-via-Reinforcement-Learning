                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Reported hypotension and nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and transcatheter aortic valve
 replacement.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with diffuse
 calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Mediastinal contour is
 stable with clips again demonstrated in the lower aspect of the neck likely
 related to prior thyroid surgery.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are re-
 demonstrated which limit assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma. 
 There are likely streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, reflective of
 atelectasis.  Small amount of right basal lateral pleural thickening versus
 fluid is noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques compatible with prior asbestos exposure. 
 These plaques limit assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma, with
 streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural effusion versus right basal
 lateral pleural thickening may be present.
