                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of pulmonary
 asbestosis and pleural plaques.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is no substantial change in the
 widespread opacities related to the calcified pleural plaques.  There is
 interval development of mild perihilar vascular indistinctness that might be
 consistent with volume overload, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
