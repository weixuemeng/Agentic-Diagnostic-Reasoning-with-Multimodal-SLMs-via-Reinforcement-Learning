                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute kidney injury and increased oxygen requirements, here to
 evaluate for evidence of CHF or chronic COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, most recently dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The overall appearance of the chest is not significantly changed
 from the most recent prior study.  Widespread dense opacities projecting over
 the lungs and along the bilateral hemidiaphragms are compatible with calcified
 pleural plaques.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is
 unchanged.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable.  A right internal
 jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A
 vascular graft compatible with a CoreValve projects over the aortic root. 
 Calcification at the aortic knob is noted.  Surgical clips along the right
 lower neck are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, which is
 unchanged from the most recent prior study.
 2.  Overall unchanged appearance of the chest with asbestos-related calcified
 pleural plaques.
