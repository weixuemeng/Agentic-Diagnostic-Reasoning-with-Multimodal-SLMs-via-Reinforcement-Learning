                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate Swan-Ganz catheter placement in a patient status post
 mitral valve replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 1 hour prior on the same
 day, as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning
 of the Swan-Ganz catheter, which now likely terminates at the proximal right
 pulmonary artery.  Sternal wires, a nasogastric tube which extends below the
 diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, ___ mediastinal drains, and
 epicardial pacing leads are all unchanged in position. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains normal.  The lungs are clear, without focal consolidation
 or large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter, with the tip overlying the
 proximal right pulmonary artery.
