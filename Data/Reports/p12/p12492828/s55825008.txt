                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post VATS, with localized left
 upper lobe wedge resection on ___.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  As before, no evidence of
 cardiac enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  The, on previous examination
 identified local density at the site of the wedge resection has now changed
 into more linear density compatible with scar formations.  No new parenchymal
 abnormalities seen.  Previously described pleural fat pad obliterating cardiac
 apex remains as before.  No new pleural abnormalities are seen and no
 pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  Previously remaining local
 chest wall emphysema has disappeared.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory findings on followup examination.  Postoperative
 scar formation but no pneumothorax.
