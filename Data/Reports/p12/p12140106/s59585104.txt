                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again visualized is a faint opacity overlying the left lower lung either
 representing scarring or atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no
 evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes remain stable in comparison to the recent study.
 However, on comparison to the prior study from ___ there is an
 increased opacity in the region of the arotopulmonary window which may
 represent lymphadenopathy, aneurysmal formation, or other etiology. There is
 also left-ward shift of the upper trachea, which appears relatively chronic.  
 No acute fractures are identified.  Left-sided port is noted with the catheter
 tip in the region of the proximal right atrium.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable in comparison to the
 recent study. However, on comparison to the prior study from ___
 there is an increased opacity in the region of the aroto-pulmonary window
 which may represent lymphadenopathy, aneurysmal formation, or other etiology.
 There is also left-ward shift of the upper trachea, which appears relatively
 chronic. A dedicated Chest CT may be obtained for further characterization.
