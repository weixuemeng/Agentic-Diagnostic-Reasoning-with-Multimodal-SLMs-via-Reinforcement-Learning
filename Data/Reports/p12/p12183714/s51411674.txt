 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment of PIC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has an
 unchanged right-sided PIC line.  Course of the line is unremarkable, the tip
 of the line projects over the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, normal chest radiograph, with the
 exception of a small atelectasis at the right lung base that is unchanged
 compared to the prior image.
