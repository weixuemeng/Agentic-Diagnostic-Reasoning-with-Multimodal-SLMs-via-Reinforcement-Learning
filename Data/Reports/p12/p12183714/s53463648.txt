                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post GSW, interval chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the
 patient in semi-upright position.
 
 The left subclavian line terminates in the lower SVC.  Again seen is a right
 PICC terminating in the axilla.  There are persistent opacities in the right
 upper lobe without evidence of volume loss.  There is new moderate left
 basilar atelectasis, which results in obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right upper lobe opacity, likely reflects atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  New moderate left lower lobe atelectasis.
