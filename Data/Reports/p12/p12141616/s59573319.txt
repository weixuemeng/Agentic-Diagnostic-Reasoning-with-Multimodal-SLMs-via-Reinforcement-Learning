 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Focal 15 mm opacity within the left apex appears new compared to the
 prior study, and could reflect progressive pulmonary parenchymal scarring. 
 Mild scarring is also noted within the right apex, similar compared to the
 prior exam.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 2.  Left apical focal opacity, new from the prior exam.  This could reflect an
 area of scarring, though further assessment with a nonemergent CT is
 recommended.
