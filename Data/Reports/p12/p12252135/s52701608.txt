                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluate for fluid overload or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  Lung volumes are low due to incomplete
 inspiration.  There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature at the bases but
 no obvious consolidation.  The upper lobes are clear.  There is bilateral
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is present.  Mediastinal widening
 is difficult to assess given low lung volumes.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Low lung volumes due to incomplete inspiration, with apparent widened
 mediastinum, possibly secondary to vascular congestion.  However a repeat
 radiograph is recommended with complete inspiration.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
 3. No evidence of pneumonia or decompensated congestive heart failure.
