                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and CT of the chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There remains mild volume loss in
 the right hemithorax with areas of pleural and parenchymal scarring.  Left
 lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of a left pleural effusion. 
 Known left apical nodular opacity on recent CT of the chest is not clearly
 visualized.  Multiple calcified pleural plaques are present bilaterally, right
 greater than left, suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously reported left apical nodular opacity on CT is not
 clearly visualized radiographically, but CT would be more sensitive than
 radiographs for evaluating this finding.
