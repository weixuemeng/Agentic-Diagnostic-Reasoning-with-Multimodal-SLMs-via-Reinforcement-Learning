                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // eval for edema, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are small pleural effusions.  Right base opacity is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Subtle left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although an additional site of consolidation is not
 excluded.  There may be mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Right base opacity is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  More subtle left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although additional consolidation is not excluded.
