                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with seven days of productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 again noted.  The aorta is calcified, as seen previously.  A nodular opacity
 projects over the anterior third rib, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
 2.  Stable nodular opacity projecting over the right anterior third rib, which
 could represent a small amount of loculated fluid or fibrotic change from
 prior pneumonia.
