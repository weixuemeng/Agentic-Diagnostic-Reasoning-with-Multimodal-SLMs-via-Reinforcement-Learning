                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST AT 10:04 P.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, question effusion or infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Atelectasis in the left lower lobe helps to explain leftward mediastinal shift
 and downward displacement of the left hilus.  Left upper lung and right lung
 are clear.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are normal.
 
 When feasible, conventional radiographs should be obtained to see if there is
 a need for CT scanning currently or followup eventually.
