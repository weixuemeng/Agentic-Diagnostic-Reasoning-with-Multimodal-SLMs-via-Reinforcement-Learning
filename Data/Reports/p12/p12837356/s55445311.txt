                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  chest CT of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube
 terminating approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Limited evaluation due to
 portable technique and the patient's body habitus.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing through the esophagus and stomach, its tip out of field of view. 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion. 
 Prominent hilar and mediastinal silhouettes, most likely relate to the
 patient's body habitus.  Bibasilar consolidations are better assessed on
 concurrent chest CT
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube terminates 2 cm above the carina, retraction by several centimeters
 is recommended for more optimal placement.
 2. Bibasilar consolidations better assessed on concurrent chest CT.
