                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with OHS, OSA, COPD, CHF, here w/ respiratory
 distress s/p diuresis.  Please eval for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.  Chest CT of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior chest radiograph, severe cardiomegaly is unchanged,
 with slightly improved pulmonary edema.  Widening of the mediastinal contour
 is due to low lung volumes and mediastinal lipomatosis is seen on the prior
 chest CT.  The right lung appears slightly better aerated.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis, infection, or aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, interval improvement in the bilateral lung
 aeration, with persistent bibasilar airspace opacities and low lung volumes.
