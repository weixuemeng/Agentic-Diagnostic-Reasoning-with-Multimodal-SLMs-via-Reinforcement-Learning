                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tactile fevers, cough, sore throat, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.  Due to large
 body habitus and low lung volumes, evaluation is limited.  There is a linear
 density in the left lower lung which is most compatible with atelectasis.  No
 convincing signs of pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, normal.
