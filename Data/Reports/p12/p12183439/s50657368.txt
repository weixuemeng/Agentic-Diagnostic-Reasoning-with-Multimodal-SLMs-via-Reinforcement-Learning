                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vertigo, emesis on waking this morning with transient chest pain and
 shortness of breath 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is prominence of the
 pulmonary vascular markings, but no pulmonary edema is present.  Minimal
 streaky opacities in the lung bases are compatible with atelectatic changes. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal
 degenerative changes are seen within the imaged spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
