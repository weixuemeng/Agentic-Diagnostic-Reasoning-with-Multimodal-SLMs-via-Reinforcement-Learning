                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old after percutaneous aortic valve replacement.  Productive
 cough and low-grade fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  There is sufficient consolidation
 at the right lung base, which obscure that hemidiaphragm on the lateral view
 and this could be pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. 
 Post-operative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is essentially stable. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in
 their respective positions and the CoreValve is grossly unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
