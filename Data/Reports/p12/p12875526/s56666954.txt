                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and recent AV replacement, assess acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  A right chest wall
 pacer is again seen with leads extending to the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There has been a prior valve replacement, which projects over the
 mid heart.  The heart remains moderately enlarged with a globular
 configuration.  There is a persistent right pleural effusion which when
 compared with the prior exam is slightly increased in size.  There is no left
 effusion.  There is likely a component of right basal atelectasis due to
 compression.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Tiny clips project over the superior
 mediastinum.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased right pleural effusion.  Persistent
 cardiomegaly.
