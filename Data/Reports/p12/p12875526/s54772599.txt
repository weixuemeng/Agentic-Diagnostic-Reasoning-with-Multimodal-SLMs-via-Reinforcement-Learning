                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fall, assess for acute process.
 
 Portable chest radiograph was obtained.  The endotracheal tube is in the
 trachea,  1.9 cm above the carina, and should not be advanced any further. 
 Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach.  Lungs are low in volume which
 limits assessment; however, bilateral hazy opacification is compatible with
 moderate pulmonary edema and likely atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is at
 least mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.
