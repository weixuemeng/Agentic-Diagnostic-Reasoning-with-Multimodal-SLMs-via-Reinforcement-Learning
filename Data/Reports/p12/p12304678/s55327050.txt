                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 supine AP views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 frontal AP views of the chest were obtained.  Overlying trauma board
 slightly limits evaluation.  The endotracheal tube tip position changes in
 location between the 2 views and terminates approximately 4.3 to a 8.2 cm from
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the
 inferior borders on the film.  Heart size is likely top normal.  The aorta is
 markedly tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Focal ill-defined opacity within the left mid lung field is
 concerning for an area of infection.  Nodular opacity measuring 12 mm
 projecting over left lung base is likely a nipple shadow.  Streaky right
 basilar and left upper lobe opacities may reflect infection or atelectasis. 
 No definite pneumothorax is identified, nor is there a large pleural effusion.
 No acute osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip terminates between 4 and 8 cm from the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube tip is in standard position.
 
 2. Ill-defined focal opacity in the left mid lung field which is concerning
 for infectious process.  Right basilar and left upper lobe streaky opacities
 could also reflect atelectasis or infection.
