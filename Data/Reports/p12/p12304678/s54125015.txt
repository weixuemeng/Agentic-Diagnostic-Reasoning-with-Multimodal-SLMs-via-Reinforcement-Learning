                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain and crackles, worsening pneumonia or fluid
 overload.   
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuos.  Left upper lobe irregular
 peribronchial opacity is better assessed in prior CT from ___, smaller
 and less conspicuous when compared to prior chest x-ray.  Continued followup
 is recommended until resolution to exclude malignancy.  Bibasilar opacities
 larger on the right side are consistent with atelectasis.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is right mid
 scoliosis.
