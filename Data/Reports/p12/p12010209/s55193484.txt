                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 minimally decreased, likely caused by a lesser inspiratory effort than on
 occasion of the previous examination.  However, a plate-like zone of increased
 density at the right lung base is visible both on the lateral and on the
 frontal image.  The morphology of this change rather suggestive of
 atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting could also reflect
 pneumonia.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with minimal enlargement of the leftventricle.  Mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
