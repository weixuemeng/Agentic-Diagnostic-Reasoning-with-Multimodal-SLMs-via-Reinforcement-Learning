                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia with persistent fevers, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Previously noted patchy ill-defined opacities within
 the right lower lobe have slightly improved.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improving patchy opacity within the right lower lobe likely reflective of
 resolving pneumonia.
