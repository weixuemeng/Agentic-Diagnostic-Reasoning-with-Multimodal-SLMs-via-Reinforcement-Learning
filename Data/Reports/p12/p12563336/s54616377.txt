 INDICATION:  Thoracic back pain after MVC.  Restrained driver, rear-ended into
 the vehicle in front of him.  Evaluate for evidence of fracture or trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are
 normally expanded and clear.  There is no focal air space consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There are three
 small relatively linear densities projecting near the inferior aspect likely
 related to the humeral heads, perhaps from prior procedure.  This is not
 visualized on the frontal projection.  
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
 grossly intact without evidence of displaced fracture.  The upper thoracic
 vertebral body levels are obscured by the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
