                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath  // assess for
 improvement s/p diuresis versus pneumonia      assess for improvement s/p
 diuresis versus pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. However, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion is less prominent. There are residual areas of opacification at the
 bases. Although this could reflect residual congestion and atelectatic
 changes, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be
 excluded.
