                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right internal jugular
 central catheter with the tip in the mid to upper SVC, as well as multiple
 sternotomy wires and surgical clips.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Again
 seen are bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions, with decrease in size
 of the left pleural effusion.  There is no focal consolidation.  On lateral
 view, anterior air-fluid levels are likely within the pleural space,
 representing a small pneumothorax and effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left pneumothorax and bilateral small to moderately sized pleural
 effusions, with slight decrease in the left pleural effusion.
