                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___, and ___, as well
 as ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe appears only slightly
 increased compared to earlier studies from ___ and ___, most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased patchy right lower lung opacity, although
 probably attributable to waxing and waning atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
