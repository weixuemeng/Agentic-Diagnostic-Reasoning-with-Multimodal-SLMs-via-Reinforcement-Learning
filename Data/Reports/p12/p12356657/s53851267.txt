 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, intubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 00:31 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina. 
 There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise,
 the radiograph looks unchanged, the nasogastric tube and the right PICC line
 are in constant position.  Constant bullous lesion at the right lateral lung
 base, accompanied by an area of parenchymal opacity.  Signs indicative of
 pulmonary hypertension persist.
