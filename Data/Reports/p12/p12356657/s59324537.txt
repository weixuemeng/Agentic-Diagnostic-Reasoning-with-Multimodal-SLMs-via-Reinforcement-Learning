                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:55 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The left lung, notably at the bases, is better ventilated than on the
 previous image.  On the right, a combination of a small pleural effusion and a
 parenchymal opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, is constant in appearance.
 The patient continues to have a right PICC line in unchanged position. 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, without
 overt pulmonary edema.
