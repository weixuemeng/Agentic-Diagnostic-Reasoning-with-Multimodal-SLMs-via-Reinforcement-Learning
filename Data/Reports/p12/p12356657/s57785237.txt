                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:16 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ileus after Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiograph ___ and to abdominal
 radiographs subsequently 7:54 a.m. on ___:40 p.m. on ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube, with a wire stylet in place ends alongside an upper enteric
 drainage tube in the non-distended stomach.  The colon is moderately distended
 and occupies midline Morgagni hernia.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema,
 bibasilar consolidation or atelectasis are unchanged since chest radiograph on
 ___.  Small right pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly are unchanged.
 Diaphragmatic pleural calcification probably explains the redundancy of the
 right diaphragmatic contour simulating free air in the upper abdomen or in the
 subpulmonic pleural space, but I doubt either is the case.  Once again,
 tracheostomy tube abuts the left wall of the trachea and should be evaluated
 clinically.  Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
