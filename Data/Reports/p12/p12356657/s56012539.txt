                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube has been replaced by a nasogastric tube, terminating
 within the stomach.  Stable cardiomegaly and worsening pulmonary vascular
 congestion accompanied by worsening pulmonary edema.  There remains a more
 confluent asymmetrical area of opacification in the right lower lobe, which
 could reflect a pneumonia, slightly improved at the extreme right base. 
 Adjacent right pleural effusion is also slightly better.  Left pleural
 effusion cannot be well assessed due to exclusion of left costophrenic angle
 from the radiograph.
