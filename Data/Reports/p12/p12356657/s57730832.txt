                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:40 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with pneumoperitoneum.  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two radiographs of the chest fail to include the lateral aspect
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  Reduncancy of the right diaphragmatic pleural
 surface, including pleural calcification, and pleural effusion in the
 posterior sulcus simulate pneumoperitoneum. If symptoms persist, I would
 repeat an upright examination including the entire diaphragm when feasible,
 and if there is still ambiguity about pneumoperitoneum, decubitus views should
 be obtained.
 
 Small right pleural effusion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema have
 probably worsened over the course of ___ hours.  Heart is top normal size. 
 Mediastinal veins are engorged.  Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC. 
 Dobbhoff feeding tube is coiled in the stomach, with the guidewire withdrawn
 at least 8 cm from the tip.
 
 Distended large bowel looped in the midline extends above the plane of the
 diaphragm is  probably in a Morgagni hernia.
 
 Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left wall of the trachea and should be
 evaluated clinically.
