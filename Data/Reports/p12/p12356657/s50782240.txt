                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy with possible effusion, infiltrate, and pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacification is consistent with some combination
 of pleural effusion and volume loss in the right lower lobe.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 On the left, there is hazy opacification at the left base, consistent with
 pleural effusion and some compressive atelectasis.
