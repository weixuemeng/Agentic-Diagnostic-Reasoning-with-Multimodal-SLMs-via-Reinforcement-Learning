 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The tube projects over the mid-to-distal parts of the
 stomach.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The
 other monitoring and support devices are constant in appearance.  No
 substantial change in appearance of the lung parenchyma and the cardiac
 silhouette.  A mild increase in atelectatic lung regions at the right lung
 bases might be present.
