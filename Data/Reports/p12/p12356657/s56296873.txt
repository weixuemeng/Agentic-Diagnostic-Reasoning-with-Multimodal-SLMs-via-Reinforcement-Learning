                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are constant.  The pre-described opacities at the right lung base and
 in the right perihilar areas are mildly improved.  The lung is also more
 transparent on the left, likely reflecting improved ventilation of the left
 lower lobe.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
