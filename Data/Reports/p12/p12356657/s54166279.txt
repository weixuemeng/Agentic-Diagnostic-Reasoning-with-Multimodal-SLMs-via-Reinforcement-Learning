                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary edema, evaluation for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was provided.  Lung volume is still low
 with bilateral opacification due to moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema,
 minimally improved at the right base.  Small right pleural effusion and
 atelectasis are unchanged.  Left lung base has not been included in chest
 x-ray.  The monitoring and support devices remain in place, unchanged since
 prior chest x-ray.  Heart size is still enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Minimal interval increase of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral opacification due to moderate-to-severe
 pulmonary edema with interval increase of left pleural effusion, while the
 right lung base has improved ventilation likely for reduced pulmonary edema. 
 All the monitoring devices are unchanged.
