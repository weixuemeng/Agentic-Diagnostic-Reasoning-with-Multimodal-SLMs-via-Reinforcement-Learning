                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  A tracheostomy tube
 is appropriately positioned.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube tip terminates within
 the oropharynx.  The right PICC is within the upper SVC.  Again seen is
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, similar to the prior exam.  Areas of
 consolidation at the bases, right greater than left, may represent pneumonia
 and are unchanged since the previous exam allowing for patient rotation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube within the oropharynx.  Otherwise, no significant
 change in the lung parenchyma.
