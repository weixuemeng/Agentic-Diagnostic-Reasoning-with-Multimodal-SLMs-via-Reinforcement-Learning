                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right below-knee amputation with known atelectasis. 
 Question of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:26 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior
 radiograph shows interval worsening of opacification at the bases owing to
 basilar atelectasis. This could represent developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation.  There persists a small right pleural
 effusion.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contour is mildly enlarged, but unchanged from the
 prior radiographs. Of note, there is persistent narrowing of the tracheal air
 column, raising the concern for tracheal stenosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 1. Interval worsening of bibasilar opacities concerning for
 pneumonia or bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Possible tracheal stenosis. Recommend PA and lateral views when the patient
 is able to tolerate this.
