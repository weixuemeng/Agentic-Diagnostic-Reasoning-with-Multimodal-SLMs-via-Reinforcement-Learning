                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph was requested to assess for free intraperitoneal
 air.  Based on the presence of partially layering bilateral pleural effusions,
 this appears to be a semi-upright rather than fully upright radiograph.  Thus,
 a left lateral decubitus radiograph or repeat fully upright radiograph of the
 chest is recommended to assess for free intraperitoneal air.  Indwelling
 support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and overall
 appearance of cardiomediastinal contours, lungs and pleura are unchanged since
 the recent chest radiograph.
