                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheostomy.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Tracheostomy again is directed to the lateral
 tracheal wall and should be clinically examined.  Enteric tube again noted.  A
 right upper extremity PICC terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged and mild pulmonary edema persists.  A
 moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis is unchanged in
 volume. Hazy opacity over the left lung base likely represents pleural fluid
 as seen on the prior chest CT. No pneumothorax.
