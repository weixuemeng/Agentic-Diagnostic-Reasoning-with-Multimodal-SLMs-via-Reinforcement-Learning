                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities are unchanged in severity and distribution.
 
 The changes predominate on the left, and at the level of the left lung base,
 several air bronchograms are seen.  The morphology and constant location of
 this change could suggest that the pre-existing pulmonary edema is complicated
 by left lower lung pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is required.  No change in
 appearance of a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
