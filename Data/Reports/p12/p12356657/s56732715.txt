                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable; there is persistent
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  A confluent opacity at the right lung base has
 worsened, with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and part of the right
 heart border.  These findings may represent atelectasis with or without
 coexisting infection in the right lower lobe and part of the right middle
 lobe.  There is an adjacent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  These
 findings are superimposed upon baseline areas of scarring and pleural
 thickening shown on outside abdominal CT of ___, with findings
 suggestive of right fibrothorax.  On the left, hazy opacity in the left
 infrahilar region has slightly improved since the recent chest x-ray of
 ___, and a linear focus of atelectasis has resolved.
