                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.  Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The patient is very rotated. 
 Tracheostomy tube is not well visualized, probably in unchanged position. 
 There is mild vascular congestion improved from prior study.  Bilateral
 opacities larger on the right side are grossly unchanged, worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Small right effusion is stable.
