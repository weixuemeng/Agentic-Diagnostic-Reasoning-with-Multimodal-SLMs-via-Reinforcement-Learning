                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal views of the chest demonstrate the endotracheal tube is
 in appropriate position, terminating 7 cm above the level of the carina.  An
 orogastric tube is also seen, but the tip lies at the gastroesophageal
 junction with side hole above the level of the diaphragm, and should be
 advanced several centimeters to ensure placement in the stomach.  Right
 pleural plaques are again seen along with bibasilar atelectasis.  A small
 right pleural effusion remains.  There is no pneumothorax and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  OG tube with side hole above the level of the diaphragm, which
 could be advanced several centimeters for appropriate positioning in the
 stomach.
