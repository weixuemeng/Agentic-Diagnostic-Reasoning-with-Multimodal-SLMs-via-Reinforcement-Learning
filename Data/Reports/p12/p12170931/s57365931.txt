                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of trauma.  Please evaluate for any pathology.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT performed on the same day.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal supine radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube
 traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film.  The
 bases of the lungs demonstrate mild atelectasis otherwise no focal
 consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.  Heart size is
 normal. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is secondary to mediastinal fat
 as seen on the CT. Note is made of a subtle nondisplaced fracture of the right
 lateral 5th rib, better evaluated on the recent CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube terminate 5.6 cm above the carina.  No acute intrathoracic
 abnormalities are identified.  There is a subtle, nondisplaced fracture of the
 right lateral 5th rib.
