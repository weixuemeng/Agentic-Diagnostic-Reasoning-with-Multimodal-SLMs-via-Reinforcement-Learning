 INDICATION:  Fever and neutropenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___; CT examinations from
 ___ and ___. 
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Lung
 volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar linear
 opacities are most compatible with minor atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  An oval opacity in the mid lung is
 consistent with a lung nodule which appears unchanged since at least a prior
 CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
