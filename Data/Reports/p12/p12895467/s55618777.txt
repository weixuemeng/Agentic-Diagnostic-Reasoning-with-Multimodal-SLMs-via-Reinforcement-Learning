                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent right lower lobe pneumonia, followup for
 clearing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification in the right lower lobe and the possible
 smaller region has all resolved over the past four weeks.  Lungs are fully
 expanded and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces.  Osteophytes in the mid thoracic spine seen on the lateral
 view should not be mistaken for lung lesions.
