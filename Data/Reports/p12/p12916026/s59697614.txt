                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left subcostal pain.  Consider rib fracture
 or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 I see no displaced rib fracture, but conventional chest radiographs are not
 sensitive in finding subtle chest cage trauma.  Focal findings should be
 marked for rib detail views.
