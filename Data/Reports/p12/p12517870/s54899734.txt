 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p EVAR  // eval ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  RADIOGRAPHS FROM ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is 4.4 cm above the carina, unchanged and appropriately
 sited.  There is a new nasogastric tube whose side port is at the GE junction
 and could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement.  There is unchanged
 cardiomegaly and a left retrocardiac opacity. There is a small left-sided
 pleural effusion and atelectasis at the lung bases.  Vague opacity in the
 right upper lobe is seen and attention to this area is recommended on
 subsequent exams to exclude developing pneumonia.
