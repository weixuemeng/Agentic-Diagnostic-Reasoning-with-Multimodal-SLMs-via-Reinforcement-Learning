                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal, cardiac and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests
 minor atelectasis associated with a mildly elevated left hemidiaphragm,
 although less striking than before.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
