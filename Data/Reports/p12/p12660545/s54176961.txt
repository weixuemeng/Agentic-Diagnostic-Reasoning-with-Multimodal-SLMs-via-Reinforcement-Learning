                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath, rhonchi in the right lung fields.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes.  Multifocal
 consolidative opacities within the right lung and left lung base are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures with likely a element of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
