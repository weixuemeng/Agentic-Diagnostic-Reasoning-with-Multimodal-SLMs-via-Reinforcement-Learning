                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is a new focal opacity at the right lung base and a subtle opacity at
 the left base opacity as well.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Mitral annular
 calcifications are noted as well as dense atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aorta.  No displaced fractures.  Note is made of a right cervical rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.  These could
 represent atelectasis; however, clinical correlation is necessary as infection
 is not excluded.
