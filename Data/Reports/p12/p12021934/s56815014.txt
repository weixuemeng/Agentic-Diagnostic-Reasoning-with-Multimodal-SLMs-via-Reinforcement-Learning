    1. Rounded opacity in the right midlung zone. Further evaluation with
  cross-sectional imaging is recommended. Alternatively, a lateral view could be
  performed to assist in localization.
    2. Bibasilar patchy opacities could reflect aspiration or, provided low lung
  volumes, atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia. Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.
 
 There is a 2.8 cm rounded opacity seen in the right mid lung zone, projecting
 over the posterior right seventh rib. The mass shows central areas of lower
 attenuation suggesting either air bronchograms or necrosis.  Bibasilar
 opacities could reflect aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart is normal size.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Rounded opacity in the right midlung zone. Further evaluation performed at
 full inspiration with a lateral view is recommended.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities could reflect aspiration or, provided low lung
 volumes, atelectasis.
