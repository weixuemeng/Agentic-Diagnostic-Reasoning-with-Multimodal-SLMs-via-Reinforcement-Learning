                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? aspiration and round R-sided opacity  //
 Please assess for interval change (? resolution of aspiration, further
 characterization of R-sided opacity)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Redemonstrated is a large, somewhat ill-defined, heterogeneous and rounded
 opacity within the right mid lung. Furthermore, there is apparent tethering of
 the lesion, which may suggest underlying spiculation. Linear opacities within
 the left lower lobe and retrocardiac region have increased as compared to the
 prior examination, suggestive of worsening atelectasis. The upper lung zones
 are clear. There is no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Large, rounded lesion in the right mid lung, demonstrating potential
 tethering to the adjacent structures. Recommend cross-sectional imaging for
 further lesion characterization.
 2. Worsening left basilar and retrocardiac linear opacities, suggestive of
 atelectasis although underlying aspiration/infection cannot be excluded.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were entered into the radiology dashboard by Dr.
 ___ ___:45 on ___.
