 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now in semi-erect
 position.  There is a progression of the left basal parenchymal opacity that
 is now substantially more extensive and severe. In addition, there is minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left
 pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
