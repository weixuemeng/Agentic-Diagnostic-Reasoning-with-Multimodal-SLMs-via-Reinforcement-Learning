 the frontal view alone I cannot tell whether the tube is in the airway or the
 esophagus. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. Severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pleural effusion is small if any. Left internal
 jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC on all 3 images. There is
 no pneumothorax.
