                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette accompanied by
 upper zone vascular redistribution.  Right lung predominant interstitial
 opacities likely represent asymmetrical interstitial edema.  A more confluent
 opacity persists in the right lower lobe, best visualized on the lateral view.
 Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, with intrafissural extension on
 the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity, which may be due to focal pneumonia
 or atelectasis.
 2.  Mild interstitial edema and small pleural effusions.
