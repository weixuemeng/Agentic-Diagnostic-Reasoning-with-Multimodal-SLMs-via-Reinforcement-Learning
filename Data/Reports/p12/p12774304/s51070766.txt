                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent stroke, question fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared with ___, theleft subclavian central line has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  An orogastric-type tube is present.  The tip is not
 well seen due to underpenetration -- it is difficult to trace below the level
 of the lower esophagus, though this may be due to technical limitations.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is cardiomegaly,
 with a water bottle configuration that could reflect the presence of some
 pericardial fluid.  The hila are prominent, but not clearly delineated.  There
 is increased opacity in the upper zones as well as pulmonary vascular plethora
 and diffuse vascular blurring.  No gross effusion or definite focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  
 
 Compared to the prior film, the degree of vascular engorgement has decreased
 slightly, but some residual less well-defined vascular blurring is present. 
 Cardiomegaly is similar. though slightly different in configuration. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable background COPD.  Cardiomegaly with CHF and interstitial
 edema, probably somewhat improved.  No gross effusion or definite focal
 consolidation.
