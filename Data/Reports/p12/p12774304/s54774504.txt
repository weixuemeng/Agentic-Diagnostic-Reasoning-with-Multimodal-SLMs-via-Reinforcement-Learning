                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:58.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with altered mental status, question
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 13:28.
 
 Semi-erect and lateral images of the chest ___ at 10:58 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion can also have this appearance.  Mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.  There is
 thickening of the major fissure seen on the lateral projection which may be
 chronic or represent loculated fluid.  On the lateral projection, there is a
 patchy opacity in the lower lung which when correlated with the frontal
 projection may be in the medial right lower lobe, although it is difficult to
 ascertain given the underpenetration in this region.  Findings could represent
 a developing pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation is advised and close followup imaging should be considered.   The
 pulmonary vasculature also appears cephalized suggesting underlying pulmonary
 venous hypertension.  No pleural effusions.  Left shoulder replacement again
 visualized. Degenerative changes in the spine with no acute bony abnormality
 appreciated Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone
 of ___ at 12:50 p.m.
