                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:50 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Invasive breast carcinoma.  Emesis and acute hypoxia.  Has there
 been aspiration?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower today and there is right infrahilar opacification. 
 This could be an early stage of aspiration and should be followed to see if
 pneumonia develops.  There is no consolidation on the left.  Given the
 clinical history, it would be reasonable to consider acute pulmonary embolus
 as a cause of both emesis and hypoxia.
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no hilar enlargement.  Infusion port ends
 close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with the member of the patient care team
 at 11:39, 4 minutes after the findings were recognized.
