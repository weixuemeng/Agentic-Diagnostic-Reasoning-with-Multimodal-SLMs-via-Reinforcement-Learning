                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, tachycardia and crackles.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:  Relatively poor inspiratory effort.  There is evidence of bilateral
 minimal bronchial wall thickening.  Some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature
 is noted.  There is probably some atelectasis in both lung bases, but no
 definitive evidence of pneumonia is noted.  Repeat departmental radiograph may
 be useful.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Some non-specific bronchial wall thickening, linear probably
 atelectatic changes at the bases.  No definitive pneumonia.  Repeat
 radiographs would be useful.
