                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST FILM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube and NG tube have been removed.  The
 right-sided PICC line is again seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction. 
 There continues to be mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular
 redistribution.  There is volume loss in both lower lobes, left greater than
 right.  The left hemidiaphragm is completely obscured and it is unclear if
 this is due to only volume loss or if there is an associated effusion or
 infiltrate, with less extensive findings are also present on the right. 
 Compared to the prior study, the volume loss in the lower lobes is increased.
