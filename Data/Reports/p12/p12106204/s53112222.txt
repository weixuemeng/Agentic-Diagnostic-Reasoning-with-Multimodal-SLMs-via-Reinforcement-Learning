 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:19 PM
  ETT is 2.6 cm above carina. NG is within the stomach with sideholes just
  beyond the GE junction. RIJ is in the proximal IVC. Left sided pleural
  effusion and likely accompanying atelectasis is simliar to the ___ study from
  ___. Right sided opacities are more evident than on prior studies (perhaps
  due to better inspiration) and may reflect atelectasis, though given proximity
  to procedure, aspiration cannot be excluded. No ptx.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, evaluation for pneumothorax or
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.7 cm above the carina.
 There is improved ventilation of the right lung base.  The atelectasis and
 small pleural effusion on the left, however, are unchanged.  The coiled PICC
 line in the lower parts of the internal jugular vein is unchanged.  The
 malposition was noted on the radiograph from ___, 1:21 p.m. and has
 not been changed.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged evidence of mild
 pulmonary edema.
