                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is
 consistent with some continued increase in pulmonary venous pressure.  The
 area behind the heart is extremely difficult to evaluate and the possibility
 of a lingular consolidation cannot be accurately assessed.
