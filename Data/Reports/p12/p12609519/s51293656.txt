                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left thoracotomy vagotomy. Assess chest tube and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 left chest tube with tip projecting between the left posterior sixth and
 seventh ribs. Sideports are intrathoracic in appropriate position.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with vascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.
 New small left pleural effusion is present. No right pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax. Enlargement of heart size is due to patient positioning and low
 lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left chest tube in appropriate position. No pneumothorax.
 2. Hypoinflated lungs with vascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. New small left pleural effusion.
