                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately
 4 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the
 tip out of the field of view.  The lung volumes are low, accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no large airspace opacity, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
