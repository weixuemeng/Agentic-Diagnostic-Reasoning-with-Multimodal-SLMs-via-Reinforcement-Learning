                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man found down, with b/l upper lobe infiltrates on
 chest CT,  // ?pulmonary edema, aspiration?      ?pulmonary edema, aspiration?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the CT study of ___, the areas of increased
 opacification in the upper lungs bilaterally were much better seen on the
 cross-sectional imaging study.
 There are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation
 in pulmonary venous pressure.
