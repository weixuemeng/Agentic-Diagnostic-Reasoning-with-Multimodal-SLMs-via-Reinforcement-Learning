                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Posterior head fullness and unsteadiness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left
 hemidiaphragmatic pleural calcifications again noted likely reflecting prior
 asbestos exposure. Upper lobe lucency suggests emphysema.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
