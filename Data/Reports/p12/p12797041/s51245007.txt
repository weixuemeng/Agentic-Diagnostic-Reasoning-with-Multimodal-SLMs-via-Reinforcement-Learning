                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are increased, likely due to clinically suspected
 COPD.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Possible mild
 bronchial wall thickening is seen in the perihilar regions, best visualized on
 the lateral view.  No pleural effusion.  Bones are demineralized, and note is
 made of scoliosis and degenerative changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overinflated lungs and bronchial wall thickening, findings which could be
 due to chronic bronchitis in the setting of a history of smoking and chronic
 cough.
 
 2.  No acute pulmonary abnormality.
