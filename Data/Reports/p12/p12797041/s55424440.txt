                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and feels weak all over
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Heart size is normal.  Again demonstrated is a consolidative opacity
 within the right perihilar and suprahilar region, unchanged from chest
 radiograph from ___ but new compared to the CT chest from ___.  Remainder of the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Spiculated opacity within the right lung base appears new compared to the
 previous exam from ___, and likely present on the prior CT but
 increased in size.  Other previously demonstrated nodules throughout the lungs
 appear grossly unchanged, the largest within the right lower lobe along the
 minor fissure.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Clips are
 seen in the right upper quadrant compatible prior cholecystectomy.  Known
 osseous metastatic lesions are better assessed on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Consolidative opacity within the right perihilar region, not substantially
 changed in the interval.  Findings again likely relate to prior radiation
 changes if there has been such a history.
 2. Diffuse pulmonary nodules compatible with metastases including interval
 increase in size of at least 1 lesion in the right lower lobe.
 3. Known osseous metastases are better assessed on the previous CT.
