                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post fall from bicycle and left
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.  Lung
 volumes are low, accentuating the lung markings.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect atelectasis or consolidation.  No effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  A non-displaced left lateral rib fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit evaluation.  No pneumothorax. 
 Non-displaced left lateral rib fracture.
