                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rib fractures, assessment for lung parenchymal changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing opacity
 at the left lung base, likely caused by a small left pleural effusion.  The
 pre-existing left basal atelectasis are unchanged.  Unchanged low lung volumes
 and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, unremarkable right lung.
 
 The clinically known non-displaced left rib fractures are not clearly
 visualized on the radiograph.
