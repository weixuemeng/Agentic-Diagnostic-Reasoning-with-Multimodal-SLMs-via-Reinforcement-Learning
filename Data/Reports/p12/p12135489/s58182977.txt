 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:46 AM
  Increased opacification at the left lung base, likely pleural effusion and
  atelectasis. Underlying consolidation could also be present and cannot be
  excluded. Lung volumes are very low, limiting evaluation. Discussed with ___
  ___ by phone at 12:45 a.m. on ___ at time of initial review of the
  study in response to wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.  Continued pain and shortness of
 breath.
 
 When compared to prior study performed seven hours earlier, there has been
 interval increase in left lower lobe opacity consistent with increasing
 pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is
 stable.  There are lower lung volumes that limit the evaluation of this study.
 Cardiac size cannot be evaluated , is obscured by the pleural parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Widened mediastinum is unchanged.  The small left pneumothorax
 is unchanged allowing for the difference in positioning of the patient.
