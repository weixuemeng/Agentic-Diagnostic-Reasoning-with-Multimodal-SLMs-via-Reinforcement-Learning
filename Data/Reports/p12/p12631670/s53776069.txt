                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male pacemaker breakthrough through the skin. 
 Evaluate for lead migration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacemaker projecting over the left axilla is re-demonstrated. 
 Two right ventricular, one right atrial and one left coronary sinus leads are
 unchanged in position compared with prior exam.  Sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Surgical clips are noted within the mediastinum compatible with prior CABG.
 
 Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 prominence of interstitial markings, but no focal parenchymal opacities.  The
 heart size is moderately to severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Pacemaker leads in unchanged location compared with prior exam.
