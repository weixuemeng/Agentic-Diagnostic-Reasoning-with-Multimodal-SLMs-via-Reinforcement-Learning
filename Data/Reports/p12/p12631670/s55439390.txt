                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing white blood cell count.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to dense
 overlying soft tissues.
 
 Within these limitations, there is dense retrocardiac opacification, seen best
 on the lateral view, which may be due to atelectasis related to stable
 moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  However, pneumonia is a consideration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.   Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense retrocardiac opacification could be consistent with
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, though atelectasis related to
 stable cardiomegaly is also likely.
