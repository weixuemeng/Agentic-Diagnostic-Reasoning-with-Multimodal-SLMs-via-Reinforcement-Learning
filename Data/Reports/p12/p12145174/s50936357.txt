                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate feeding tube position in a patient with reflux of tube
 feeds concerning for change in position, admitted for hypercalcemia of unknown
 etiology and acute pancreatitis complicated by infected necrosis status post
 IR drainage and laparotomy with cholecystectomy, as well as pancreatic
 debridement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left PICC terminating
 in the low SVC.  The enteric tube now terminates in the upper
 esophagus/hypopharynx.
 
 Lung volumes are lower, with prominence of cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.  There has been interval improvement of bibasilar
 opacities and vascular congestion, with only mild atelectasis remaining in the
 bilateral lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube now terminates in the upper esophagus/ hypopharynx. 
 Subsequent radiographs demonstrating advancement are dictated separately.
 2. Improvement of bilateral opacities and vascular congestion, now with only
 mild bibasilar atelectasis remaining.
