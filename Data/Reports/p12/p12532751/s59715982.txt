                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sickle cell anemia, L shift and chills at
 home.  // Please evalate for infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without
 vascular congestion. No acute pneumonia.
 
 
 
 Striking abnormality involving the bony structures with avascular necrosis
 involving both humeral heads and dense bones. Abnormality in the thoracic
 spine is consistent with the diagnosis of sickle cell disease, though the
 classic H- tiype vertebra are not present.
 
 
 
 There are shortened clavicles bilaterally. This is not a characteristic of
 sickle cell disease. The appearance is different from the subperiosteal
 resorption characteristic of hyperparathyroidism. A tarda former of
 cleidocranial dysostosis could be considered.
