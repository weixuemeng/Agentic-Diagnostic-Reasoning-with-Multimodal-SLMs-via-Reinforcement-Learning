                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old man with history of increased abdominal
 girth and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  There is
 minimal blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle which may be due to
 a trace effusion.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle, new
 since the prior study, may be due to a trace pleural effusion.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.
