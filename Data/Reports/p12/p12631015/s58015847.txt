 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis  // r/o
 pneumothorax      r/o pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion is not appreciably smaller, compared to ___.  There is no pneumothorax.  The absence of leftward mediastinal shift
 suggests that the pleural effusion is not acute, and is matched by an
 equivalent loss of volume in the collapsed right middle and lower lobes. 
 Heart size is indeterminate since the right heart border is obscured.  Left
 lung is grossly clear and there is no appreciable left pleural effusion.
