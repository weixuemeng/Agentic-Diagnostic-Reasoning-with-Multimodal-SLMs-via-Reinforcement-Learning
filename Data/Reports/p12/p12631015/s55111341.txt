                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with decreased appetite and ___ lb wt loss in 6
 wks // PNA? effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is opacification of the right lung base/right cardiophrenic angle, which
 is likely due to prominent pericardial fat as seen on the prior chest CT
 performed on ___.  Superimposed streaky opacities at the lung
 bases likely represent atelectasis, although there may be a component of
 scarring at the right lung base.  No focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. 
 Trace right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis/scarring, without
 evidence of focal pneumonia.
 2. Trace right pleural effusion.
