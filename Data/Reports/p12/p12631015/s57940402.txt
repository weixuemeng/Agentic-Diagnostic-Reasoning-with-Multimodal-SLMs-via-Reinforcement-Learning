                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval development of a large right pleural effusion.  Right
 basilar opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.  Trace left pleural effusion is also present.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to assess
 given the presence of a large right pleural effusion.  Aorta is mildly
 unfolded.  No pulmonary edema is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of large right and trace left bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.
