                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with known ascites, presenting with worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities at the lung bases are
 consistent with areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation
 is identified to suggest pneumonia.  Overall diffuse increased attenuation of
 the lungs is likely secondary to technical factors since no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or overt edema is identified.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
