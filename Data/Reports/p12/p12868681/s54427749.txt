                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of increased white blood cell count and altered mental
 status.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is obscuration of the left hemi diaphragm consistent with left lower
 lobe volume loss. There is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 consistent with a small effusion, however the lateral view is of suboptimal
 quality. A hemodialysis catheter and PICC line are again seen, unchanged in
 position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
 normal limits. The right lung is clear and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on either side.
