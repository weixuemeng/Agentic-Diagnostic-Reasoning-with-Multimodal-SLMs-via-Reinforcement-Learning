                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with sepsis, now status post internal jugular
 central line placement.  Assess line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and from ___
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left internal jugular central
 venous catheter terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein
 and upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Basilar atelectasis is likely.  No large pleural
 effusions are evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are exaggerated
 due to the AP technique.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes and probable basilar atelectasis 
 2.  Left internal jugular catheter terminating at the left brachiocephalic/SVC
 junction.
