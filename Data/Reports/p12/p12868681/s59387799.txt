 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  Acute mental status change and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Shortly after the study, a preliminary interpretation was provided by Dr.
 ___ ___ stated "Improved aeration of the left lung base, minimal
 right-sided atelectasis.  Otherwise, unchanged exam.  No acute findings."
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including tortuosity
 of a calcified aorta.  A central venous catheter terminates in the right
 atrium, also not significantly changed.  Left basilar opacity has resolved. 
 However, there is a new streaky right basilar opacity.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Resolution of opacity at the left lung base.  New streaky right basilar
 opacity, typical for atelectasis but if symptoms were to persist, then
 short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to reassess since it is
 difficult to completely exclude an early pneumonia.
