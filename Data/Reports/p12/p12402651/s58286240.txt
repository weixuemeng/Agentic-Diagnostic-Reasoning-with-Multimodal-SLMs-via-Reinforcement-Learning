 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Lateral
 view is limited secondary to motion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable,
 noting mild cardiomegaly.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the arch. 
 Right-sided rib deformities are suggestive of chronic fractures.  Partially
 visualized density in the proximal left humerus may be from prior infarct or
 enchondroma.  Mid thoracic vertebral body height loss with better seen on
 prior, noting that the bones are not well assessed on the lateral view on the
 current exam.  Surgical clips project over the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
