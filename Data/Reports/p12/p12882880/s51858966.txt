 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:08 PM
  Focal opacity within the periphery of the right lung base, which could reflect
  atelectasis/scarring as this was an area that previously showed rounded
  atelectasis in ___, but is more pronounced compared to prior chest radiograph
  from ___, likely due to reduced lung volumes.  Recommend short
  interval follow up radiographs with improved inspiratory effort for further
  assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest radiograph ___,
 CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  Focal
 opacity along the peripheral aspect of the right lung base is more pronounced
 compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but correlated to an area
 of rounded atelectasis on the prior radiograph and CT from ___, and
 may relate to atelectasis/scarring which is accentuated by the decreased lung
 volumes.  This is adjacent to remote right rib fractures.  Left lung is clear.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes are noted
 in both glenohumeral joints.  Multiple clips are again seen in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacity within the periphery of the right lung base, which could reflect
 atelectasis/scarring as this was an area that previously showed rounded
 atelectasis in ___, but is more pronounced compared to prior chest radiograph
 from ___, likely due to reduced lung volumes.  Recommend short
 interval follow up radiographs with improved inspiratory effort for further
 assessment.
