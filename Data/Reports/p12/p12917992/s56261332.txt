                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and possible low-grade tuberculosis,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a dense calcified
 opacity in the right paratracheal region which likely represents a calcified
 lymph node consistent with granulomatous disease.  Bibasilar coarse opacities
 likely represent a combination of atelectasis and fibrosis.  The upper and mid
 lungs are clear bilaterally.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
 2.  Calcified right hilar node from granulomatous disease.
 3.  Bibasilar fibrotic changes consistent with chronic lung disease.
