 abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and abdominal CT from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  There is chronic mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle reflects basilar
 atelectasis and possible small effusion.  No focal consolidation or pulmonary
 nodules/masses.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Again
 noted is a calcified right paratracheal lymph node.  The osseous structures
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
