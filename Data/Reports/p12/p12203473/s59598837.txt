                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with n/v/d since this am, history of sarcoidosis.  Pt poor
 historian.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Subtle hazy projecting over the
 right upper lung seen only on the first image of this series, is concerning
 for an early pneumonia.  Coarsened lung markings likely reflect chronic lung
 disease in this patient with known sarcoidosis.  Emphysema difficult to
 exclude.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of edema or
 congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly within normal
 limits.  No acute bony injury.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic lung disease with subtle hazy opacity projecting over the right upper
 lung on the first image of the series, possibly representing an early
 pneumonia.
