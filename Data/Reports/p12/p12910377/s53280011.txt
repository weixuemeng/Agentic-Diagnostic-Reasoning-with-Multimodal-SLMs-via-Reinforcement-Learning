                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post cervical mediastinoscopy. 
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest.  Normal lungs, heart
 and pleural surfaces.  Lobulation of the mediastinal contour is due to an
 anterior mediastinal multicystic lesion which is better characterized on the
 prior chest CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Given the mediastinal abnormality seen on the recent chest CT, the
 appearance of the mediastinum and lungs is without evidence of hemorrahge,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
