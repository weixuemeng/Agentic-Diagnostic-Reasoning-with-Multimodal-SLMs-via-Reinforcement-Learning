                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, evaluate for pneumonia. Patient with history of
 Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as a chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low. Subtle
 veil like ground-glass opacity projecting over the left and right upper lungs
 appears new from the prior exam. There is no correlate for this finding on the
 lateral projection and therefore finding is of unclear clinical significance.
 The possibility of pneumonia is not excluded. The heart and mediastinal
 contours appear grossly stable. No large effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle increase veil like opacities within the bilateral upper lungs. Findings
 raise concern for an atypical pneumonia.
