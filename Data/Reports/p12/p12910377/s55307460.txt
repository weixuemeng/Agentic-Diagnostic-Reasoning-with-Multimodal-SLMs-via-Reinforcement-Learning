 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hodkins, and picc that became coiled
 during ct study  // please assess picc line placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the tip of the subclavian catheter is
 either at the cavoatrial junction or in the upper portion of the right atrium.

 injection at CT, it would probably be best to leave the catheter where it is
 unless there are any atypical atrial beats.
 
 This information was discussed with ___, a venous access nurse.
