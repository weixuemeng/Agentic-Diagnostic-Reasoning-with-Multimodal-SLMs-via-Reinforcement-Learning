                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and lymphoma  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits. Opacity within the retrosternal region on
 the lateral view corresponds to known anterior mediastinal mass, better
 assessed on the previous PET-CT. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are noted
 within both upper lobes and left lung base, nonspecific, but infection is not
 excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known anterior mediastinal mass is better appreciated on the previous PET-CT.
 Patchy opacities in both upper lobes and left lung base are nonspecific but
 may reflect areas of infection.
