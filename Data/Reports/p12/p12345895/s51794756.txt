                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:45 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Low lung volumes crowd the lung vessels; I can say there is no pulmonary
 edema, but there is new heterogeneous opacification at the left lung base
 concerning for recent aspiration.  Slightly increased caliber of the azygos
 vein suggests that the patient is not volume depleted.
 
 Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
