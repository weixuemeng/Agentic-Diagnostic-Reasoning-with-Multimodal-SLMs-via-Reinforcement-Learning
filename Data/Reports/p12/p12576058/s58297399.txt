 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:20 PM
  Lung volumes are slightly low resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
  structures.  Bibasilar opacities are present, worse on the right.  While this
  may represent atelectasis, superimposed infection is also possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased work of breathing, to assess for vascular congestion or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increase in ill-defined
 pulmonary vessels, consistent with some pulmonary vascular congestion.  A more
 focal area of opacification at the right base could conceivably represent a
 developing infiltrate in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles with mild atelectatic changes at the
 bases.
