                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vomiting and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___. CT torso
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two frontal chest radiograph were obtained.  Right medial basilar opacity
 persists, likely reflecting a combination of known metastatic lesion with
 atelectasis. Previously noted metastatic nodules within the lungs on prior
 Chest CT are not clearly seen on the current exam.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  There is moderate convex right
 scoliosis.  The mediastinum is shifted rightward by scoliosis and the aorta is
 unfolded. Cardiac silhouette size is unchanged. Low thoracic fusion hardware
 is intact.  A right chest Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Syringothoracic shunt catheter remains coiled within the left
 hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change. Persistent right basilar opacity, likely
 reflecting a combination of known metastasis and atelectasis. Other previously
 noted metastases within the lungs on prior chest CT are not clearly noted on
 the current exam.
