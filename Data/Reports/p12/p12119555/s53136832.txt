                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with colonic adenocarcinoma metastatic
 to liver and lungs, known pleural effusion, progressive dyspneic but not
 hypoxic.  Assess for pulmonary edema and interval change in pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Again, patient is rotated to the right. 
 Asymmetric appearance of the frontal chest view is accentuated by previously
 described orthopedic hardware and vertebral body placement in the lower
 thoracic spine with moderate degree of general right-sided convex scoliosis. 
 The heart size has not changed since the preceding examination.  There is no
 evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion in the right hemithorax where the
 pulmonary vasculature can be identified.  A new diffuse haze is overlying the
 entire left-sided hemithorax.  As the patient is in steep dorsal tilt
 position, the haze can be explained by pleural effusion that is layering in
 the posterior pleural compartments.  There is no pneumothorax seen on either
 side.  A previously described right-sided Port-A-Cath system with entrance via
 the right internal jugular vein remains in unchanged position.  A previously
 existing left internal jugular approach central venous line has been
 withdrawn.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided diffuse haze over hemithorax is likely representing
 layering left-sided pleural effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion can be seen on portable chest examination.  A lateral chest view
 would confirm present made observations as relating to pleural effusions. 
 Referring physician, ___, was paged at 1:30 p.m.
