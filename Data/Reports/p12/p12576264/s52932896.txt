 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:08 PM
  1.  New moderate pulmonary edema with stable small to moderate right pleural
  effusion and new small left pleural effusion.
  2. Bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, is worrisome for
  pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
  3. Ovoid left mid lung opacity with radiopaque clip is consistent with known
  malignancy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, SOB, fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  FDG PET ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Peribronchial cuffing with cephalization of vasculature and mild cardiomegaly
 are consistent with pulmonary edema.  A persistent small to moderate right
 pleural effusion is noted with a new small left pleural effusion. 
 Heterogeneous opacities within bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left,
 have increased since prior examination and may be partially related to
 underlying pulmonary edema however right lower lobe opacity is worrisome for
 pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.  Ovoid opacity over the left mid lung is
 stable since prior examination and demonstrates a radiopaque clip is
 consistent with known malignancy.
 
 Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New moderate pulmonary edema with stable small to moderate right pleural
 effusion and new small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, is worrisome for
 pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
 3.  Ovoid left mid lung opacity with radiopaque clip is consistent with known
 malignancy.
