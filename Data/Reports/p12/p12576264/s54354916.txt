 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Bilateral hila are enlarged compatible with
 lymphadenopathy better evaluated on recent chest CT.  Increased global
 reticular markings is compatible with interstitial lung disease.  A fiducial
 marker is seen centrally within the left upper lung nodule.  A small right
 pleural effusion blunts the costophrenic angle.  There is no pneumothorax.
