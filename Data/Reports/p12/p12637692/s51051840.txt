 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sudden onset of cough and failure, wheezing, history of COPD,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing opacity at the
 right lung base has completely resolved.  However, marked signs of
 overinflation, combined to mild fluid overload, persist.  There might be
 minimal pleural effusions restricted to the dorsal costophrenic sinuses.  The
 cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged.  There is no evidence of acute
 infectious changes.  The known minimal granulomas that are calcified and
 located in the left lung apex are constant in appearance.
 
 Known valvular calcifications.
 
 Known vertebral wedge compressions, unchanged as compared to the previous
 image.
