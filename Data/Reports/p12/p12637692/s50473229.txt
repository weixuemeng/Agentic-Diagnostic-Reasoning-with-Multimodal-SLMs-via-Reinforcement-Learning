                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms, consistent
 with COPD.  This is unchanged from prior exam.  At the right base, there is a
 new somewhat linear hazy opacity, with adjacent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggestive of a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, left pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with the heart size normal. Mitral
 annular calcifications are again noted.  Multiple compression fractures and
 severe kyphosis are noted, and not significantly changed from prior exam.  The
 aorta is tortuous and calcified. Biapical scarring is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia, with a small right
 pleural effusion. 
 2.  Stable hyperinflation suggestive of underlying COPD.
 3.  Stable multiple thoracic vertebral body compression fractures.
