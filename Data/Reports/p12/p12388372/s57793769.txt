                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post aortic valve replacement,
 pre-discharge evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the preoperative
 chest examination of ___.  There existed already marked cardiac
 enlargement on the pre-operative chest examination with most prominent left
 ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly.  Left atrial contour was only
 mildly prominent on the lateral view but pulmonary vascular pattern
 demonstrate an upper zone redistribution indicative of mildly increased
 chronic pulmonary congestion.  On the present examination, the AP frontal view
 demonstrates the multiple metallic sternotomy wires in midline.  The heart
 shadow remains similar in size, but there is now a remaining postoperative
 obliteration of the diaphragmatic contour and some blunting of the posterior
 pleural sinuses bilaterally on the lateral view suggestive of some remaining
 bilateral pleural effusion postoperatively.  On the preoperative chest
 findings, these pleural densities were not seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on the frontal view but a degree of upper zone redistribution
 pattern remains.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Postoperative AP and lateral chest views demonstrate unchanged
 enlarged heart size, new left basal density compatible with left lower lobe
 atelectasis and some postoperative pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax and no
 evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates.
