                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ABPA and obstructive lung disease with worsening cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again extremely
 severe peripheral parenchymal scars and areas of fibrosis, accompanied by
 regions of pleural thickening, although these are essentially unchanged in
 extent and severity.  No definite change, though a superimposed consolidation
 would be extremely difficult to identify given the underlying severe chronic
 lung disease.
