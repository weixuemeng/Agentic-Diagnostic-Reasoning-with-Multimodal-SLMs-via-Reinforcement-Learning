 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The known and pre-described massive bilateral mostly peripheral
 parenchymal scars and areas of fibrosis, accompanied by areas of pleural
 thickening are unchanged in extent and severity.  The changes are best
 documented on a CT examination from ___.  No new parenchymal
 opacities have appeared.  Neither the frontal nor the lateral radiograph show
 evidence of pleural effusions, but basal pleural thickening is present.  No
 pneumothorax.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
