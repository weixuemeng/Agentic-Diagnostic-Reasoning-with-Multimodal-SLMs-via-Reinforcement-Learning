 Mild interstitial abnormality has developed in the lower lungs, probably
 edema, even though the upper lungs are clear, the heart is normal size,
 pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are unremarkable, and there is no
 pleural effusion. It is not clear from the report of the ___ chest
 radiograph was there was concern for a lung nodule.  I do not see a nodule on
 this pair of chest radiographs, but chest CT scanning would be definitive if
 that is the clinical concern.
