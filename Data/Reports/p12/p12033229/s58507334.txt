                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hyponatremia.  Question mass or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Calcification is visible along the arch.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  In
 addition to vague increased asymmetry of interstitial markings in the left mid
 to lower lung, as depicted on the frontal view, there is focal opacity
 projecting along the lower lungs on the lateral view which also likely refers
 to the left, specifically the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric opacities in the left lower lobe which may be infectious.  No
 findings suggestive of congestive heart failure.  Follow-up radiographs are
 suggested to reassess when clinically appropriate.
