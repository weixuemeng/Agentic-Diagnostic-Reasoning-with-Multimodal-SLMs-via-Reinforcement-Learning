                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia and bacteremia, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The vascular structures are
 minimally enlarged, reflecting mild fluid overload.  There is atelectasis at
 both the left and the right lung bases, but no evidence of pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.  A slightly enlarged azygos vein reflects the mild fluid
 overload and should receive attention on followup exams.
