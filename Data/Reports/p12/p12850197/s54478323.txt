                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Interval
 decreased distention of azygous vein, which may reflect improved volume status
 of the patient.  Patchy opacities are present in the retrocardiac region
 bilaterally, and note is also made of peribronchial cuffing.  Although
 nonspecific, aspiration should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to ensure resolution.
