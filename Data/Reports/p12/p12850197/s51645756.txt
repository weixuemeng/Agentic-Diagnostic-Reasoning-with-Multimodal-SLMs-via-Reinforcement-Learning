                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for abscess.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bases of both lungs are
 better ventilated.  However, minimal areas of atelectasis persist at both the
 left and the right lung bases.  More obvious than on the previous image is a
 mediastinal contour abnormality at the level of the azygos vein.  This contour
 is only partly explained by the azygos vein, although contour could also
 represent a slightly tortuous ascending aorta, a further clarification with CT
 should be performed.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 Postoperative changes in the right shoulder.
