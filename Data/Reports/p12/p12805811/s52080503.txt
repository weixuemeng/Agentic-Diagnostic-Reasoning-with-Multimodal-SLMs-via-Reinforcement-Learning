                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and peritonitis in a patient on peritoneal dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 performed 16 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Unchanged bibasilar linear opacities are more prominent on the
 left than on the right and are likely aatelectasis.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Free intraperitoneal air has increased and is expected in a
 peritoneal dialysis patient.  Prominence of air filled small bowel loops in
 the upper abdomen could represent ileus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged bibasilar linear opacities are likely atelectasis.
 2.  Prominence of air filled small bowel loops in the upper abdomen could
 represent ileus.
