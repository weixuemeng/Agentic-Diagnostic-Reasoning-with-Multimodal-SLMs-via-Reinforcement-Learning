 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:43 PM
  Decreased left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax appreciated.  Persistent
  right pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity and pulmonary edema are similar
  to prior.  Unchanged position of intra-aortic balloon pump located 7 mm low
  the apex of the aortic arch.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip remains in the left
  pulmonary artery.  Left central venous catheter terminates in the right
  atrium.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump terminates about 7 mm below
 the superior aspect of the aortic knob, and a Swan-Ganz catheter terminates
 within the descending left pulmonary artery.  These findings have been
 communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 9 a.m. on ___ at the
 time of discovery.  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The rapid
 improvement of the left perihilar  opacity favors pulmonary edema.  Residual
 asymmetrically distributed perihilar opacities may reflect asymmetrical edema,
 although superimposed process such as pneumonia in the right lung is also
 possible.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is unchanged, but a small
 left pleural effusion has decreased.
