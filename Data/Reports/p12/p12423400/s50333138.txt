                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary fibrosis, recent COPD exacerbation
 with tenderness to the right side and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest correlated to images from
 PET-CT from ___.  Slightly increased interstitial markings within
 the lungs compatible with patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis, not
 significantly changed from prior CT scan.  There is no evidence of
 consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Osseous structures are notable for shortening of the right clavicle
 with an incompletely visualized and likely widened acromioclavicular distance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of patient's known pulmonary fibrosis without definite
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
