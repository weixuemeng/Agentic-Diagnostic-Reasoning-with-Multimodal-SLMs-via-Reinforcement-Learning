  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  Possible minimally displaced fracture
  through the lateral aspect of the left 5th rib.  For further evaluation,
  recommend obtaining a dedicated rib series with appropriately positioned skin
  markers.  Incompletely imaged proximal left humeral fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with known left humeral fracture.  Evaluate for
 rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Left shoulder radiographs from ___.  ___
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The lungs are
 clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Marked dextroscoliosis of
 the thoracic spine is noted.  A contour irregularity along the lateral aspect
 of the left fifth rib could be a minimally displaced fracture, likely present
 on the prior study from ___.  There is redemonstration of a displaced
 fracture through the proximal aspect of the left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely old left fifth rib fracture, probably present on the prior
 radiographs from ___.  No definite new displaced rib fracture.
