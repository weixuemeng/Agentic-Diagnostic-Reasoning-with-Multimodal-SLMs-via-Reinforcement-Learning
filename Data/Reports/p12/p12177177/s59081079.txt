                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, recent pericardial
 effusion, bilateral lower lung field faint crackles.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated.  The left lower lung field is
 opacified as it was in the prior exam, with a distinct linear consolidation
 tracking across the left lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis with a
 concurrent small pleural effusion.  Otherwise, the remaining lung fields are
 clear.  Cardiac sillhouette appears slightly smaller suggesting improvement of
 the pericardial effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiac sillhouette slightly less enlarged.
 2.  Left lung base atelectases with a concurrent small pleural effusion does
 not appear significantly changed compared with prior exam.
