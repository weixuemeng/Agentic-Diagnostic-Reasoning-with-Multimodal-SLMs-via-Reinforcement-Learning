 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but decreased compared to the prior exam. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are notable for mild tortuosity of thoracic
 aorta.  Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aorta. 
 Lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present. 
 Nonaggressive sclerotic focus within the left proximal humerus likely reflects
 a bone island.
