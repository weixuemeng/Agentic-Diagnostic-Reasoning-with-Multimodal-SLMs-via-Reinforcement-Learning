                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hip fracture.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ and CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal supine views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung volumes
 results in bronchovascular crowding, but a small right pleural effusion is
 larger than on ___, pulmonary vasculature less distinct, there are
 new septal lines due to increased  interstitial pulmonary edema.  The heart is
 enlarged, similar to ___.  A fractured uppermost median sternotomy
 wire is unchanged.
 
 A tubular opacity still present at the lower pole of the right hilus could be
 a vessel or a nodule. Repeat conventional chest radiographs should be taken
 after resolution of cardiac decompensation to see if Chest CT is neeeded for
 clarification.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. Need to follow possible right lower lobe
 lung nodule.
