                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness and elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Fractured
 superior most wire is again seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged.  Small right-sided pleural
 effusion is again seen, which is likely chronic.  Overlying right base opacity
 may be due to overlying atelectasis, but is concerning for pneumonia given the
 clinical scenario.  Left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural effusion. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Again seen small right pleural effusion, which may be chronic. 
 Overlying right base opacity pneumonia vs atelectasis; given clinical
 scenario, pneumonia is of concern.
 
 Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
