                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // please evaluate for acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes
 are low which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base laterally
 is increased compared to the previous examination, and a tiny left pleural
 effusion may be present.  There is no large pleural effusion on the right or
 evidence for focal consolidation.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lateral lung base patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes, however infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  A trace left pleural effusion may be present.
