 please eval effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pleural basilar pigtail catheter remains in place.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity with an
 associated layering effusion likely reflecting lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Faint opacity at the right base
 appears somewhat improved suggestive of resolving atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable cardiac enlargement.
