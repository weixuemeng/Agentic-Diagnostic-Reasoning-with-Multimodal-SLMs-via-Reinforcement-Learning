 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 atelectasis. The left lung is clear. There is no definite left pleural
 effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is difficult to compare to the prior
