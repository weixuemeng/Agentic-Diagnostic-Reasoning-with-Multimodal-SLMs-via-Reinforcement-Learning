                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent right pleural effusion/heptothorax
 // Please assess for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior chest radiograph from 1 day earlier, a right pleural
 catheter is present with a persistent moderate to large right pleural effusion
 which likely has a substantial subpulmonic component. Overall, the pleural
 effusion is not appreciably changed but positional and projectional
 differences limit COMPARISON.  It ___ atelectasis persists in the right
 middle and right lower lobes. The left lung is grossly clear except for minor
 atelectasis at the left base.
