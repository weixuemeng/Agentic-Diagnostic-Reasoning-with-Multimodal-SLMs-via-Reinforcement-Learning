                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval development of white out of the right hemithorax is likely due to a
 large right pleural effusion which is increased substantially since the prior
 study. The heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large
 right pleural effusion. No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. The left
 lung is clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormality is present. Mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion has increased substantially now resulting in
 white out of the right hemithorax.
