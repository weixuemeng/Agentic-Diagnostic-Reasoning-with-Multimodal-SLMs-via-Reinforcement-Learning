 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Left subclavian central venous
 line again terminates deep in the right atrium.  Right pleural effusion
 adjacent atelectasis is minimally improved, however this may be secondary to
 patient positioning.  Small left pleural effusion is again seen.  Heart size
 is unchanged and retrocardiac atelectasis is similar.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is similar to yesterday's radiograph.

 Unchanged right apical pneumothorax, bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.
