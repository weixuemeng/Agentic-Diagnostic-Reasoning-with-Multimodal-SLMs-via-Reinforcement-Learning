 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent chest tube placement now with
 hemoptysis.  // Eval interval change of effusion, explanation for hemoptysis. 
 Eval interval change of effusion, explanation for hemoptysis
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Decreased moderate right pleural effusion following pigtail catheter drainage.
 Right lung airspace opacities may be due to pulmonary hemorrhage or edema.
 
 
 A CT scan would be helpful in determining whether there is a central mass and
 to assess airway patency, and should be done with intravenous contrast.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 A CT scan would be helpful in determining whether there is a central mass and
 to assess airway patency, and should be done with intravenous contrast.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Following pigtail catheter drainage, there is improved aeration of the right
 lung with persistent partial opacification secondary to a decreased moderate
 pleural effusion. Diffuse right lung airspace opacities are now visible. The
 left lung remains clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 cannot be accurately assessed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
