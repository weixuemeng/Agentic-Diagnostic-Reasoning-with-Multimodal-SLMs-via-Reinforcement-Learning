                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/chest tightness, please eval for pna  // ___F w/chest
 tightness, please eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild blunting of posterior costophrenic angles
 could represent trace effusions.  Vague opacity projecting over the left
 anterior fourth rib is most suggestive callus formation from prior rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
