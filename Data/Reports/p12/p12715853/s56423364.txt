                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and dysnpea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky opacity
 in the right upper lobe suggests minor atelectasis.  There are vague focus of
 increased density where the seventh and ninth ribs intersect and also
 projecting over the right lower lung.  A nearby increased density projects
 over the right anterior right seventh rib.  These findings are new.  There are
 no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Lower thoracic interspaces are
 moderately narrowed, similar to increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New densities projecting over the right lower lung and over rib shadows; these
 may be healed ribs although one may represent a nipple shadow.  To examine for
 a potential pulmonary nodule, initial further evaluation with oblique
 radiographs is recommended when clinically appropriate.
