                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p robotic prostatectomy 4 days ago, no flatus or
 BM since. Pt's abdomen distended, severe hiccoughs.  // Please assess for
 ileus, as well as aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left base opacity is seen which is felt to more likely represent atelectasis
 rather than pneumonia.  Aspiration is not entirely excluded.  There are low
 lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Gaseous distention of bowel is
 partially imaged.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis
