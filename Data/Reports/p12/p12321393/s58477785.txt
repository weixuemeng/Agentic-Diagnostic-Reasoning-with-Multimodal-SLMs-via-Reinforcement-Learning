                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, recent pneumonia and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a right upper and lower lobe
 consolidation.  Since the prior radiograph, there is increased lucency within
 the right upper lobe consolidation, concerning for cavitation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 No definite pleural effusions are present.  The patient has nipple rings in
 place.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent consolidation in the right upper and lower lobe with
 concern for cavitation in the RUL. Consider CT to further assess given the
 apparent worsening despite treatment. 
 
 These findings were discussed with the ___ resident ___ MD via
 telephone at 5:30 pm on ___.
