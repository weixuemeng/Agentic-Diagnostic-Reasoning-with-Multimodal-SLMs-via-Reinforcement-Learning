                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are multifocal opacities seen in the right lung within the
 upper and lower lobes and likely within the middle lobe as well.  There is
 also subtle opacity in the left mid lung.  Costophrenic angles are sharp.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Nipple rings are seen
 bilaterally.  The soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable as are the osseous
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal airspace disease in the right lung and potentially in
 the left as well.  In the proper clinical setting this could represent
 multifocal pneumonia.
