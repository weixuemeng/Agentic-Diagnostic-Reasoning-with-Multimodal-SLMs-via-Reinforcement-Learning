                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia, abscesses, new acute chest pain, please
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates decreased right upper
 lobe opacifications as well as decreased central lucent cavity.  However,
 there has been interval increase in size of the right middle lobe
 opacification with greater lateral expansion of consolidation and with a
 greater area of central lucency.  No pneumothorax evident.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle likely represents a new small pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving right upper lobe process; however, increased right
 middle lobe process with a greater area of opacification as well as central
 lucency as well as some new small right pleural effusion.  Given multiple
 cavitating lung lesions consider immunosupression possibly from HIV vs
 valvular abnormality.
