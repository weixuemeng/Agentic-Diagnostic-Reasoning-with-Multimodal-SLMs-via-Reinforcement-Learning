                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left subclavian line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left subclavian central venous catheter appears to be malpositioned with the
 tip not crossing midline, projecting over the region of the carina, likely
 arterial in location.  There is no pneumothorax.Low lung volumes are present. 
 Heart size is difficult to assess but is likely mildly enlarged.  Aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is crowding of bronchovascular
 structures and prominence of the hila bilaterally.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.  Right
 hemidiaphragm appears mildly elevated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left subclavian central venous catheter appears malpositioned, likely
 intra-arterial.  
 
 This finding was initially discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at
 8:13PM, ___ and Dr. ___ ___ at 10:00 PM, ___.
 
 2. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
