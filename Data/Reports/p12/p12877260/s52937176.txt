                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bronchiectasis, presenting with throat soreness. 
 Evaluate for acute illness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___. 
 CT torso from ___.  Of note, patient also has a known history of
 CLL.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 right Port-A-Cath ends near the superior cavoatrial junction.  There is
 re-demonstration of bilateral lower lung bronchiectasis.  Previously seen
 concomitant reticular right lower lung opacities on the prior radiograph from
 ___ have decreased, consistent with interval resolution of an
 inflammatory/infectious process.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was better appreciated on the prior CT torso from
 ___.  The descending thoracic aorta is unfolded.  Aortic
 calcifications are seen.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Multilevel flowing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament
 is consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, not significantly
 changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Interval resolution of right lower lung infectious/inflammatory process
 compared to prior radiographs from ___.
