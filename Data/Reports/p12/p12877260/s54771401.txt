 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CLL, chronic bronchiectasis, saturations, evaluation for
 pneumonia or pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are increased areas
 of combined opacities and consolidations in both lower lobes, changes are
 bilateral but more severe on the right than on the left.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, changes are likely to reflect pneumonia.  There is
 associated volume loss in the middle lobe and mild hyperinflation of the upper
 lobes.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
