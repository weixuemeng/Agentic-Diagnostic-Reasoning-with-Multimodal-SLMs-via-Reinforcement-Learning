                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, chronic cough and high white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and coarse interstitial
 markings.  Vague suggestion of some increased opacification at the left base
 medially.  This most likely represents atelectatic change, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 Central catheter remains in place.
