                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia,
 increasing cough, assess for abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  As shown on previous chest examination, pulmonary
 vasculature with increased basal translucency coinciding with low positioned
 and flattened diaphragms is consistent with chronic COPD.  Comparison with the
 next preceding study, there are two thin peripheral plate atelectasis on the
 right base which were not present to the same extent on the previous
 examination.  No other acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.  No
 pneumothorax has developed.  Previously described right-sided Port-A-Cath
 system introduced via the right internal jugular vein approach remains in
 unchanged position terminating in the lower SVC.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rather advanced COPD as before, thin plate atelectasis on right
 base but no new acute infiltrates.  No pneumothorax.
