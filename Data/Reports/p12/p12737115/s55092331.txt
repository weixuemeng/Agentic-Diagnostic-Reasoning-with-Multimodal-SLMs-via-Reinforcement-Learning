 INDICATION:  Cough, please evaluate for pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Heart size is normal.  Faint rounded opacity
 is identified projecting over the left lateral border of the heart may
 represents nipple shadow.  However, there appears to be a somewhat nodular
 density in the breast on the lateral views which appears deep to the nipple. 
 No opacification concerning for pneumonia identified.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.  No osseous abnormality identified, though multilevel
 degenerative changes are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular density projecting over the left lateral border the heart
 of unclear etiology may correspond with a nodular density that appears deep to
 the nipple within the left breast on lateral view.  While finding could relate
 to the nipple, there may be a density deeper to it.  Please correlate with
 mammography.  Mammogram from ___ does not demonstrate a nodular density in
 the left breast.
