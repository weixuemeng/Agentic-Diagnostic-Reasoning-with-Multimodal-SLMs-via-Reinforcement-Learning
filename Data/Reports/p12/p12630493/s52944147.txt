                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta demonstrates
 mild tortuosity and calcifications at the aortic knob.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities persist, with continued bronchial wall thickening noted
 diffusely.  No new areas of consolidation are present.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar appearance of the chest with bibasilar patchy airspace opacities and
 diffuse bronchial wall thickening suggestive of diffuse bronchiolitis and
 possible aspiration or infection at the lung bases.
