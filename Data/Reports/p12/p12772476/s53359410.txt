 There is extensive scoliosis.  There is residual contrast material seen within
 the colon.  There are lucencies projecting over the left retrocardiac area,
 which likely represents a hiatal hernia.  There is atelectasis at the left
 lung base and possibly a small pleural effusion bilaterally with blunting of
 the costophrenic angles.  The mid and upper lung zones of both lungs are
 clear.  There is calcification in thoracic aorta with some deviation of the
 trachea to the right side.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  There are no signs
 for overt pulmonary edema.
