 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p rollover MVC car vs. tree, ejected; garbled speech and
 not moving lower extremities, intubated on scene; C6-7 fracture-dislocation 
 s/p ant (___)/ post (___)fixation , 12cm head lac, ?small SAH  // interval
 assessment    interval assessment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is slightly off midline, unchanged.  No mediastinal widening
 or pneumomediastinum.  Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  Moderate to
 severe cardiac enlargement is unchanged.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
