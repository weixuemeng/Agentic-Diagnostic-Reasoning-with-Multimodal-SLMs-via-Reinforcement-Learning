 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:12 PM
  Since the most recent study, worsening opacity at the right lung base, likely
  representing combination of effusion and atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and
  hilar contours are stable.   Left PICC with tip in the proximal SVC. 
  Tracheostomy in expected position.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the previous study obtained and ___ at 10:02 there has been
 slight interval progression in the right lung base opacity most likely
 representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The minimal

 Tracheostomy is in place.  Left subclavian line tip terminates at the level of
 superior mid SVC.  Spinal hardware is partially imaged.  No pneumothorax
