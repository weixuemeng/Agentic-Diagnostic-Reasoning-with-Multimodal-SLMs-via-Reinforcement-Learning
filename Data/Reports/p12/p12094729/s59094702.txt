                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:48 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old with an NG tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Feeding tube has been withdrawn to the upper esophagus or airway on the first
 of three images obtained, ultimately ending in the very upper stomach where
 one of the more proximal side ports could still be in the lower esophagus. 
 Clinical correlation is essential.  Large bilateral pleural effusions and
 previous moderate pulmonary edema have improved.  Left lower lobe is still
 collapsed.  Heart size is unchanged but difficult to assess, not grossly
 dilated.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
