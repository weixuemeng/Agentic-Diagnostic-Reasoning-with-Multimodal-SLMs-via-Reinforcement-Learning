 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  Heart size is top
 normal.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 distended gas-filled loops of apparent large bowel in the upper abdomen
 incompletely imaged on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Distended gas-filled loops of large bowel in the upper abdomen could
 reflect ileus or obstruction.  Consider dedicated radiographs of the abdomen
 for further evaluation.
