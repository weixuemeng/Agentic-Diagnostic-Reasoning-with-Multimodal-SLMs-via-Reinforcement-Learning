                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sudden shortness of breath, tachycardia, assess for acute
 abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low, though allowing for this, the lungs appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears grossly stable with top normal heart size, possibly
 magnified due to portable AP technique.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  If there is strong concern for
 PE, recommend CT to further assess.
