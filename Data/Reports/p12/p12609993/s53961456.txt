                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coughing, syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy and linear opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
