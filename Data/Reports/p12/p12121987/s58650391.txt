                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with bilateral lower extremity edema.  Assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are present with adjacent areas of atelectasis. 
 Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to adjacent opacities.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Apparent perihilar
 vascular congestion is also seen.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent areas of opacity probably
 attributable to compressive atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema.
