                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chills.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Exam is somewhat limited due to
 poor inspiratory effort and patient body habitus.  The lungs are clear of
 large confluent consolidation or effusion.  There is no definite pulmonary
 vascular congestion; however, there is crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings which could be due to poor inspiratory effort.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this limited
 exam as detailed above.
