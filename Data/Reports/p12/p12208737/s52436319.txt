                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion; also stage III non-small lungs small cell lung
 cancer with prior chemoradiation therapy
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; a Chest CT is also available
 from ___, from the prior day.
  
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is similar widespread opacification involving primarily the right upper
 lobe.  The distribution is quite similar to the prior radiographs, although
 with decreased density in some areas.  There is no definite evidence for a
 superimposed process, allowing for differences in technique, although the
 morphology of associated atelectatic changes in the right upper lobe have
 waxed and waned somewhat in distribution.  Volume loss is again noted in the
 right hemithorax.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar widespread opacification of the right upper lung which
 can likely be attributed to treatment effect, although a subtle superimposed
 infectious process is difficult to completely exclude.
