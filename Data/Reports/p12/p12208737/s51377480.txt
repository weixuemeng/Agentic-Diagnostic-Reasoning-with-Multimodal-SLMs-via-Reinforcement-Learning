                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bloody output from pleural tube.  History of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  The right
 hilar contour has decreased in extent, with near resolution of the right-sided
 pleural effusion.  There is probably still a loculated component of pleural
 effusion along the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe and probably
 parenchymal opacity, but minimal.  The left lung remains clear.  There is no
 definite pneumothorax.  Regarding positioning of a right-sided pleural tube,
 on the frontal view, it terminates in the right upper posterior chest, very
 similar to the prior examination.  Thoracic compression deformities appear
 unchanged.  These include a moderate-to-severe mid thoracic wedge compression
 deformity.  Post-surgical changes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial decrease in right-sided pleural effusion and
 otherwise unchanged post-treatment appearance of the chest.
