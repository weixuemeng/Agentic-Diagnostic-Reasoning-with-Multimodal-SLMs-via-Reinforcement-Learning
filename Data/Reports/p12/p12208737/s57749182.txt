                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of stage III non-small
 cell lung cancer, pleural effusion seen in MRI, assess for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  The previously described parenchymal mass
 occupying the right upper lobe lateral area persists.  It has not undergone
 any significant change in size during the latest examination interval.  Noted
 on the frontal view is an increased pleural effusion which now blunts the
 right lateral pleural sinus and obliterates the contours of the diaphragm
 completely.  The effusion reaches posteriorly at the mid portion of the right
 posterior chest wall.  The left hemithorax remains clear, and no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen there.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing pleural effusion on the right side matching the
 described pleural density seen on MRI examination of ___.  Location
 of the pleural effusion is somewhat different related to the fact that MR
 examination is performed in the supine position, whereas the chest examination
 is performed with patient in upright position.
