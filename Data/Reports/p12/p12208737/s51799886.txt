 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post thoracentesis; assess for pneumothorax and
 residual pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier.
 
 Loculated right pleural effusion has decreased in size.  There is persistent
 loss of volume in the right lower lobe with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right perihilar
 post-radiation changes and right upper lobe opacities are unchanged.
