 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  History of non-small cell lung
 cancer with recent chest CT with moderate effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___ and CT chest from ___.  Again seen is a
 right-sided pleural effusion which is not significantly changed in size, which
 is partially loculated posteriorly seen on the lateral view.  Opacity in the
 right mid lung is compatible post-irradiation changes, but better
 characterized by prior CT.  The left lung remains clear.  Trace left-sided
 effusion is seen.  The left lung remains clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged noting
 multiple thoracic compression deformities, not definitely changed from CT
 scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Right pleural effusion and
 post-treatment changes in the right mid lung, unchanged from prior.
