                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  AVR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement and mediastinal venous distention have both
 improved since ___.  Bibasilar opacification is, statistically, most
 likely atelectasis, but pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe, looks
 similar.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Moderate postoperative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 stable.
