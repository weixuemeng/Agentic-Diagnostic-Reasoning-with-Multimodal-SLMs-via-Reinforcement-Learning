                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-ERCP, pancreatitis, questionable pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 constant.  Constant size of the cardiac silhouette and marked constant
 appearance of the lung parenchyma.  On today's examination, a small
 retrocardiac atelectasis has newly appeared.  There is minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting a small left pleural effusion.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
