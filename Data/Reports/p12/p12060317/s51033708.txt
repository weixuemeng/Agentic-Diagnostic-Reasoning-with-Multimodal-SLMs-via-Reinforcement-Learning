 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sudden onset SOB and hypoxia  // evaluate
 for CHF or PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a large
 right pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.  The right upper lung as well as the left hemi thorax are completely
 normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Known hilar lymph node
 calcifications on the right. The position of the Port-A-Cath is unchanged. To
 clarify the precise location of the opacity, they frontal and lateral view
 should be acquired at the next radiographic followup.
