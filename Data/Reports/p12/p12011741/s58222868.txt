                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  *** CODE CORD *** History: ___M with elevated lactate, lethargy. 
 // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is no definite focal airspace opacity to suggest
 pneumonia.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect pericardial fat pads.  The
 heart is exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes but likely larger
 since the prior study now with mild to moderate cardiomegaly. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Heart size is larger with mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
