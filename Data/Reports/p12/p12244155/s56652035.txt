 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Pacemaker leads terminate supposedly
 in right atrium and right ventricle. Of note is that the position of the right
 ventricular (supposedly) lead is projected posteriorly.  Alternatively it
 might represent right atrial lead.  Please correlate with the output of the
 pacemakers.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is
 better appreciated on the lateral view.  Lungs are clear.
