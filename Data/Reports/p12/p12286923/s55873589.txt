                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of right chest pain and
 shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  A 6-mm
 rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base on the frontal view and
 lower spine/posterior lung base on the lateral view may represent a calcified
 granuloma.  A chest CT is pending to rule out pulmonary embolism and this can
 be further evaluated on that study.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  6-mm rounded nodular density projecting over the posterior right lung base
 may represent a calcified granuloma and can be further evaluated on the
 pending chest CT.
