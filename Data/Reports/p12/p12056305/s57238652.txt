                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new stroke, evaluate for nodules.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is cardiomegaly.  The enlargement appears to involve mostly
 the left ventricle which is prominent to the left and posteriorly.  Thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened but markedly elongated and shows some calcium
 deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 presently not congested.  There exists some prominence of the central
 pulmonary artery, the hilar regions, but the periphery does not show
 perivascular haze nor is there evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema. 
 The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free, excluding significant
 pleural effusion.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates are identified.
 
 Comparison can be made with the frontal view of a preceding chest examination,
 outside institution.  On this image, poor inspirational effort resultant in
 crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature.  It is conceivable that one
 may have interpreted this to include multiple nodular densities but this
 cannot be confirmed by today's chest examination with improved inspirational
 effort.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, thoracic aortic elongation in patient with history
 of stroke.  No signs of acute CHF or acute infiltrates.
