                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is again a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads
 terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta. 
 Similar to prior findings, there is upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
 vasculature and peribronchial cuffing suggesting a state of very mild vascular
 congestion.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There has
 been little if any change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
