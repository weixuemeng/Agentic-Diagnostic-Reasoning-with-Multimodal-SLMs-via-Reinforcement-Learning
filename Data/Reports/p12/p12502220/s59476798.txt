                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with septic shock
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC, unchanged.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval.
 Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified though
 assessment of both lung apices is slightly limited due to overlying soft
 tissues from the neck and chin obscuring these regions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval with retrocardiac
 opacity, likely atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
