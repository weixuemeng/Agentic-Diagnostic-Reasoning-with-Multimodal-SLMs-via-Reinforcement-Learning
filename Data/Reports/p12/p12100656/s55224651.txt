                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? pneumonia given copious secretions  //
 interval change in infiltrate LLL
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There
 is a focal area of parenchymal opacity at the right lung base, likely
 reflecting atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded.  An area
 of consolidated lung in the retrocardiac lung region is not substantially
 changed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural effusion.  The
 monitoring and support devices are constant.
