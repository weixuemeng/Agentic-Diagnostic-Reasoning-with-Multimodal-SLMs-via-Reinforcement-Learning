                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with STEMI and high risk lesion, new luekocytosis
 // r/o pulm edema, pna, cardiomegaly      r/o pulm edema, pna, cardiomegaly
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, side the patient has taken
 a better inspiration and there is little change in the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. There is some indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels raising the
 possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. More coalescent
 opacification at the bases, especially on the left, could reflect merely
 atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
