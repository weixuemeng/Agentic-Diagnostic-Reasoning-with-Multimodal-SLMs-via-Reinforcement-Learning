                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Right lower lobe opacity has resolved consistent with
 resolved pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. 
 Blunting of the lateral right CP angle is likely pleural thickening.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.
