                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension and unstable gait.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated. Slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may
 be due to trace pleural efffusions.  Evidence of a hiatal hernia is again
 seen.  Left base linear streaky opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette
 top normal to mildly enlarged and the aorta calcified and tortuous.  Right
 paratracheal density is again seen, most likely due to vascular structures and
 is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
