                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD, cough, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Prominence of the interstitial markings suggests
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is some calcification
 along the aorta.  Right paratracheal opacity without deviation of the trachea
 is similar to prior and likely relates to vascular structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema suggest CHF.
 Bibasilar opacities likely relate to pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
