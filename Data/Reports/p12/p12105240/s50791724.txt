                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for patient
 rotation.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema
 are new.  Moderate partially layering right pleural effusion and small left
 pleural effusion have increased in size, and are accompanied by adjacent
 basilar lung opacities, which likely represent atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, aspiration and infectious pneumonia could
 produce similar appearance at the lung bases.  Short-term followup radiographs
 may be helpful in this regard.
