                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachypnea, shortness of breath, and
 wheezing.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature markings are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis or
 infection.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a
 small to moderate sized pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with right base opacity, compatible with
 atelectasis but early infection cannot be excluded.  Small-to-moderate sized
 right pleural effusion.
