 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly appears increased in size from the previous study.  There is
 upper zone vascular redistribution without overt edema suggesting elevated

 No focal consolidation, pleural or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities detected in the thoracic spine.
