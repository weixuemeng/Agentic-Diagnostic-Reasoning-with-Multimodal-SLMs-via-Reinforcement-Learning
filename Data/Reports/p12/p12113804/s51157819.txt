                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD, atrial fibrillation,
 presents with shortness of breath and new leukocytosis.  Patient's condition
 required examination in sitting upright position using AP single view
 technique.  Comparison is made with a similar preceding study of ___.  Heart size undetermined; however, some moderate cardiac enlargement is
 likely to be present.  Pulmonary vasculature again shows a congestive pattern
 with perivascular haze and blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus
 indicates presence of pleural effusion that obscures the diaphragmatic
 contour.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates
 in comparison with the next preceding study of ___ where the
 pulmonary congestive pattern was more marked.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion with right-sided pleural effusion,
 somewhat improving over the last two days.  No evidence of new infiltrates.
