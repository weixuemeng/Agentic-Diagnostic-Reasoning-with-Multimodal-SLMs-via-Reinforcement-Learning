                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with AFib and RVR this morning, new
 crackles.  Question flash pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: Bilateral pulmonary opacities are slightly worsening consistent with
 atelectasis and increasing effusions, particularly on the right.  Left-sided
 opacity projecting over the eighth posterior rib is again present but has no
 correlate to the recent chest CT.  As previously postulated, this may be
 overlying skin lesion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema or opacities
 concerning for an infectious process.
