                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are hyperinflated.  A vague rounded opacity in the right base
 is consistent with a nipple shadow.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct,
 compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion.  No overt pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion is noted.  No focal pulmonary consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 The heart size is normal.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without effusion.
 2.  Rounded opacity in the right lung base is likely a nipple shadow, but
 follow-up radiograph with nipple markers may be obtained for confirmation
 after diuresis.
