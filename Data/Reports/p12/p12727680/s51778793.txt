  Compared with the prior study, lung volumes are lower, causing accentuation of
  the heart size and mild bronchovascular crowding.  Left basilar opacity is
  likely due to combination of atelectasis and effusion.  No pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cp  // r/o acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, low lung volumes accentuate the
 cardiac silhouette and result in crowding of bronchovascular structures. 
 Linear bibasilar atelectasis is present as well as a possible small left
 pleural effusion.  No other relevant change since recent study.
