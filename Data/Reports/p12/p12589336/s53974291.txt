 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:53 PM
  
  1. Large opacity occupying much of the medial right upper lung is overall
  smaller in comparison to chest x-ray from ___, however there is still
  a substantial suprahilar component measuring at least 7.3 x 6.0 cm on the
  current radiograph.  There is improved aeration of the right upper lobe status
  post tumor debridement.
  2. Peripheral interlobular septal thickening is suggestive of some degree of
  pulmonary vascular congestion.  No frank pulmonary edema.
  3. The remainder the right lung is clear.  The left lung is clear.  There is
  no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are
  stable.
  C.  Hostage ___ at 22:51.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RUL tumor debrided, rule out ptx  // rule
 out ptx      rule out ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The apparent decrease in size of the right hilar mass is probably due to 
 partial re-expansion of the previously collapsed right upper lobe following
 endobronchial therapy.  It is conceivable that the mass itself may have
 decreased if the patient has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation.
 
 New small linear opacities in the left mid lung could be due to transient
 edema or atelectasis.  Disseminated tumor is less likely given the absence of
 such finding on the chest CT ___.
 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size top-normal.
