  1. A right IJ central venous catheter is in grossly appropriate position
  projecting over the approximate location of the mid SVC.
  2. Again seen is complete opacification of the right hemi thorax, compatible
  with a large right pleural effusion with near-complete collapse of the right
  lung.  There is no shift of mediastinal structures, as on prior.
  3. The left lung is stable in appearance, appearing well-aerated without focal
  consolidation.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hemi thorax is uniformly opacified by a collapsed right lung and some,
 probably significant volume of pleural effusion.  Poor definition of the right

 occlusion.
 
 Left lung clear.  Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  No left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax
