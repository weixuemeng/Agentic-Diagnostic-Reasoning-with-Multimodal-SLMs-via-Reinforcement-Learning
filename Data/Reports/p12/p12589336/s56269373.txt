                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R VATS, pleurx placement, PTX  // Interval
 change      Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 18:11.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basal PleurX catheter is difficult to see, probably unchanged since the
 earlier examination, accounting for the apparent decrease in right
 pneumothorax.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Large right upper
 lobe mass and right basal atelectasis persist.
 
 New heterogeneous opacification at the left lung base is probably atelectasis,
 but should be followed.  Moderate cardiomegaly has worsened.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements.  A
 nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
