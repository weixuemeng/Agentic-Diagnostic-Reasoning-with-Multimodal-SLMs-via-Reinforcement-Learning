                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSCLC and carcinomatosis, presenting with
 resp distress.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:24
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Right IJ central line in place, probably similar in position, though the right
 heart border is now completely obscured.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been significant increased opacification
 of the right lung.  The right lung apex is now opacified and there is
 increased opacification at the right lung base. Previously seen opacity in the
 right lung is now denser.  If a small residual pneumothorax is present, it is
 difficult to discern on the current film. The right basal pleural drain is
 again noted, best seen on the edge-enhanced image.
 
 The right mainstem bronchus is truncated immediately beyond the carina. 
 Possible slight rightward shift of the trachea and mediastinum, but no gross
 rightward shift of the mediastinum is suggested.
 
 On the left, there is mild upper zone redistribution and atelectasis at the
 left lung base, similar to the prior study.  On the left, no new infiltrate or
 consolidation and no gross effusion.  No overt CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the right lung, which has progressed over multiple
 films.  Since the most recent prior film, the right apex and right base are
 now almost completely opacified and the central opacity is denser.  Possible
 interval mild rightward shift of the mediastinum.  The etiology is uncertain,
 but this could reflect accumulating pleural fluid versus progressive lung
 collapse.  If clinically indicated, CT could help to more completely
 characterize the findings in the right lung.
 
 On the left, mild upper zone redistribution and basilar atelectasis again
 noted, similar to the prior film, but the left lung remains otherwise grossly
 clear.
