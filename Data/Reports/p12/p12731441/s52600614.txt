                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypertension, status post Roux-En-Y gastric bypass,
 worsening and elevated inflammatory makers.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no evidence of pneumonia,
 CHF, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate degenerative changes are in
 the thoracic spine.  A tiny dense nodular opacity projecting over the anterior
 right second rib could be a calcified granuloma or a bone island.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
