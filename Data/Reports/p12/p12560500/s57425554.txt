 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 with intermittent hypoxia  // eval for pulmonary edema, consolidation, etc... 
 eval for pulmonary edema, consolidation, etc...
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 21:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 00:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided large bore hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position.  The
 widened mediastinal contours persist, although there now appears to be
 increased right paratracheal soft tissue which raises concern for
 lymphadenopathy or possibly could represent distended venous structures due to
 a fluid replete state.  The heart remains enlarged.  There is prominent
 calcification of the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis.  Low lung
 volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect aspiration, atelectasis,
 or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
