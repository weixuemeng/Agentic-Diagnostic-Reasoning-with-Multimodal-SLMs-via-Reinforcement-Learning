                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with NSTEMI, increased work of breathing. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, earlier on the same day at
 1207h.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with
 background chronic pulmonary disease.  Interstitial edema is mild.  Central
 pulmonary vascular congestion is also mild.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 given the hyperexpanded lungs.  Blunting of the left greater than right
 costophrenic angle suggests probable trace pleural effusions.  Tiny amount of
 fluid tracks in the minor fissure.  No definite focal consolidation. No
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Aortic knob calcifications are
 mild.  Slight asymmetric opacity along the left lateral mid hemi thorax just
 below the tip of the scapula persists and may reflect a developing pneumonia
 (was previously obscured by external ventillation device).  No acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild edema and trace effusions on a background of chronic pulmonary
 disease.
 2.  Focal consolidation in the left lateral mid lung is concerning for
 pneumonia.
