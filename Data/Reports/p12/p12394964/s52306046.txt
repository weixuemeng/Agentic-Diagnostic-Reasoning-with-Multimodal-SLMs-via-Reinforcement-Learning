                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bronchovascular markings remain prominent.  There is streaky density at the
 lung bases most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.  There is somewhat
 asymmetric density at the right lung base.  The cardiac silhouette is
 prominent but may be exaggerated by portable technique.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Mediastinal structures are stable.  The bony thorax is grossly
 intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable examination except for asymmetric density at the right lung base that
 may be due to some volume loss.  Focal consolidation cannot be excluded.  A
 lateral view may be helpful if further evaluation is clinically indicated.
