                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with CAD s/p stent in ___, HFpEF, DM COPd and
 chronic anemia with hypercarib resp failure ___ COPD exacerbation and acute
 renal failure now with R lung effusion and re-intubated, on CPAP now.  //
 ?interval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 2:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extends beneath diaphragm.  The sideport if present with lie
 above the GE junction.
 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is evidence of CHF, with upper zone
 redistribution, vascular plethora, interstitial edema and diffuse vascular
 blurring, unchanged.
 
 There is prominent opacity in the right lower zone,  unchanged.  This likely
 represents a combination of a pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density is unchanged.  However, the left pleural sulcus
 is better seen, suggesting decrease in size of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip lies beneath the diaphragm.  However, if there is a side-port, it
 may lie above the GE junction.
 
 Otherwise, essentially unchanged compared with ___ at 02:37.  The
 left costophrenic sulcus is now better seen
 .
 Cardiomegaly, CHF and bibasilar opacities, are similar to the prior study.
