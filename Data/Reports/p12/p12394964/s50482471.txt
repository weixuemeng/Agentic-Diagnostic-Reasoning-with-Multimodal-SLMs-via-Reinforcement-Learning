                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/worsening tachypnea/hypoxia  // interval changes, pulm
 edema, consolidations      interval changes, pulm edema, consolidations
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is a prominent skin fold
 overlying the left hemithorax.  On the right, there is a smaller area of
 lucency along the lateral aspect of the upper right lung.  This suggests the
 possibility of a pneumothorax, though there does appear to be small vessels
 passing beyond it, so that this could represent merely another skin fold.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing prominence of
 interstitial markings, suggesting worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to exclude given
 the extensive pulmonary changes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Repeat radiograph to determine whether there is truly a
 small right pneumothorax.
