                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female alcoholic dependent with diabetes, depression
 and CVA.  Foot pain, agitation, hyperglycemia and fever.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Relatively small region of peribronchial opacification at the right lung base
 in the setting of above baseline vascular engorgement is probably mild edema. 
 Radiographically one cannot exclude recent aspiration or even very early
 pneumonia, but mild heart failure is the most likely explanation, given that
 heart size though normal is larger than it was in ___.  There is no pleural
 effusion, however, and the upper lungs are really clear.
