 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and leukocytosis, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  An area of likely atelectatic opacity is seen at the medial bases of
 the right lung, it is unchanged in extent and severity.  The subtle
 atelectatic changes in the retrocardiac lung areas are better appreciated on
 the lateral radiograph on today's image, as compared to the prior.  There is
 no unequivocal new parenchymal opacity.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No lung masses or
 nodules.
