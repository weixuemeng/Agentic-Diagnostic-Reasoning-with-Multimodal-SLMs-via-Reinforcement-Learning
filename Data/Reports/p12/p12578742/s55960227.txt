 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:10 AM
  
  1. Re-demonstration of possible pneumoperitoneum, although a true upright
  radiograph could not be obtained. If this is of clinical concern, a left
  lateral decubitus abdominal film should be obtained, or cross-sectional
  imaging if that cannot be tolerated by the patient.
  2. Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar consolidations.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/f free air on initial CXR  // eval for free
 subdiaphragmatic air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi erect portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 03:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the right PICC is in a similar position, in the right brachiocephalic
 vein.  Lung volumes are extremely low, with bibasilar consolidations.  Small
 left pleural effusion is presumed.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.  The crescentic lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is re-
 demonstrated, and remains concerning for subdiaphragmatic free air.  However,
 note that due to difficulty with patient positioning, a true upright
 radiograph could not be obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible pneumoperitoneum, which should be further evaluated with a left
 lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph or cross-sectional imaging.
 2. Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar consolidations.
 3. Chronic severe cardiomegaly.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  At the time of this dictation, a subsequent CT abdomen had been
 ordered for further evaluation of possible pneumoperitoneum.
