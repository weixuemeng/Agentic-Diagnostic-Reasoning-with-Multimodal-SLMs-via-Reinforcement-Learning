  New left lower lobe consolidation compared to approximately 4 hr earlier.
  Given the acute change, this may represent re-expansion pulmonary edema or
  possibly aspiration. Pneumonia is less likely.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with complex course pleural effusion s/p
 thoracentesis today  // evaluate for pulmonary edema, aspiration, pneumothorax
 evaluate for pulmonary edema, aspiration, pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Color chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 1:24
 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The immediate post thoracentesis radiograph, at 13:24 today showed minimal if
 any consolidation at the base of the left lung following thoracentesis of the
 moderate pleural effusion. There was no detectable residual effusion or
 pneumothorax at that time. Now there is a small left pleural effusion and at
 least a moderate degree of consolidation at the base more than 4 hr after the
 thoracentesis. That would be an unusual delay for the onset of post
 re-expansion pulmonary edema and raises the possibility instead of massive
 aspiration or pneumonia. Pulmonary hemorrhage, if related to the
 thoracentesis, would also have been expected on the earlier postprocedure
 radiograph.  There may be a small right pleural effusion may be layering
 posteriorly.  Upper lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  Right PIC line ends in
 the upper SVC.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 9:05 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings. 
 Followup radiographs will be obtained this morning.
