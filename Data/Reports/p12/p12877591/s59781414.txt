                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Findings reported in the recent radiograph, including elevated hila, biapical
 opacities, and enlarged right hilum are similar in appearance to the prior
 outside hospital radiograph of ___. A 5 mm right upper lobe nodule seen
 in the recent OSH chest CT is below the limits of the plain radiograph. Right
 hilar enlargement likely corresponds to a prominent pulmonary artery on prior
 CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with mental status changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated with mild flattening of the diaphragms. 
 Mild elevation of the left hilum, with poorly defined left upper lung
 opacities. Similar but less severe changes in the right upper lobe, are
 associated with a mildly enlarged right hilum. The pleural surfaces are smooth
 without, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild calcification of the aortic
 knob is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology. Elevated hila, with biapical
 opacities, and enlarged right hilum, may relate to prior infection.
 Recommended comparison with prior imaging studies, if unavailable a chest CT
 is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Findings added to radiology critical findings dashboard.
