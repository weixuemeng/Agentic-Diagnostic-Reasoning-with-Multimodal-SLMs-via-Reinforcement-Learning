                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post laparoscopic,
 hand-assisted right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass, Meckel's
 diverticulectomy.  Concern for colon carcinoma, chest examination to look for
 possible metastases.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  On the present examination, the
 diaphragms are in higher position indicating poor inspirational effort.  This
 coincides with bilateral plate atelectasis, crowded appearance of pulmonary
 vasculature.  Although diaphragms are elevated, there is no conclusive
 evidence for any pleural effusion accumulating in the lateral pleural sinuses.
 A right-sided basal density is seen on the frontal view, represents an
 atelectasis, which has increased in size.  In the left hemithorax and mid lung
 field, a lateral focal parenchymal density has developed and appears to be in
 contact with the pleural space.  On the lateral view, there is evidence of
 mild blunting at the posterior pleural sinuses. The frontal view does not
 disclose any pneumothorax on either side in the apical area.
 
 Heart size is grossly unchanged and there is no evidence of acute pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poor inspirational effort in this patient status post colectomy,
 with bilateral basal plate atelectasis and crowded pulmonary vasculature.  A
 local peripheral infiltrate has developed on the left lung mid portion.  This
 is not typical for metastases, but could  be explained as small pulmonary
 infarction and  has developed during the latest examination interval since
 ___.
