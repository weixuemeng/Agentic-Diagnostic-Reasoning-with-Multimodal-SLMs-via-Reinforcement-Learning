                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:50 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and left upper quadrant abdominal pain,
 rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating what is at least mild cardiomegaly
 and some pulmonary vascular engorgement, and probably explaining
 mild-to-moderate bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  I doubt that there is
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia or appreciable pleural effusion.
