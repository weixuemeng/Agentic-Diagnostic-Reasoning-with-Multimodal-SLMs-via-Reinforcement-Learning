                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute onset left-sided chest pain, pleuritic
 in nature.  No history trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and normal
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  Although no pleural line is seen, the
 lung markings cannot be definitively identified in the left apex.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung markings are not well seen in the left apex, although a pleural line is
 also not identified.  However, given the specificity of the patient's
 symptoms, a right lateral decubitus radiograph is recommended to further
 evaluate for small spontaneous pneumothorax.
