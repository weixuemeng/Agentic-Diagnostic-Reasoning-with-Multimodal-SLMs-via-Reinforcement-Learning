                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lingular segment pulmonary nodule, s/p
 VATS lingulectomy  // Post-pull film
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the left-sided chest tube.  No pneumothorax
 seen.  A left perihilar opacity likely reflects a small amount loculated
 pleural fluid, a tiny adjacent metallic density is likely a surgical clip. 
 This is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.  The right lung
 appears grossly clear.  Volume loss in the left lung consistent with recent
 surgery.  Small amount surgical emphysema.  Degenerative changes throughout
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax seen.  A perihilar opacity at the left hilum may reflect
 loculated pleural fluid versus a parenchymal hematoma.
