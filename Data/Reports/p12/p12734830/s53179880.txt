                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right rib pain status post blunt trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is pleural thickening along the lateral right mid hemithorax of
 indeterminate age, given lack of priors for comparison, but related to recent
 injury is not excluded.  No discrete rib fracture is identified however,
 dedicated rib series or oblique views are more sensitive.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Apparent focal pleural thickening along the lateral right mid hemithorax of
 indeterminate age, could relate to acute trauma.  No discrete rib fracture
 seen, however, dedicated rib series or CT is more sensitive.
