                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent fall, chest wall tenderness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt edema.  Patchy left perihilar and bibasilar opacities may
 reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  No displaced
 fractures are identified.  Calcification within the left neck correlates to a
 calcified nodule in the thyroid gland on CT of the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the left perihilar area and both lung
 bases are nonspecific, and may reflect areas of atelectasis, but infection in
 the left lung base cannot be completely in the correct clinical setting.
