                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  New atrial fibrillation; patient on immunosuppression.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic
 arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the
 right lower lung is a nodular density measuring about 8 mm in diameter
 superimposed on background bronchovascular structures, raising concern for a
 nodule, although a nipple shadow is suspected.  Slight degenerative changes
 are noted along the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the right lower lung, possibly a nipple
 shadow.  However, when clinically appropriate, follow up repeat PA view with
 nipple markers is recommended for confirmation and further assessment.
