 HISTORY:  Left VATS anterior mediastinal mass biopsy.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP CHEST:  Large left pneumothorax shifts the mediastinum only

 unlikely to be causing hemodynamic tension.  Right lung is mildly over
 perfused.  Heart size is normal.  Findings were reported to Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 1:25pm on ___.  He said he was already aware of the
 pneumothorax.
