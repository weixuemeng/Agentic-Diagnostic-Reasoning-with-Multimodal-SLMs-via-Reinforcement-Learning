                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. 
 Calcification of the aortic arch is redemonstrated.  The pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Again demonstrated is a retrocardiac opacity, which again may
 represent atelectasis or aspiration.  The right lung is grossly clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is likely a small left pleural effusion.  Mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent retrocardiac consolidative opacity which may reflect atelectasis
 and/or aspiration.  Small left pleural effusion.
