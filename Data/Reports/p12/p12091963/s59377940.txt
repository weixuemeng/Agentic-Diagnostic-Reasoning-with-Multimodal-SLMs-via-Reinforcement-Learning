                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 9:41 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with left lower lobe consolidation on ___
 chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The left lower lobe consolidation persists and has an unquestioned component
 of volume loss suggesting it could be due to atelectasis alone though that
 could be explained by aspiration which would make the patient prone to
 subsequent pneumonia.  Right side of the chest is normal.  Pleural effusion on
 the left is small if any.  Heart size normal.  No pneumothorax.
