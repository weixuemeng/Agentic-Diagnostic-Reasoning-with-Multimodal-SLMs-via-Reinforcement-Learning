                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided flank pain, malaise and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal. Lung volumes are low. Platelike atelectasis at the left base is
 moderate. Left hemidiaphragm is indistinct on lateral view with suggestion of
 haziness. Right lung is clear. No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left base platelike atelectasis with indistinct left hemidiaphragm on
 lateral view with suggestion of surrounding hazy opacity.  While this almost
 certainly represents atelectasis, particularly given low lung volumes,
 infection is difficult to exclude in the given clinical context.
