                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD8 colostomy reversal with new oxygen
 requirement, unable to wean off NC  // please eval for pulmonary edema vs.
 atelectasis vs. ?PNA vs other causes new oxygen requirement    please eval for
 pulmonary edema vs. atelectasis vs. ?PNA vs other causes new oxygen
 requirement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has nearly resolved, and bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis though still considerable has improved.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged and the pulmonary vasculature is still engorged.  Small left pleural
 effusion is probably not new.  No pneumothorax.
 
 15 mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the lateral extent of subsegmental
 atelectasis in the right lower lobe, could be atelectasis also.  I would
 recommend repeat chest radiographs when other acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormalities have resolved.
 
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute
 pulmonary embolism, which would require chest CTA for diagnosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute
 pulmonary embolism, which would require chest CTA for diagnosis.
