                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of leg pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 appear clear on the frontal view.  However, posterior left base opacity may
 represent overlapping structures, although early consolidation cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
