                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well-expanded lungs.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Confluent opacification of the
 left upper lobe with air bronchograms, in the setting of cough and fever, is
 compatible with pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Left upper lobe pneumonia. Follow up radiograph is recommended after treatment
 to ensure resolution.
