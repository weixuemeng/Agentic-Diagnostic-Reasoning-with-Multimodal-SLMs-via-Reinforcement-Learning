                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L5/S1 PLIF w/fever.  // PNA?      PNA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 heart. No evidence of vascular congestion. Areas of increased opacification
 are seen at both bases, most likely relating to atelectasis. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would certainly have to
 be considered.
