                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/hx of CHF, with recent rib fx, crackles R>L. 
 // Is there evidence of pneumonia?      Is there evidence of pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are multiple old rib
 fractures bilaterally.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with bilateral
 pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis, more prominent on the
 right.  Mild prominence of interstitial markings suggests some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 Although no definite consolidation is appreciated, pneumonia would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude given the other changes in the chest.
