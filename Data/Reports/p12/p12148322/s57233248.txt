 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer, now with talc

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with distal lead tip in the mid SVC,
 unchanged.  There are again seen areas of consolidation and increased density
 in the left mid to lower lung fields consistent with the patient's talc
 pleurodesis.  There is a left-sided chest tube with distal lead tip projecting
 over the left main stem bronchus and perihilar region.  This is stable.  There
 is no pneumothorax identified on either side.  Overall, the findings are
 stable.
