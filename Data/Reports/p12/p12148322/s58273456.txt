                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer, on chemo; large left pleural
 effusion, chest tube insertion, pleurodesis, chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left chest tube has been removed.  Minimal air in small pleural effusion at
 left costodiaphragmatic angle is seen.  There is no apical pneumothorax.  Left
 lower lung opacity is probably due to incomplete reexpansion of the lung. 
 Cardiac contour is top normal.  Port-A-Cath is in adequate position.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Minimal air is seen at left costodiaphragmatic angle in small pleural
 effusion after chest tube removal.  There is no significant apical
 pneumothorax.  
 2.  Incomplete reexpansion of left lower lung.
