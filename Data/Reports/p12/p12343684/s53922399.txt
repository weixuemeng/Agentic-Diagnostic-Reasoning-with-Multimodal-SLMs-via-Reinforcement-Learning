                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachycardia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low, but there is no focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  New right middle lobe opacities
 located medially and giving the decrease in the position of the minor fissure
 might represent atelectasis potentially of right middle lobe or of right lower
 lobe.  No other focal consolidations demonstrated.
 
 Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  New atelectasis of most likely right middle
 lobe (less likely right lower lobe).  No definitive consolidation to suggest
 infection demonstrated.
