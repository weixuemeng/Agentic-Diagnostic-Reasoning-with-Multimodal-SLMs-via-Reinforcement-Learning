 INDICATION:

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent linear right upper lung opacity is again seen.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are hyperinflated but clear.  There is no focal consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Persistent nodular right upper lumbar opacity unchanged from multiple prior
 exams and is most likely due to scarring.  Longer term followup to confirm
 stability could be considered, especially in light of suspected underlying
 emphysema.
