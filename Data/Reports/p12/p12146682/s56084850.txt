                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with palpitations  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Again noted is an linearly oriented nodular
 opacity in the right upper lobe, unchanged since ___, with
 associated right upper lobe volume loss.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 2.  Persistent, linearly oriented nodular right upper lobe opacity.  Although
 potentially due to scarring, further evaluation with chest CT may be helpful
 to exclude a slow growing lung adenocarcinoma or indolent infection.
