                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of congestive heart failure,
 presenting with hypoxia and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker/AICD generator and leads are in
 standard unchanged position.  Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is
 new from prior examination and suggests developing mild pulmonary edema. 
 Additionally, indistinctness of the hila, enlargement of the main pulmonary
 arteries, and progressive cardiomegaly also suggests developing edema.  There
 is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild pulmonar edema, though no large effusions.
 2.  Standard unchanged position of pacemaker/AICD generator and leads.
