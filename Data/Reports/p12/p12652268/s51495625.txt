                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with COPD with acute pneumonia and shortness of breath, eval
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 A right IJ terminates in the lower SVC. A left lower lobe consolidation is new
 compared to prior study and obscures the left hemidiaphgragm.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions are increased as well. One nodule seen on CT scan from
 ___ can be localized on the left lower lung zone.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity may be secondary to atelectasis but a
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat imaging with left
 anterior oblique view for better assessment of parenchymal abnormalities.
