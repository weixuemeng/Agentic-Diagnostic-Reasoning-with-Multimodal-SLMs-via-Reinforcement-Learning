  Since the prior exam, perhaps slightly increasing edema as well as a right
  lower lobe atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancytopenia, CAD, shortness of breath, question pulmonary edema
 versus pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No
 overt CHF is identified.  There is minimal atelectasis at both bases. No focal
 infiltrate to confirm the presence of pneumonia is identified.
 
 An 8.5 mm nodular density is seen at the left lung base and may have been
 obscured by the diaphragm on the prior film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 3.  Minimal patchy opacity at both bases, without gross change,  atelectasis. 
 Given the history of pancytopenia, it is difficult to exclude early changes of
 a pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 4.  8.5 mm nodular density at the left lung base.  If clinically indicated, CT
 could help for further assessment.
