 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, right central venous
 catheter terminates in the mid-to-lower SVC.  The signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have mildly improved as compared to the previous image. 
 However, bilateral areas of atelectasis persist.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no evidence of new focal parenchymal
 opacities in the lung parenchyma, potentially suspicious for the presence of
 infection.
