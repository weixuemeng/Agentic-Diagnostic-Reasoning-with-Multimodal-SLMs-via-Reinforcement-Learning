 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size for technique
 and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  A wedge-shaped area
 of opacity in the right juxtahilar region has slightly progressed in the
 interval, and is now accompanied by a poorly-defined opacity at the right lung
 base and patchy and linear opacities in the left base.  Observed findings may
 represent multifocal pneumonia coexisting with atelectasis.
