                                 FINAL REPORT
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the feeding tube looped in the left chest, compatible
 with the patient's known history of left diaphragmatic hernia.  Left
 subclavian line tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged.  The ET tube is 4.9 cm above the carina.  There is increased
 opacity in the right lower lobe adjacent to the hemidiaphragm likely
 representing increased area of infiltrate in the right lower lung.  Otherwise,
 the appearance of the lungs are unchanged.
