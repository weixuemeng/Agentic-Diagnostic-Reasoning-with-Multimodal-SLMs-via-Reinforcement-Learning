 effusion, question of pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Barium was given orally and is mostly found in the stomach.  Left lower lobe
 opacities are less impressive today.  There is air in the stomach which is
 higher than usual : as shown on prior CT, the stomach is going in a left
 Bochdalek hernia.  Probable small pleural effusions.
 
 A tiny ill defined line is seen in the left apex adjacent to the chest wall
 without any significant visible pneumothorax.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no significant pneumothorax.
