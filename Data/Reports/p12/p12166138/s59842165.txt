                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: ___-year-old man with recurrent pneumonia.  Evaluate for pneumonia,
 CHF, COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This film was extremely limited due to difficulty in positioning
 the patient.  With this difficulty in mind, there are patchy opacities in the
 right lung along with more dense opacification of the right lower lobe
 medially consistent with collapse.  The left lung is very grossly clear,
 however in the left hemithorax there is an additional rounded opacity with
 apparent bowel within it, possibly eventration or a diaphragmatic hernia.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciable.
