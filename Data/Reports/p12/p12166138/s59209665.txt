                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of worsened pneumonia, finished
 course of antibiotics and now with new fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest again demonstrate opacification in
 the left lower lobe with some volume loss.  There is a lucency near left
 costophrenic angle that could represent loculated fluid with trapped air
 verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance of stomach bubble.  Follow up
 upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just
 prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies.  The lungs are
 otherwise well expanded and clear.  There is no right pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible area of loculated fluid with trapped air verses
 pneumothorax verses atypical appearance of stomach bubble near the left CPA. 
 Follow up upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium
 just prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies.
