 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

 4.4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip overlying the stomach, in
 the setting of a left diaphragmatic hernia.  
 
 Patchy opacity in the right mid and lower zones is similar, compared with one
 day earlier.  Opacity in the left base is related to the hernia, possibly with
 some associated atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Patchy right mid and lower zone opacities and minimal atelectasis left base,
 in the setting of a left diaphragmatic hernia, are essentially unchanged.
