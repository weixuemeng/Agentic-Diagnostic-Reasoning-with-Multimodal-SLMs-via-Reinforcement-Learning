 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:06 PM
  Dobhoff tube seen terminating wtihin the stomach, which is elevated through a
  diaphragmatic hernia, better seen on prior CT examinations. This is
  subsequently replaced by an NGT which also terminates in the ___ area, but is
  oriented inferiorly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New OG tube placement, intubated for pneumonia.
 
 Chest, two AP views which demonstrate different findings and which were
 presumably taken at different points in time.  A third AP view appears to
 represent a duplicate.  The films are not labelled as to order. 
 
 One view shows a Dobbhoff-type tube with radiopaque tip overlying the left
 lower chest, which apparently corresponds to the stomach, within an elevated
 or herniated diaphrag, anatomy which was seen on multiple prior CTs.  
 
 Another view shows a conventional NG tube, overlying the intrathoracic
 stomach, pointing inferiorly, the tip overlying the diaphragm. The Dobhoff is
 not seen on this view. 
 
 On the right, there is patchy opacity in the mid and lower zones similar to
 ___ at 10:12 a.m.  On the left, opacity at left base likely relates to the
 hernia.  Some associated atelectasis cannot be excluded.  Doubt overt CHF.  No
 effusion identified.  An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position
 approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Two different AP views, one showing a Dobhoff-type tube and one showing
 NG-type tube, detailed above. Elevated or herniated left hemidiaphragm noted.
 
 2) Right mid and lower zone opacity, unchanged c/w ___.
