                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia and PE, requiring assessment of
 endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate endotracheal tube in
 position with tip 4.4 cm above the carina, essentially unchanged from previous
 imaging.  There is some opacification at the left lung base again seen, which
 likely represents atelectasis but cannot rule out an effusion.  Opacification
 in the right lung base may represent atelectasis; however, in appropriate
 clinical setting, could also be concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen.
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube in appropriate position.  Right basilar opacity could be
 concerning for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
