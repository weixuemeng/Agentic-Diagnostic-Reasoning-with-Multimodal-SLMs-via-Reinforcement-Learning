                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with clogged dobhoff, now being replaced.
 Please provide 2 stage xray for dobhoff placement. Thank you.  // 2-stage CXR
 for dobhoff placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views portable chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The 2 available images show steps related to placement of a Dobhoff tube.  On
 the second image, the tip of the Dobhoff tube is within the stomach. Somewhat
 suboptimal and prior tree effort resulting crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature and apparent mild cardiomegaly, this was not present on the prior
 study in this likely therefore artifactual.  Unremarkable bowel gas
 distribution.  No free air seen under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The second image demonstrates the tip of the Dobhoff tube is within the
 stomach.
