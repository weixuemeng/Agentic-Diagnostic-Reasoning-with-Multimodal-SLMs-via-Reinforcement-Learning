                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post thoracentesis, assess effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been placement of a feeding tube seen coiled in the
 stomach and tip residing in the likely position of the gastric antrum.  There
 is a persistent small to moderate pleural effusion which is overall stable in
 size from ___ CT scan.  Associated compressive atelectasis in the left
 lower lung is likely present and the possibility of pneumonia is impossible to
 exclude.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact. 
 DISH-related changes of the T-spine noted.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small to moderate left effusion with associated lower lung
 consolidation/atelectasis.  Unchanged position of the feeding tube.
