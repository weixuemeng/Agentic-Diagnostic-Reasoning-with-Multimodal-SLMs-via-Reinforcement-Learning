                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a
 prior CTA chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypotension, on chemotherapy with
 metastatic renal cell carcinoma, abdominal and rectal pain, assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is known
 to have extensive metastatic disease within the chest with loculated left
 pleural effusion.  Overall appearance of the chest appears essentially stable
 compared with multiple prior exams.  Please note evaluation for subtle
 differences would be limited due to extensive underlying metastatic burden. 
 Heart size cannot be readily assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly
 stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Imaged osseous structures appear grossly
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive metastatic disease in the chest, which appears grossly
 stable compared with prior exams.
