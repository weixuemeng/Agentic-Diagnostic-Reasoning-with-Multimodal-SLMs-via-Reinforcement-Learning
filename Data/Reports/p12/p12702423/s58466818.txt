                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CT from ___ as well as chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In
 comparison with scout image from CT from ___, again seen is a large left
 perihilar mid-to-lower lung opacity which on the prior CT corresponded to
 innumerable pulmonary nodules, although superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  Nodular opacities in the right lung to a lesser extent than on the
 right are again seen.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely
 corresponding to pleural effusion and is also seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right pulmonary opacities similar as compared
 to scout image from CT from ___, given differences in technique, although
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  Slight blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is likely due to small left pleural effusion.
