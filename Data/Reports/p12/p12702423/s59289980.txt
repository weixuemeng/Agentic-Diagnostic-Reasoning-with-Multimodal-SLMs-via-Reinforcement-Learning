                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia.  History of renal cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A persistent patchy opacification in the left mid and lower lung
 fields, unchanged from the prior exam.  The right lower lung aeration has
 improved from the prior exam with resolution of the previously seen opacity. 
 Multiple small nodules are seen bilaterally, consistent with the patient's
 known history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  No new opacifications are
 present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improvement in right lower lobe aeration with resolution of previously
 seen opacity.
 1.  Persistent left mid and lower lung opacification.
 2.  Multiple pulmonary nodules, consistent with known history of metastatic
 renal cell carcinoma.
