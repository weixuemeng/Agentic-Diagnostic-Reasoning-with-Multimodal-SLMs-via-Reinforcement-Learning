                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with elevated troponin, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  none
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Right upper lobe atelectasis is of unknown chronicity without older
 radiographs for comparison.  If it is acute, it could be due to a mucus plug
 in the bronchus; however, an obstructing mass is also possible, especially
 considering slight rounded contour and increased density of the right hilum.
 Minimal interstitial lung markings at lung bases, also of unknown chronicity,
 could reflect atelectasis or focal scarring/fibrosis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Partial right upper lobe collapse of uncertain chronicity. A short-term
 followup chest x-ray is suggested during this hospitalization stay.  If
 persistent, a chest CT would be recommended to exclude an obstructing
 malignancy mass.
 
 This was discussed with the medical team by Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at
 ___ am.
