                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a chest
 tube, its tip projecting over right apex with associated reexpansion of the
 right lung.  Small apical pneumothorax persists.  Linear lucency projecting
 over axilla likely represents a small subcutaneous gas.  Left lung is well
 expanded and clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of the right-sided chest tube with reexpansion of the right
 lung.  Small right apical pneumothorax persists.
