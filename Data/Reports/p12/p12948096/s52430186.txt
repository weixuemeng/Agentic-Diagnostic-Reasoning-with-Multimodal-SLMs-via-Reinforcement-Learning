                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with spontaneous pneumothorax, status
 post chest tube placement, evaluate position and possible resolution of
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The right-sided pigtail end catheter remains in unchanged
 apical position in the right hemithorax overlying the anterior portion of the
 second rib on the frontal view.  This is unchanged in comparison with the
 preceding study.  The apical pneumothorax widening is minimal and less than 1
 cm.  A small loculated right basal pneumothorax is still present and a small
 amount of pleural fluid blunts the right lateral pleural sinus.  No other new
 pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Heart size is within normal limits and no
 pulmonary congestion exists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further regression of pneumothorax, unchanged position of
 drainage tube.
