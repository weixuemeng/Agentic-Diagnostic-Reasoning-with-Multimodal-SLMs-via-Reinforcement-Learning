                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in pleural effusion and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Series of prior radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates a
 stable small right pleural effusion and a chest tube in place.  Although no
 pleural line is seen, the pulmonary vascular markings at the right apex are
 not as clearly visible on this study, raising concern for a small right apical
 pneumothorax.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax on the left.  There is
 right basilar atelectasis, but the lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Equivocal small right apical pneumothorax for which PA and lateral
 radiograph would normally be recommended; however, the patient is on wall
 suction and cannot be transported at this time.  Continued close followup is
 recommended.
 2.  The small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 on ___ at 5:15 p.m.
