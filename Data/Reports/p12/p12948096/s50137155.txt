                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in patient with spontaneous
 pneumothorax, exacerbated by placing the chest tube on waterseal, now back on
 suction.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the
 right-sided pneumothorax is now much smaller, seen as a pleural line only in
 the apex.  The right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.  Small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged in size; however, it no longer presents as a
 distinct air-fluid level, also supporting the interval decrease in amount of
 the pleural air.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in size of right pneumothorax since returning
 chest tube to suction.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.
