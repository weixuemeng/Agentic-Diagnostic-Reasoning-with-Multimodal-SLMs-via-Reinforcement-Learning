                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 19:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pneumothorax status post
 pleurodesis.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made previous study dated ___ at 11:12.
 
 A portable upright chest film, ___, at 19:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A right pigtail catheter coiled at the apex is again seen and a tiny right
 apical pneumothorax remains.  Both lungs are well inflated and clear.  There
 may be minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles, possibly representing
 pleural thickening or tiny effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable given patient positioning on the current
 examination.
