                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute hypoxemia during exploratory laparotomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ at 2:57 a.m.
 dating back to the preoperative radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates worsening
 pulmonary edema, as well as mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 This is particularly apparent in the left upper lung field, which was much
 clearer on the prior study from only five hours ago.  A small left pleural
 effusion is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is minimally
 decreased from the prior study, possibly reflecting changes in mechanical
 ventilation parameters.
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates at least 2.3 cm above the carina with the chin
 in elevated position.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminates appropriately in the low SVC.  An orogastric tube is appropriately
 positioned with the side port located within the stomach.  Aortic
 calcifications are once again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Low-lying endotracheal
 tube, which could be retracted 2 cm to prevent inadvertent intubation of the
 right main stem bronchus.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at ___ pm.
