                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for effusion.  The patient is status post exploratory
 laparotomy with acute desaturation event.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 BEDSIDE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  Minimal improvement in the degree
 of pulmonary edema compared to the study from yesterday.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There continues to be stable widening of the upper
 mediastinum reflecting elevated central venous pressure.  The heart size is
 normal.  A small left pleural effusion persists and there is a new small
 right-sided pleural effusion as demonstrated by uniform right lower lung field
 opacity which obscures the hemidiaphragmatic contour.  A right IJ central line
 terminates appropriately in the low SVC.  The endotracheal tube has been
 withdrawn and now lies appropriately 3.7 cm above the carina.  The orogastric
 tube is unchanged in position, with the side port in the stomach.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small right pleural effusion.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Slight improvement in mild pulmonary edema with persistent evidence of
 elevated central venous pressure.
 3.  Endotracheal tube now in more optimal position, 3.7 cm above the carina.
