                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient of bilateral leg pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 Mediastinal contour in the region of the pulmonary outflow tract has always
 been mildly enlarged.  This can be a normal finding in young women.  It would
 nevertheless be reasonable to evaluate the patient clinically for any evidence
 of pulmonic valvular abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
