                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderate to severely enlarged.  Aortic knob calcifications are
 present.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally may suggest pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted.  No focal consolidation is seen.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 present.  Additionally, severe degenerative changes of both glenohumeral and
 acromioclavicular joints are present with narrowing of the acromiohumeral
 intervals bilaterally suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Enlargement of the hila bilaterally may suggest underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
