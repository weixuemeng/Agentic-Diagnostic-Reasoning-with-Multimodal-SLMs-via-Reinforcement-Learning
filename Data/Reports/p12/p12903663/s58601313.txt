                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever, confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and appears somewhat globular
 in appearance, which could be due to an underlying pericardial effusion versus
 cardiomyopathy.  Slight prominence and indistinctness of the hila may be due
 to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aortic knob
 is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Basilar consolidation is difficult to exclude on this study.  Enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with globular configuration, underlying pericardial
 effusion is not excluded.
