                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mini MVR, status post chest tube pulled, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the chest tubes have been removed.  The
 possibility of a tiny right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  No other
 evidence of pneumothorax is detected.   There is slightly more pronounced
 atelectasis at the right base.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
