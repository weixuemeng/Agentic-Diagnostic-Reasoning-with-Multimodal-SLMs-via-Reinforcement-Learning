                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI, MVR, r/o pneumothorax, chest tube to water shield.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 A tiny apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded, but no definite pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 Two right-sided chest tubes are present.  Additionally, a thin wire density
 overlies the lower right lung.  A right IJ sheath is present, tip over
 proximalmost SVC.  Compared to the film from one day earlier, the ETT, NGT and
 Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  The prosthetic valve
 is again noted. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, slightly
 more pronounced.   There is patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region and a
 small left effusion, slightly worse compared with the prior study.  The upper
 zones of both lungs are grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  No
 measurable pneumothorax is seen.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation as well as left effusions
 which have progressed compared with one day earlier.  
 3.  Minimal atelectasis at right base is also worse.
 4. Interval removal of ET tube, NG tube and Swan-Ganz catheter.
