                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with   ongoing right lower posterior rib pain with
 chronic cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided AICD/ pacer device is noted with leads in unchanged positions. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The thoracic aorta is diffusely calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Subsegmental atelectasis is noted in both lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged in the
 left proximal humeral diaphysis is a geographic sclerotic lesion, possibly an
 enchondroma or bone infarct, incompletely assessed.  Deformity of the distal
 left clavicle is unchanged, compatible with prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation. 
 Partially imaged sclerotic lesion in the left proximal humeral diaphysis,
 possibly an enchondroma or bone infarct.
