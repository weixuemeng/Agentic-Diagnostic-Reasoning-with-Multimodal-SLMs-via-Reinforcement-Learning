                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus.  The cardiac silhouette
 size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity within the right lower
 lobe is essentially new in the interval, and may reflect an area developing
 infection.  Mild atelectasis is also seen in the left lung base.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel moderate
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lobe opacity is concerning for infection in the correct
 clinical setting.
