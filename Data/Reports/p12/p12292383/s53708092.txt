                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains
 at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged, with a three-channel pacer
 device in place.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles likely reflects pleural
 thickening.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
