                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with metastatic colon cancer in CT.  There was
 pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation on the left, assess for
 progression.
 
 The cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinal lymph nodes are better seen in
 prior CT.  New opacities in the right middle lobe could be due to atelectasis.
 A superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the left side, are grossly unchanged from prior
 associated with increasing adjacent atelectasis.  Right Port-A-Cath tip is in
 the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Previously described nodule in the left lower lobe cannot be assessed in the
 exam, is obscured by the pleural parenchymal abnormalities.
