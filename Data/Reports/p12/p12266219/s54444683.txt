                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued opacification
 at the right base medially that appears as a band of increased opacification
 on the lateral view.  Again, this appearance is consistent with consolidation
 in the right middle lobe.
 
 In view of the persistence of this appearance, CT could be suggested to
 exclude a central obstructing lesion.
