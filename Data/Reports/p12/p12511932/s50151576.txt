                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest Radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting after a fall; evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Increased opacity in the right lower lobe may
 reflect pneumonia or aspiration in the appropriate clinical situation or
 contusion given the provided history of fall.  No pneumothorax or evidence of
 large pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.  The heart is top-normal in size.
 The mediastinum is not widened.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  Vertebral body heights appear grossly preserved with
 mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  This exam is not
 dedicated for imaging of the ribs and portions of the lower bilateral ribs are
 not included on the images provided.  Among the visualized ribs, no obvious
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity could reflect pneumonia or aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical situation.  Contusions in the setting of provided history
 of trauma is also possible.  Correlate with clinical assessment and focal exam
 findings.
 
 2.  No obvious fracture; however, this exam is not dedicated for imaging of
 osseous structures and portions of the lower ribs are not included on these
 images.  Recommend correlation with focal exam findings and obtaining
 dedicated radiographs specific to these regions as needed.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated radiographs localized to specific regions of
 focal exam findings there is persistent concern for fracture.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:38 AM, 5 minutes after
