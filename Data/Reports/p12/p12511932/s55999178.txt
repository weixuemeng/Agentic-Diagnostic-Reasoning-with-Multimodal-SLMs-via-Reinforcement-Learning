                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aspiration, subdural hematoma with new NGT
 placement  // NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Dobbhoff type tube is present.  The radiopaque tip lies in the region of the
 GE junction.  The distal most portion of the radiopaque tip overlies the
 uppermost portion of the fundus.  Note is made of a radiolucent segment
 measuring 16 mm between the tubing and the densely radiopaque tip.
 
 Probable background hyperinflation/COPD.  Possible mild cardiomegaly.  Upper
 zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 Large (6.9 x ___.8 cm) opacity the right base is essentially new compared with
 ___ and there is now a new or slightly more pronounced small right
 pleural effusion.
 
 There is also increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms that is
 slightly worse.  The left hemidiaphragm remains visible and no gross left
 pleural effusion is seen.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Surgical clips noted in right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left NG tube tip lies in the region of the GE junction and uppermost
 fundus.  Please see details above.
 
 New,  relatively large faint opacity at the right lung is concerning for
 aspiration pneumonitis.  Pneumonic consolidation and atelectasis are
 considered less likely but also in the differential.  Small right effusion.
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation, slightly worse.
