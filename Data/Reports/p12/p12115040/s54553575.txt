                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis
 (Wegener's).  On Rituxan and Prednisone.  h/o Lung nodules on chest CT. 
 Transient GG opacities but resolved on last CT.  Now with cough, DOE, fatigue,
 and ? LLL crackles  // r/o new infiltrate.    r/o new infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, Edit there is little change
 in the faint left lower lung opacification most likely representing a
 granuloma. Hyperexpansion of the lungs process and there is no evidence of
 acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 There is in an area of opacification that could be calcified at the left base
 medially.  This is quite similar to a less-well-seen opacification in that
 region on the previous study.
