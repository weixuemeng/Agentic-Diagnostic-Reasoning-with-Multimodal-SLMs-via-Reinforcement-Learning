                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with DOE, patient with known metastatic breast cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip in the region of the lower SVC.  There is a
 large left upper lobe mass which is better assessed on the recent prior chest
 CT exam and is highly concerning for metastatic disease. Scattered pulmonary
 nodules are compatible with known metastatic disease.  Lung volumes are low
 which somewhat limits the evaluation.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and compressive atelectasis in the left lower lung.  There is
 mild right basal atelectasis also noted.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  No
 large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive metastatic disease in the chest with large left upper lobe mass and
 innumerable small nodules.  Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
