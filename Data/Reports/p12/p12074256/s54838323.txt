 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is grossly stable in position likely terminating at
 the proximal right atrium.Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar. 
 There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with possible
 overlying increase in left base atelectasis.  Increased right base opacity is
 also seen, possibly due to atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in bibasilar opacities could be due to worsening atelectasis or
 pneumonia/aspiration.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
