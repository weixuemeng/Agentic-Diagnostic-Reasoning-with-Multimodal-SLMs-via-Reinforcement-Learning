                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with altered mental status and hypoglycemia,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are noted. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. Fullness of the right
 hilum may reflect bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes
 and a suboptimal inspiratory effort, however, underlying abnormality is unable
 to be excluded.  Recommend comparison with old chest x-rays or a followup non
 urgent upright PA and lateral chest x-ray to assess for resolution. Otherwise,
 a streaky opacity at the right lung base likely represents platelike
 atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hilar fullness possibly reflective of bronchovascular crowding due to
 low lung volumes, however, underlying abnormality unable to be excluded.
 Recommend comparison with prior chest x-rays or 4- week followup upright PA
 and lateral chest x-ray to assess for resolution. Otherwise, no focal lung
 consolidation.
