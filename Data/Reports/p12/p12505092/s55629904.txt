                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new cervical mass.  Evaluate for
 intrathoracic malignancy.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hardware overlies the lower cervical spine consistent with previous
 cervical fusion.  Lungs are relatively well inflated without evidence of focal
 airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  The interstitium
 is slightly prominent, but this may reflect small airways disease, age related
 changes or smoking-related changes.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No acute bony
 abnormality is seen.  Depending upon the etiology of the patient's cervical
 mass, additional imaging with CT could be undertaken.  Minimal degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine with no obvious vertebral compression fractures.
