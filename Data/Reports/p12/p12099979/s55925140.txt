                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for 2 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle increase in opacity in the right middle lobe on both frontal and
 lateral views raises concern for a small/early consolidation possibly due to
 pneumonia.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings raise concern for possible early/developing right middle lobe
 pneumonia.
