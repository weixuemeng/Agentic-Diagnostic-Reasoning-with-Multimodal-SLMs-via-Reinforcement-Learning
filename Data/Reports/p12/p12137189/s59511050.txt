 The patient is Re intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm
 above the carinal.  The course of a nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip
 is not visualized on the image.  The lung volumes have increased and the
 pre-existing diffuse parenchymal opacities have substantially decreased in
 extent and severity, likely as a result of intubation.  A minimal right
 pleural effusion is present.  No new focal parenchymal opacities. No
 pneumothorax.
