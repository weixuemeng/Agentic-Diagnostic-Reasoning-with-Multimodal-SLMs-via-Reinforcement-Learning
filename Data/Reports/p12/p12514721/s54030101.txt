                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 A discussion with the patient's housestaff___, on ___ at 4:50 p.m.
 revealed that the patient was upright on acquisition of this imaging study. No
 definite pleural line can be identified.  Therefore, it does not appear that
 there is a pneumothorax present, although it is unlikely that it could have
 resorbed this quickly.  Therefore, further imaging evaluation with either an
 expiratory chest film or CT should be considered.  As the patient is intubated
 and it is difficult to perform an expiratory chest film, the housestaff has
 elected to order a CT to confirm a pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath status post lung
 nodule, biopsy on ___.  Evaluate for infiltrate or pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable chest film, ___ at 10:01 is submitted.  The patient's
 position was not indicated on the study and therefore this is assumed to
 represent a supine radiograph which would lower the sensitivity for detecting
 a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The NG tube has been minimally advanced but the side port is still near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Further advancement by 4-5 cm would be advised. 
 The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carina and
 pullback of 2 cm, which was previously recommended, is still advised.  The
 previously seen pneumothorax is not well visualized on this study, but this
 could be related to supine technique.  Followup imaging in the upright
 position would be advised.  A clip is seen within a nodular opacity at the
 right medial base, which was placed by a CT-guided interventional procedure on
 ___, in this patient with known lung malignancy.  Overall, the
 lung volumes are slightly lower and there is patchy opacity at the right base,
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  No large effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
