                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer in right lower lobe, had prior
 pneumothorax with biopsy on ___; has neck pain and headaches since;
 possible subcutaneous emphysema.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and subcutaneous
 emphysema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ in conjunction with CT
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.  In the right
 upper lung there is a 7 mm nodular opacity which was not clearly present on
 the most recent prior chest radiograph or chest CT.  Additionally, there is a
 ___ 6 mm nodular opacity in the left mid lung which may correlate to a nodule
 seen on the most recent CT.  A metallic marker is seen within the right lower
 lung nodule, not significantly changed from prior.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. No pleural effusions are present.  A hiatal hernia is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 2. Right upper lung and left mid lung nodules, one possibly seen on prior CT.
 Recommend short-term follow up chest x-ray. If persistent, consider a chest
 CT, if warranted clinically, to assess for possible metastases.
