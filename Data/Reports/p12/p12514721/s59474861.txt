                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, right anterior pneumothorax, status post chest tube
 placement.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  The patient, however, has
 received a right anterior pleural drain.  The pre-existing right pneumothorax
 is not visible on the current image.  A linear opacity overlying the sixth and
 seventh right rib is symmetrical and obviously caused by a foreign body
 outside of the patient.  Close radiographic monitoring, however, is strongly
 recommended.
