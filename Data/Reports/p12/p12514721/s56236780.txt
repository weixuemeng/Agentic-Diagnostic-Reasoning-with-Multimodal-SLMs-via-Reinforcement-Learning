 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation, question

 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Nodular opacities project over the lower lungs likely representing nipple
 shadows.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  A retrocardiac density is
 compatible with known hiatal hernia.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
