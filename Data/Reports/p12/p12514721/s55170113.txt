                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 23:50
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and respiratory failure status
 post intubation, check endotracheal tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at
 17:17.
 
 Three portable supine chest films are submitted dated ___ at 23:50.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  On the initial image, the endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2 cm
 above the carina.  A pullback of 2 cm would be recommended.  The nasogastric
 tube is seen within the hiatal hernia, but the tip is at the level of the mid
 upper esophagus.  On the second image, the nasogastric tube has its tip within
 the hiatal hernia and on the third image, the tip is now below the diaphragm,
 but the side port is likely at the gastroesophageal junction and therefore
 advancement would still be recommended.
 
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax which is unchanged since the prior study
 ___ ___ at 17:17 but was not previously identified on the ___
 study.  This finding was conveyed to the patient's nurse, ___, on
 ___ at 8:45 a.m. by phone at the time of discovery.  Lungs are well
 inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions
 or pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged given differences in technique.  A metallic clip in the right lower
 lobe lies contiguous to a known malignancy when compared to the CT
 interventional procedure performed on ___.  Calcification of the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.
