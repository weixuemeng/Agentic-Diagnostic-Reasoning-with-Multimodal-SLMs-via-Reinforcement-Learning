                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right pleural effusion status post one liter removed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier the same date, at 17:35.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a catheter overlying the
 lateral right hemithorax.  There has been interval reduction in the
 right-sided pleural effusion, which is still large, however, now, aerated lung
 is seen at the superior half of the right hemithorax.  Suggestion of air
 bronchograms seen extending to the proximal right lower lung, although and
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The left lung is clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not accurately assessed due to the large right hemithorax opacity, although
 the left aspect is grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval reduction in right-sided pleural
 effusion/right hemithorax opacity, although the large opacity projecting over
 the mid-to-lower hemithorax persists, large pleural effusion persists. 
 Improved aeration of the right upper lung.
