                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increasing dyspnea at rest, large right pleural
 effusion, long smoking history.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with
 some aerated lung in the right upper medial hemithorax.  There is shift of the
 mediastinum to the left, which suggests an underlying right pleural effusion. 
 Underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 focal consolidation is seen in the left.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with an area
 of aerated lung seen projecting over the right upper hemithorax.  Shift of the
 mediastinum to the left suggests pleural effusion.  Underlying consolidation
 is difficult to exclude.
