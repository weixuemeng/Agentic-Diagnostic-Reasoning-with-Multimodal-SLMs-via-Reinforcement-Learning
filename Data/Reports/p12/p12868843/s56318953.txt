                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers, cough and CyberKnife treatment to
 right kidney.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Low inspiratory effort seen on the current exam,
 particularly on the lateral.  There is linear opacity projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette on the lateral likely due to atelectasis.  There is also
 faint increased opacity projecting over the posterior costophrenic angles
 which may also be due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There
 is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal as are
 the osseous and soft tissue structures.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Basilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis given lower lung
 volumes; however, given history, infection is not completely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation suggested.
