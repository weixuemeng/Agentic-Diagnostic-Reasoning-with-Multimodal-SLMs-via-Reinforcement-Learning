 ___ (wound washout)     ___ year old man with wound infection, plan for OR
 for washou
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs in ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
 
 Thoracic scoliosis, concave to the left, is more pronounced today than in
 ___, and may account, in part, for the disparity in the thickness of soft
 tissues of the chest wall, substantially greater on the left than right. This
 asymmetry may be responsible for the greater radiodensity of the left hemi
 thorax, but a pleural abnormality could also be present. Heart is normal size.
 Right lung is clear. There is no right pleural effusion.
 
 I strongly recommend conventional PA and lateral views to assess the left
 pleural space. Clinical evaluation of the left chest wall should clarify
 whether there is a abnormal soft tissue on the left side.
