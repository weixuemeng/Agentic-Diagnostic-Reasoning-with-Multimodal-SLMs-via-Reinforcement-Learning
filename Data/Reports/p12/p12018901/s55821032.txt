                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate cardiomegaly.  Diffuse hazy opacification of each lung has
 worsened and is most suggestive of pulmonary edema.  A focal component to
 opacification persists at the right lung base, but similar to the prior study;
 differential considerations include pneumonia, atelectasis or a focal region
 of edema.  There is no suggestion of substantial pleural effusion, although a
 small one would be difficult to exclude on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening diffuse hazy opacification suggestive of pulmonary
 edema; otherwise no significant change.
