 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable massive
 cardiomegaly. Increased opacification of the bilateral bases likely represents
 a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Indistinctness of the hila
 bilaterally and increased interstitial markings are consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema. No definite consolidation identified.
