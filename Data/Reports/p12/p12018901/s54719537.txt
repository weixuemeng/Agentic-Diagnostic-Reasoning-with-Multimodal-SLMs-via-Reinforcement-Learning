                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post failed right internal jugular
 central line placement.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ at 3:19 and 2:12 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is in unchanged
 expected position with the tip positioned 5.2 cm above the level of the
 carina.  There has been interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter, which
 courses below the diaphragm and is at least within the stomach, though the tip
 is incompletely imaged.  Overall aeration of the lungs is slightly worse
 compared to prior examination and is compatible with severe pulmonary edema. 
 No post-procedural pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No post-procedural pneumothorax.  Increasing pulmonary edema.
