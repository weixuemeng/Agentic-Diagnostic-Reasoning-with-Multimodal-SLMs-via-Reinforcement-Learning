                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman intubated for respiratory failure.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows stable positioning of
 supporting lines and tubes.  Note is again made that the left-sided central
 venous catheter tip is directed towards the right lateral wall of the SVC and
 could be advanced 2 cm or pulled back 1 cm.  Diffuse haziness in the
 parenchyma, particularly in the perihilar regions where peribronchial cuffing
 is seen, suggests edema, though ARDS could give a similar picture.  Marked
 cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No significant radiographic improvement in edema or ARDS and
 cardiomegaly.  If left-sided central venous catheter tip is to be
 longstanding, recommend either withdrawal 1 cm or advancement of approximately
 2 cm to avoid tip abutting right lateral wall of SVC.
