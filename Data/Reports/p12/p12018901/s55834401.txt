                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, confusion, congestive heart failure and
 end-stage renal disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lines, tubes and drains have been removed.  The heart is
 moderate-to-severely enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  Diffuse opacification of each lung is most suggestive of
 pulmonary edema.  Opacification is relatively confluent at the right lung base
 obscuring the right hemidiaphragm, not necessarily a different process, but
 could be reconsidered in short-term followp-up if coinciding more focal
 pneumonia is a potential clinical concern.  Subpulmonic pleural effusions are
 difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse opacification suggesting pulmonary edema.  Patchy more
 confluent right basilar opacity, probably compatible with an aspect of the
 same process, but short-term followup radiographs could be considered if
 developing pneumonia at the latter site is a potential clinical concern.
