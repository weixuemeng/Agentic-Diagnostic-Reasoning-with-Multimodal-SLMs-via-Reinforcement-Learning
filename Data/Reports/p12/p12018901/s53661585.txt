                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lethargy, end-stage renal disease.  Please evaluate
 for pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal contours appear
 stable, with calcification of the aorta again noted.  Again seen diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary edema, overall unchanged compared to the prior study. 
 There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  Again seen are bibasilar
 patchy opacities which may reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 osseous structures demonstrate diffuse multilevel degenerative changes within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Limited study due to body habitus, however there is no significant interval
 change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema.
