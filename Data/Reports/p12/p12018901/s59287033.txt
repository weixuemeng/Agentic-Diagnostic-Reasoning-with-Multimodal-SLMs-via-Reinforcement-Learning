                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contour appears stable,
 with calcification of the aorta again noted.  Mild pulmonary edema appears
 similar compared to the prior study.  There are likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
