                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough, fever, rhonchi
 on right.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to chest radiograph performed at ___, ___,
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle right
 base patchy opacity seen on the frontal view, not well appreciated on the
 lateral view, may be due to atelectasis, although an early consolidation
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Bilateral faint upper lobe nodular opacities are
 again seen, without significant interval change.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
