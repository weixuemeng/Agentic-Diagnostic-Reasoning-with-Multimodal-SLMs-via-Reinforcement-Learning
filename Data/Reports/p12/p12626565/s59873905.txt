                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable, and no
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Minimal linear opacities within the
 left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is present with multilevel
 degenerative changes noted.  There is mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic
 spine.  Additionally, mild compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction is noted, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  Compression deformity at the thoracolumbar
 junction.
