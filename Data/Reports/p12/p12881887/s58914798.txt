                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:48 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis after placement of a post-pyloric
 feeding tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Very mild interstitial abnormality, accompanying mild azygous distention could
 be due to edema, even though the heart has not enlarged.  Cluster of small
 nodular opacities in the right mid lung could be vessels on-end, or
 alternatively new areas of bronchiolar nodulation due to aspiration; however,
 I do not see any appreciable consolidation.  Heart size is normal and pleural
 effusion minimal if any.  Feeding tube passes through the upper stomach, where
 there is oral contrast agent, and out of view.
