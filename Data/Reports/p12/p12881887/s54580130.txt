                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.5 cm from the
 carina.  One enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach.  A second
 enteric tube is present with the tip out of the field of view, though likely
 in the postpyloric position.  A left internal jugular central venous catheter
 is present with the  tip in the low SVC.  Multiple surgical drains overlie the
 upper abdomen.  These are unchanged from the prior exam.
 
 Since the prior exam, the bibasilar opacities have improved, suggesting
 improved atelectasis.  There is no new focal airspace consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, grossly stable
 from prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
 2.  Improved bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Grossly stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
