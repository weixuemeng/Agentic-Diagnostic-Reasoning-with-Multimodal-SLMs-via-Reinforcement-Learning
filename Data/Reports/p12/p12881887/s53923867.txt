                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral basilar crackles and worsening ascites.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and more recent chest CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Previously, the left hemidiaphragm was slightly depressed
 compared to the right, but now with mild relative elevation instead. 
 Particularly that setting, streaky basilar opacities suggest atelectasis with
 volume loss.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity highly suggestive of atelectasis.  Infection
 is hard to exclude but less likely.
