                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Chin flexion
 obscures each medial lung apex. Streaky opacity at the left lung base suggests
 minor atelectasis. Calcified pleural plaque is noted along each hemidiaphragm.
 Few very small granulomas or additional small pleural calcification are
 suspected and unchanged in the right lung. Otherwise the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
