 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on hemodialysis  // rule out TB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chin flexion obscures the medial lung apices.  Calcified diaphragmatic and
 costal pleural plaques, most notable along the left costal pleura near the
 inferior angle of the left scapula, are unchanged.  Streaky opacity at the
 left lung base suggest atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of active or latent pulmonary tuberculosis.
