                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 compared to the prior study.  Previous pattern of pulmonary edema has
 improved.  Linear opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Previously noted pulmonary edema has nearly completely
 resolved.
