 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely due to improved inspiration.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  The structure of the
 lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or other
 pathological processes.  The lateral radiograph shows no evidence of pleural
 effusions.
