                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 Comparison radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The central pulmonary
 vessels appear more prominent in comparison to the prior radiograph, however,
 this most likely represents bronchovascular crowding in the setting of
 relatively lower lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pleural effusion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
