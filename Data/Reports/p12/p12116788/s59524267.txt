                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, immunosuppression.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 linear left basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis, although an early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Relative increasing haziness over the right hemithorax likely relates to
 overlying soft tissue.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
