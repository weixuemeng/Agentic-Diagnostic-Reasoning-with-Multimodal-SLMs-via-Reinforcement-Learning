                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man found down. Evaluate for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A single portable AP upright view of the chest was provided demonstrating
 increased opacity at the left lung base concerning for aspiration versus
 pneumonia. Given the associated volume loss in the left lower lung atelectasis
 also likely present. There may be an associated small pleural effusion. The
 right lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity at the left lung base likely represents a combination of atelectasis
 and aspiration/ pneumonia. Possible small left effusion.
