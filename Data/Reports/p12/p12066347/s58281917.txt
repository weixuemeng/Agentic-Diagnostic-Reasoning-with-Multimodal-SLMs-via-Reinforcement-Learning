 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status, clinically diagnosed with stroke 
 // eval for infection
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Diffuse
 bilateral interstitial markings along with the presence of Kerley B lines
 suggests interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is a 4 x 4mm dense opacity at
 the left lung base projecting over the left 8th rib, which may represent a
 calcified granuloma or a bone island. Heart size is top normal. No free air
 under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Prominent bilateral interstitial markings compatible with interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  4mm opacity projecting over the left 8th rib, which may represent a
 calcified granuloma vs bone island.
