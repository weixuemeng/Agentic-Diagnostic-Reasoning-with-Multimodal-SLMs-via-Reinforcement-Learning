                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough x 6 weeks and history of diabetes,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph earlier today
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained with improved inspiration.  The
 previously identified supra- and infrahilar right opacities have both
 normalized and likely reflected superimposition of normal vascular structures.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size,
 normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal study.
