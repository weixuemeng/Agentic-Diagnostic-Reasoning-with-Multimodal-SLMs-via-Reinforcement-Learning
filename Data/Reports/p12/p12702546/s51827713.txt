                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with complaint of abdominal and chest pain. 
 Evaluate for abdominal free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD. A focal patchy
 opacity in the right upper lung field projecting over the right fifth
 posterior rib is noted. Remainder of the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: No subdiaphragmatic free air. Focal patchy opacity in the right
 upper lung field is non-specific, but pneumonia is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
