                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ CHF, CKD, now symptomatic anemia  // pulmonary edema?
 worsening CHF?
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest from ___.  Prior chest
 radiograph from outside hospital also from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires are
 again noted as well as mediastinal clips.  Abnormal mediastinal contour
 reflects known mediastinal mass which per report likely represents thyroid
 goiter though clinical correlation is advised.  The heart appears top-normal
 in size.  There is mild hilar congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Top normal heart size.  Mild hilar congestion.  Mediastinal prominence, likely
 thyroid goiter though correlation with prior workup advised.
