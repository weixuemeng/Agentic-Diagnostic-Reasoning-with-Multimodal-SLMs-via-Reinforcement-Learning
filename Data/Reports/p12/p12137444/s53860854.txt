                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with previous right main stem bronchus intubation. 
 Assess for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates interval retraction of the
 endotracheal tube, which still remains in the right main stem bronchus.  There
 is interval improvement in left lung aeration.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely
 reflects atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Nasogastric tube is seen traversing through the
 esophagus and terminating in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube has been retracted but remains within the right main stem bronchus,
 and should be withdrawn another 5 to 6cm.  Left lung aeration has improved,
 but lower lobe still substantially collapsed.
