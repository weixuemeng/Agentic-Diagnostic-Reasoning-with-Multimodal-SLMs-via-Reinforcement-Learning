                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure, intubated, question tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest is provided.  The endotracheal
 tube is seen with its tip located approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.  NG
 tube courses inferiorly with its tip not visualized.  Lung volumes are low. 
 VP shunt catheter courses over the right hemithorax.  There is relative hilar
 prominence, likely reflecting crowded bronchovasculature.  The possibility of
 scattered atelectasis and aspiration is difficult to exclude.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube positioned low with tip 1.5 cm above carina.  Recommend
 retraction by at least 1 cm for more optimal placement.  NG tube positioned
 appropriately.  Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding and
 possible atelectasis/aspiration.
