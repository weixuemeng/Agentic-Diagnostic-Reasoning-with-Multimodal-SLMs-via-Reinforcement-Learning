                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p assault left rib pain  // eval for trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No definite displaced rib fracture is
 identified, however, this study is low in the sensitivity of detection of
 such.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  No definite
 rib fracture identified, however, if clinical concern remains high, dedicated
 rib series or chest CT is more sensitive.
