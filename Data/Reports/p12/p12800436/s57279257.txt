 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with STEMI, heavy smoker, diffuse wheezing,
 question emphysematous change.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison films can be helpful to
 detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs are relatively well inflated with no focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  There are some streaky linear opacities in the left
 costophrenic sulcus which may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or
 post-inflammatory scarring.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  More
 focal nodular appearance to the right hilum may reflect vascularity and
 overlapping shadows, but this can be better assessed on followup imaging.  The
 cardiac contour is within normal limits.  No acute bony abnormality
 appreciated.
