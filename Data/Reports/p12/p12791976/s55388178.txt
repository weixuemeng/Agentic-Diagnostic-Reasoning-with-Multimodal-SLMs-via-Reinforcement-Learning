                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malignant pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, chest CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Haziness over the right lower lung present on the prior study,
 likely re-expansion pulmonary edema, has resolved. However, there has been
 reaccumulation of right pleural fluid, resulting in a moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is limited by this effusion;
 however, the mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reaccumulation of right pleural effusion, now moderate.
