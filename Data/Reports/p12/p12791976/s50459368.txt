                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple films from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is increased opacity at the right
 lung base compared to most recent exam but significantly improved from earlier
 exam.  This is likely due to a combination of atelectasis and some residual
 pleural fluid.  The left lung remains clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild persistent right pleural effusion with underlying likely residual
 atelectasis in the right lower lung.
