                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis with progressive
 weakness of unclear etiology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is borderline enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance, unchanged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar patchy
 airspace opacities appear slightly progressed in the interval, which could
 reflect a combination of patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease
 with superimposed atelectasis, but progression of the patient's known chronic
 interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded.  There may be a small left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Worsening bibasilar parenchymal opacities could reflect
 progression of the patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease versus
 superimposed atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration is not completely excluded.
 Possible small left pleural effusion.
