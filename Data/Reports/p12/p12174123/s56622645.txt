                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung are volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 probably unchanged although cardiac borders are obscured by recurrent nearly
 confluent opacity involving the mid to left lower lung.  A new opacity in the
 right upper lobe suggests pneumonia. Volume loss has actually improved
 somewhat in the right lower lung, probably encroaching on the right middle
 lobe. Small subpulmonic effusions are not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Recurrent opacity in the left lower lung and new right upper lobe opacity
 concerning for pneumonia.
