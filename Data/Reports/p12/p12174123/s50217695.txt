                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The lung volumes
 are low.  Opacities are present at both lung bases but if anything somewhat
 more expanded compared to the prior studies at the left lung base.  There is a
 more coalescent band-like opacity at the right lung base but again overall
 fairly similar in extent relative to pre-existing opacification at the right
 lung base. There are no clearly defined pleural effusions although small very
 small ones would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting interstitial lung disease and areas of atelectasis or
 scarring at the lung bases.  Superimposed infection is not excluded but might
 not be the case noting that there was an overall fairly similar extent of
 basilar opacities on prior examinations.  Chest CT may be helpful to evaluate
 further if clinically indicated in addition to correlation with interval
 history.
