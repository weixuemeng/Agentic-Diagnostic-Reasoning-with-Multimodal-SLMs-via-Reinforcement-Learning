                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen and
 there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Relatively low lung volumes
 are seen with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Endotracheal tube tip
 is approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the inferior
 field of view with side port in the stomach.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears enlarged and is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and
 technique.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 Blunting of left costophrenic angle may also be due to possible effusion.
