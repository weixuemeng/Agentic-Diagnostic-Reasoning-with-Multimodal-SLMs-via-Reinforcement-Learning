                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified. 
 There is slight unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Lung markings are attenuated at the apices, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  The lungs appear clear however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of obstructive pulmonary disease.  No
 evidence of acute disease.
