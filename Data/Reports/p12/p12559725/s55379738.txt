                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is enlarged, more than just the exaggerated effect
 of AP positioning.  The pulmonary vasculature appears prominent with cephalic
 redistribution.  There are no consolidations.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with vascular congestion, compatible with early
 heart failure, but no evidence of pneumonia.
