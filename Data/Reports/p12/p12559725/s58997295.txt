                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is
 tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is normal and the hilar contours are stable. 
 Streaky linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormalities present. Scoliosis of the thoracic
 spine is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
