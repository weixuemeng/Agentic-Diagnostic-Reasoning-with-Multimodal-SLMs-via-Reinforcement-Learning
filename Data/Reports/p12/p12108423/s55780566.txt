                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiogenic shock, severe multi-vessel CAD
 s/p impella and swan placement  // impella, lines, tubes, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an Impella device which appears in satisfactory
 position.  The tip of the right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the
 the right pulmonary artery, projecting over the right hilum.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects 1.6 cm from the carina and could be retracted
 slightly.  A gastric tube is looped in the stomach.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Minimal right basilar atelectasis is present
 as well.  No pneumothorax identified.  The appearance of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter and Impella
 device as described above.
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 1.6 cm from the carina and could be
 retracted slightly.
