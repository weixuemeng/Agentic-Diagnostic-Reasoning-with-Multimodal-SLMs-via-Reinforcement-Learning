                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which
 appears mildly enlarged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
