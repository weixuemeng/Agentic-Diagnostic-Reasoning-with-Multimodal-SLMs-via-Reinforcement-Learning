 The endotracheal tube is situated at the mid trachea 2.5 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube terminates within the gastric body but the side port is just
 below the GE junction.  The lungs are well inflated and clear. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube well positioned at the mid trachea. No focal

 2.  Enteric tube terminates within the gastric body but the side port is below
 the GE junction.  Further advancement is recommended if the tube is used for
 feeding.
