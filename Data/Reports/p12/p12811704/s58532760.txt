                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  A patchy new right
 infrahilar opacity suggests pneumonia.  This appearance includes a new nodular
 opacity projecting over the lateral right mid lung and course of the right
 sicth and seventh ribs.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new right infrahilar and mid lung opacities suggesting
 pneumonia.  This includes a newly apparent nodular opacity projecting over the
 right mid lung, probably due to pneumonia although a new pulmonary nodule or
 sequelae of rib trauma could also be considered.
 
 Summary of final report including recommendation for follow-up radiographs
 within eight weeks emailed to ED QA nursing group at 6 pm on ___.
