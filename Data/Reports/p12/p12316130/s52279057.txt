                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures and pulmonary laceration, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a
 moderate right pneumothorax.  An area of increased opacification at the right
 base posteriorly could represent pulmonary contusion or even superimposed
 consolidation.
