                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post trauma with right rib fractures and a right lung
 laceration.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Right mid and lower lung opacities are
 increased from prior radiographs, and correspond with the pulmonary contusions
 seen on recent CT.  The right apical pneumothorax is decreased but still
 present.  There is no pleural effusion.  Multiple right rib fractures are
 again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decreased but persistent right apical pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Increased right mid and lower lung opacities, which correspond with
 pulmonary contusions seen on recent CT.
