 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph provided.  The left lung base
 is partially excluded and there is apparent retrocardiac opacity, which could
 reflect pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent retrocardiac opacity, which could reflect technique,
 though pneumonia not excluded.  Please confirm with dedicated PA and lateral
 views as needed.
