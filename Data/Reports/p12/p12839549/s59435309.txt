                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with shortness of breath and cough. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well expanded.  Slight increased in infrahilar airspace opacities
 with more indistinctness of the lateral border of the descending aorta and
 right heart border could indicate early bronchopneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical context.  No edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 normal in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  The descending thoracic
 aorta is slightly tortuous, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral increased infrahilar opacities can be seen with early
 bronchopneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation.  Follow-up radiograph
 in ___ weeks after treatment to ensure resolution is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up radiograph in ___ weeks after treatment to
 ensure resolution is recommended.
