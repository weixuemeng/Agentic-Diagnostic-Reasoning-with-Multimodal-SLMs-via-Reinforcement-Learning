                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and wheezing.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are assessed demonstrating interval potential
 increase in the cardiac silhouette.  Pericardial effusion might be a
 possibility.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations are
 present and need to be further assessed.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Bilateral pleural effusions that developed in the interim associated with
 bibasilar opacities, potentially may represent atelectasis or infection. 
 Increase in the cardiac silhouette; correlation with echocardiography is
 recommended to exclude the possibility of pericardial effusion.
