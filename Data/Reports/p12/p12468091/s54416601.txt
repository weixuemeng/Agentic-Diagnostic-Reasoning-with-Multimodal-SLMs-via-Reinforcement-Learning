                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate nasogastric
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is bibasilar atelectasis,
 which is not significantly changed from the prior study.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  The mediastinum remains stably widened.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 with the tip ending in the stomach and the last side port above the GE
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach with the last side port
 above the GE junction, and should be advanced prior to use.
