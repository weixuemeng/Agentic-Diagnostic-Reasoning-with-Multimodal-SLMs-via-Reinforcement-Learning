 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 11:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  Lungs are diminished in
 volume but the parenchymal distortion is once again seen consistent with known
 underlying emphysema.  There has been interval appearance of patchy opacity in
 the retrocardiac area which more likely reflects atelectasis, although
 aspiration and developing pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with the heart
 being stably enlarged.
