                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent trach change in shortness of breath, evaluate for
 tracheostomy placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Despite hyperinflation, moderately severe left and milder right lower lobe
 atelectasis are chronic, accompanied by persistent small pleural effusions. 
 Heart is top-normal size.  Tubing min projecting over the right upper lobe
 obscures bronchiectasis, seen to better advantage on subsequent chest
 radiographs.
 
 New tracheostomy tube is oriented obliquely and the cuff is overinflated.  It
 should be evaluated clinically to see if it is appropriately positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION:
