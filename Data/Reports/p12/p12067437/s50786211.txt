                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:06 p.m.
 
 Rotated positioning. A tracheostomy is in place.    There is increased
 retrocardiac density, likely reflecting left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  An unusual curvilinear rim-like density overlies the lower
 chest anteriorly.  This is not fully characterized and could conceivably
 relate to something outside the patient, but raises a question of
 calcification in relation to a left ventricular aneurysm, though seen only on
 the lateral view.  No CHF or right-sided infiltrate.  Small right effusion
 versus pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy.  
 
 2.  Probable left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, not fully
 characterized.
 
 3. Small amount of right pleural fluid or thickening.  Right lung otherwise
 grossly clear.
 
 4.  Possible rim-like cardiac calcification raising the question of a
 calcified left ventricular aneurysm.  Addendum --  Review of a ___
 abdominal CT, which included the lower portion of the heart, demonstrates no
 ventricular calcification.  This suggests that the findings on today's exam
 may represent an artifact.
