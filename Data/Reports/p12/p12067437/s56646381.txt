                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tracheostomy, respiratory distress
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted with bibasilar airspace opacities which
 may reflect atelectasis.  Infection, particularly in the left lung base,
 cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is clearly seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.  An apparent right-sided PICC appears coiled
 within the right axillary region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, in the left lung base is not completely
 excluded.
 2. Apparent right-sided PICC appears coiled in the right axilla.
