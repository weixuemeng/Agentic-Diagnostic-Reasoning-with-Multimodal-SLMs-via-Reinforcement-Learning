                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, history of AS, assess pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph provided.  There is a linear
 metallic density projecting in the right axilla, which was also seen on prior
 radiographs and is concerning for a retained foreign body.  A tracheostomy
 tube is noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  There
 is increased retrocardiac opacity which could reflect suboptimal penetration,
 though the possibility of left lower lobe consolidation is not excluded. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and possible left lower lobe
 consolidation which is somewhat difficult to assess given underpenetrated
 technique.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views for further assessment.
 2.  Metallic linear density within the soft tissues of the right axilla
 appears to represent a foreign body and was seen on the prior radiograph dated
 ___ but not on the previous radiograph dated ___.  Please correlate
 for interventions in this region and associated symptoms.
