                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, head strike and shoulder pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with calcification of
 the aortic knob re- demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy opacity is noted within the right upper lung field, which appears new
 compared to the previous exams.  Retrocardiac opacity could reflect
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen though a small left pleural
 effusion cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy opacity within the right upper lung field which appears new
 compared to the previous exam.  This is a nonspecific finding and could be
 related to inflammation or infection.
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis.  A trace left pleural
 effusion is not excluded.
