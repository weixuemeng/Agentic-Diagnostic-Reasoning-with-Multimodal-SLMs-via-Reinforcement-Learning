                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the left.  The previously seen left-sided PICC is relatively
 similar in appearance.  Left base opacity is new since the prior study and is
 worrisome for consolidation due to pneumonia with possible small pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Lower lung
 volumes on the current study as compared to the prior.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia.
