 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.  Evaluate PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC catheter terminates 4 cm caudal to the carina and
 the distal SVC.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Biapical
 scarring is unchanged.  Pleural surfaces are otherwise clear without effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Adequate positioning of a left-sided PICC within the distal SVC.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
