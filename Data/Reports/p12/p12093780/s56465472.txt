                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a
 newly appeared mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  On the right, the
 effusion is small and only appreciated on the lateral radiograph.  Unchanged
 is the appearance of the large hiatal hernia and of the cardiac silhouette. 
 As a consequence of the left effusion, retrocardiac atelectasis is seen.  The
 transparency of the lung parenchyma is otherwise normal.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged hilar
 structures.
