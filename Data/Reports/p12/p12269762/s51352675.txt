                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ongoing fevers.  The patient has a
 history of ovarian cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A right chest port is unchanged, with catheter extending via a transsubclavian
 approach to the mid SVC.
 
 Prior lingular and left basilar opacities have improved, with decreased
 air-bronchograms and decreased tram-tracking, though some opacity persists,
 particularly in the left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly.  Remainder of the
 lungs remain well aerated.  There is new opacity.  There is no effusion and
 there is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Surgical clips are seen
 in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving left basilar and lingular pneumonia.  No new opacity,
 and no effusion, cavitary lesion or pneumothorax.  Continued radiographic
 followup to resolution is recommended.
