 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is dense consolidation of the right lung base,

 correlation with clinical symptoms is advised.  Remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  There is at least a small pleural effusion on the right. No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is enlarged.

 Dense right lung base opacity with an associated effusion.  This could
 represent pneumonia in the setting of infectious symptoms, although malignancy
 could have a similar radiographic appearance.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended, and a chest radiograph should be repeated in 4 weeks, if
 cross-sectional imaging is not warranted earlier.
