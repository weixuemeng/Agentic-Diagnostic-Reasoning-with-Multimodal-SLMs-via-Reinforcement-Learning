                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, history of interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Hardware partially imaged in the
 cervical spine.  There is mild interval progression of interstitial lung
 disease with slightly increased peripheral reticulation as compared with most
 recent prior imaging studies.  Difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia
 though none is clearly seen.  No large effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear grossly
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial fibrosis, minimally progressed without definite signs of
 superimposed pneumonia.
