 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain, hematuria, chills, diarrhea.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes persist.  Again seen are bilateral interstitial
 opacities, right greater than left, with a relative peripheral distribution,
 in keeping with interstitial fibrosis.  Findings are without significant
 interval change since the prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Surgical hardware
 is partially imaged in the partially imaged cervical spine, image portion is
 grossly stable in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Interstitial fibrosis without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
