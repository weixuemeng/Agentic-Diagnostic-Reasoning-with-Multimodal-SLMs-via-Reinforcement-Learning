                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate persistent left upper lobe
 consolidation, unchanged since the prior study, with fibronodular opacities in
 both apices and superior hilar retraction.  Additionally, subcentimeter
 calcified rounded nodular opacities in the right upper lobe and juxta-hilar
 left lung are unchanged, compatible with granuloma.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia is identified. There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute process. Findings compatible with the sequelae of prior TB.
