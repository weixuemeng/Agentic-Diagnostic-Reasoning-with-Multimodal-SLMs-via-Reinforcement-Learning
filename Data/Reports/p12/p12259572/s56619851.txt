                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with leukocytosis and anemia, rule out adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 An oval ring shadow projecting to the left of the lower-most thoracic
 vertebral body above the left hemidiaphragm is not localized on the lateral
 view.  It could be a small epiphrenic diverticulum of the esophagus.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear, cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  There is, however, an outside possibility that it
 represents a small cavitated lung nodule or abscess, and therefore, I would
 recommend routine oblique views to try to localize it.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 5:05 p.m., one minute after the findings were
 recognized, to report the findings; findings were then posted on the
 electronic record of important imaging findings for notification of the
 referring physician ___.
