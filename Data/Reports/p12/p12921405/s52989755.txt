 HISTORY:  
 
 Cough, fever, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size remains unchanged, appearing borderline
 enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There is mild crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 Patchy opacities are demonstrated in both lung bases, more pronounced in the
 left, which may reflect areas of aspiration or infection.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Remote right-sided rib fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are concerning for
 areas of infection or aspiration, more pronounced in the left lung base.
