                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, questionable pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing parenchymal
 opacities have slightly increased in extent and severity.  The asymmetric
 distribution and morphology favors pneumonia over pulmonary edema, as already
 described in yesterday's report.  The lung volumes remain low, borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
