                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:30 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with crackles and increased oxygen requirement,
 evaluate possible pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 Pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___ and subsequently
 worsened.  Since then, major changes have been greater opacification at the
 lung bases and radiographically one cannot distinguish between combination of
 dependent edema and atelectasis with the development of concurrent pneumonia. 
 The cardiac configuration favors a very large left atrium.  Mild edema is
 still present in the upper lungs, and pleural effusions are presumed, but not
 large.  No pneumothorax.
