                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with altered mental status as per son today, history of
 lymphoma, diabetes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Low lung volumes limits the evaluation due to bronchovascular crowding. 
 Paramediastinal fibrosis likely in part accounts for poor definition of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The heart size is difficult to assess given low
 lung volumes.  No large consolidation effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Given
 the ill definition of the pulmonary hila difficult to exclude a component of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No overt edema.  Bony structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Consider
 repeat radiograph to better assess with more optimal inspiratory effort.
