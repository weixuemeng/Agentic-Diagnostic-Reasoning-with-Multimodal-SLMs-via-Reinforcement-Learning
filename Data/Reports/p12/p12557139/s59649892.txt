 hx of lymphoma and recent right middle lobe pneumonia. With persistent cough.
 Please re-evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right middle lobe consolidation has nearly resolved with minimal residual
 opacity remaining.  Paramediastinal areas of radiation fibrosis are unchanged,
 and intrathoracic lymph node enlargement is similar to recent CT allowing for
 technical differences between the studies.  Heart size remains normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  Known skeletal lesions are shown to better detail on
 recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near resolution of right middle lobe pneumonia.  No new areas of
 consolidation.
