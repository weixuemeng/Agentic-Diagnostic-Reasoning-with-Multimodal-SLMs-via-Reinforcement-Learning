                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post CABG with chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 17:34.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 15:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation, removal of the nasogastric tube, removal of
 mediastinal drains and removal of left basilar chest tube.  Right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the distal superior vena cava, unchanged.
 
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities and a probable
 layering left effusion.  These findings likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Status post median sternotomy with
 stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
