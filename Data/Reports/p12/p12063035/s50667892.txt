                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cholecystitis, new O2 requirement, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  There is moderate to moderately
 severe cardiomegaly with a calcified aorta, unchanged compared with ___ at
 19:42 p.m.  Prominence of the right paratracheal density is consistent with
 vascular ectasia in someone of this age.  There are diffuse increased
 interstitial markings, more pronounced than on prior film.  Although this
 could also represent a background increased interstitial change, the interval
 increase is compatible with interstitial edema.  There is a small left
 effusion, similar to the prior film, with somewhat increased left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  A small right effusion seen on the CT from one
 day earlier is not visible on this radiograph due to obscuration of the
 posterior sulcus.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD and cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Interval increase in interstitial markings compared with one day earlier,
 suggestive of CHF with interstitial edema.
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion may
 be slightly worse.
