                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute onset shortness of breath, question worsening edema,
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:12 p.m.
 
 There is severe background COPD and moderately severe cardiomegaly.  There are
 diffusely increased interstitial markings.  These are similar, possibly
 slightly worse, compared with earlier the same day.  Again seen is increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles is consistent with small
 bilateral effusions.  Atelectasis at the right base is probably slightly
 worse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with interstitial edema, probably slightly worse compared
 with earlier the same day.  Right base atelectasis also slightly worse.  Left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation unchanged.  Small bilateral
 effusions, minimally increased on the right.
