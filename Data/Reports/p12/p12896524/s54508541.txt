                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, low-grade fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear within normal limits.  However,
 on the lateral view, there is slight loss of the retrosternal clear space,
 which in a patient of this age may represent a small amount of residual thymic
 tissue.  There are no focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The osseous structures remarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 2.  Slight decrease in the retrosternal clear space may represent residual
 thymic tissue in a patient of this age.
