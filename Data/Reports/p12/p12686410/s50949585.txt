                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right MCA bleed, evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina, orogastric tube courses
 below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriately positioned. 
 Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities are persisting.  Left hemithorax is less
 opaque than it was yesterday, but whether this is due to differences from
 layering of left pleural effusion and position or true decrease in the lung
 opacities is difficult to differentiate. Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral diffuse lung opacities are persisting concerning for
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Improvement in the left hemithorax
 opacity could be due to difference in layering of the small effusion and
 position or could be a true decrease in the opacities.
