                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient status post intubation with intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed and terminates approximately 4
 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube passes into the stomach, its distal
 course not imaged.  The heart is normal in size.  There is asymmetric left
 perihilar opacification, with mild right perhilar haziness, but otherwise the
 lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid portion of the trachea.  
 
 2.  Left perihilar opacification with milder hazy right perihilar
 opacification.  Considerations include asymmetric edema, versus pneumonia or
 even potentially retrohilar opacification associated with aspiration, which
 could also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term
 followup radiographs are suggested.
