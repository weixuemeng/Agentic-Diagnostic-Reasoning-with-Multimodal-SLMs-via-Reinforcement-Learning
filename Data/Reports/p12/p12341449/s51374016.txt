                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes, which
 accentuate the bronchovascular markings, given this, there is subtle patchy
 right mid-to-lower lung opacity which could be due to pneumonia.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is again seen.  There is prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature which may be due to vascular engorgement/mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours
 are stable with calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  More focal patchy opacity in the
 right mid-to-lower lung could be due to consolidation from infection or
 aspiration.
