  Low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Again seen are
  subtle bibasilar opacities, subtly more conspicuous on the current exam, which
  may be due to atelectasis however aspiration or infection should be
  considered. No pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dementia now s/p syncope  // eval for pna
 vs. fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The patient has had prior median sternotomy. Sternotomy
 wires are intact and aligned. An ill-defined opacity at the left lung base may
 be due to infection or atelectasis. The heart and mediastinum are within
 normal limits despite the projection.  There is generalized osteopenia.  No
 displaced rib fracture is identified.  Metallic right upper quadrant clips
 denote prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined opacity at the left lung base may be due to infection or
 atelectasis.
 
 No evidence of displaced rib fracture. An upright PA radiograph or dedicated
 rib series would provide more sensitive evaluation for rib fracture.
