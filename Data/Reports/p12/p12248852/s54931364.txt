 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:14 PM
  Markedly diminished lung volumes compared to yesterday.  Mild pulmonary edema
  may have worsened from yesterday but at least some of the increased diffuse
  opacity is related to the lower lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity appears
  increased, at least in part due to a left pleural effusion.

  Markedly diminished lung volumes compared to yesterday.  Mild pulmonary edema
  may have worsened from yesterday but at least some of the increased diffuse
  opacity is related to the lower lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity appears
  increased, which may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate
  clinical setting.
