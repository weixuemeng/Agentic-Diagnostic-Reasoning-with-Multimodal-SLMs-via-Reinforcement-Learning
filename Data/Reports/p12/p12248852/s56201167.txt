                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Orthopnea, shortness of breath, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ earlier the same date at 12:58.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Prominence of the
 central vasculature is also seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarge.  The combination of the above raises concern for CHF.  There
 is also subtle opacity in the retrocardiac region which may relate to
 prominent vasculature, but in the appropriate clinical setting, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
