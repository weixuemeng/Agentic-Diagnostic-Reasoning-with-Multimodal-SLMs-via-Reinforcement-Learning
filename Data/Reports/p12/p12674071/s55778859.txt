                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with throat tightness and dyspnea.  He quit smoking
 ___ years ago.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe pulmonary fibrosis, has been progressing since ___, now severe in the
 mid and lower lung zones.  Heart size is normal and unchanged.  There has been
 a slight increase in fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle, which could
 be due to lymph node enlargement or azygous distention because of elevated
 central venous pressure.
 
 There are no features about this condition to elevate sarcoidosis as the
 likely cause, but that does not exclude the diagnosis, particularly since
 there appears to be adenopathy in the left hilus and perhaps AP window.  I
 attempted to reach Dr. ___ by telephone and reached answering service
 instead.
