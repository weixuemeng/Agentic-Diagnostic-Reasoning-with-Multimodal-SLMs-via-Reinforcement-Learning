                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Colonic distention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, as before.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, as before, with increased pleural effusion.  Small pleural
 effusion on the left is similar to decreased, however.  Similar patchy
 retrocardiac opacities probably due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate suspected right-sided pleural effusion with increase.
