                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chills, sweating, productive cough, history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms and an increased AP
 diameter, as also seen on the prior study, consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Some degenerative changes are again seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
