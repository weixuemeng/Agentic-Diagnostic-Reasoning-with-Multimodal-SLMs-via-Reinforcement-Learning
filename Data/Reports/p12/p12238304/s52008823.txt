                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure,
 "cpd" or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and CTA torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 Leftward shift of the heart is chronic.  The aorta is calcified. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A left pleural effusion is small.
 There is no pneumothorax. Although partially visualized there are notable
 degenerative changes in the right shoulder. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic leftward shift of the heart. Small left pleural effusion
 but no evidence of pneumonia. A lateral radiograph would be helpful for more
 definitive evaluation.
