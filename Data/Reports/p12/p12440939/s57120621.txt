                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M w/ sub-aortic stenosis and suspected secondary CHF, AI,
 Strep Galloliticus (Strep Bovis Biotype 2) bacteremia in ___, and recent
 admission for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure p/w failure to thrive
 found to be profoundly anemic with acute kidney injury   unexplained

 acute process vs pulmonary edema  r/o acute process vs pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion.
 This suggests cardiomyopathy or possibly pericardial effusion. Opacification
 at the left base obscuring the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and possible small pleural effusion.
