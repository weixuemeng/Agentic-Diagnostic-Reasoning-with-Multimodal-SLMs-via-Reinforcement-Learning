 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A previously present right lower lobe pneumonia has completely
 resolved.  The current image shows signs of mild-to-moderate overinflation and
 bilateral apical scarring, which is symmetrical, and combined to minimal right
 apical calcifications.  Currently, there is no evidence of acute changes in
 the lung parenchyma, in particular no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  The
 contour of the hilar and mediastinal structures is unchanged and normal.
