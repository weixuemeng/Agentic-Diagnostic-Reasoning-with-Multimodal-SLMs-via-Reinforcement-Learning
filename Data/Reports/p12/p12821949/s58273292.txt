                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post transthoracic lung biopsy, for assessment of
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT earlier same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Innumerable pulmonary nodules are seen within the right and left
 lung.  There is confluent opacity projecting over the region of the left
 hilum, most compatible with underlying tumor.  
 
 The heart and mediastinal structures are within normal limits.  
 
 Bilaterally, the pleural spaces are clear.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  
 
 The spine demonstrates thoracic levoscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple pulmonary nodules as well as a dominant nodule within
 the left hilar region compatible with the patient's known metastatic neoplasm,
 with likely a lung primary.  Status post biopsy, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
