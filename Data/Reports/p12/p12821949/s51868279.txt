 HISTORY:  Tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  The gastric tube extends
 well into the stomach with the side hole far beyond the esophagogastric
 junction.  Otherwise, little change.
