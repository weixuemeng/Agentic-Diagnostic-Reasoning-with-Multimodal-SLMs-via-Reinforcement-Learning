                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough and shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Questionable opacity adjacent to
 the left cardiac border is noted, approximately 2 cm in diameter.  It might
 reflect infectious process, but pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  In
 addition, there is relative density projecting over the right clavicle at the
 mid aspect, 12 mm in diameter.
 
 Evaluation of the patient in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy
 is required for assessment of resolution.  If no typical history of pneumonia
 is present, assessment with chest CT would be appropriate for precise
 characterization of the right upper and left pericardiac areas.
