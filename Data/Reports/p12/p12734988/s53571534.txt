                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume
 but clear aside from left basal atelectasis.  Haziness in the costophrenic
 sulci bilaterally is likely due to obscuration and artifact due to body
 habitus rather than effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is
 top-normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
