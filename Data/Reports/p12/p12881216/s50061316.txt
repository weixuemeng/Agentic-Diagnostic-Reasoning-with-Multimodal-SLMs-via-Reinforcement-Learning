 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small areas of peribronchial opacification at the left lung base are new, seen
 only on the frontal view.  Lateral view is more suggestive of bronchiectasis. 
 Findings are presumably due to infection, but I am not sure this is pneumonia.
 I would follow these abnormalities with conventional chest radiographs, but CT
 scanning may ultimately be necessary.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If symptoms persist, conventional radiographs should be
 repeated in ___ weeks.
