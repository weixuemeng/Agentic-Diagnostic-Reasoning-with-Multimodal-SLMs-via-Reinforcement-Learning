                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, cirrhosis, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lung volumes
 are low which limits the evaluation.  Since the prior exam, the subtle opacity
 at the left lung base has cleared.  There is minimal left basilar linear
 density which is most compatible with atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air is seen
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal residual left basilar atelectasis with resolution of
 previously noted consolidation.
