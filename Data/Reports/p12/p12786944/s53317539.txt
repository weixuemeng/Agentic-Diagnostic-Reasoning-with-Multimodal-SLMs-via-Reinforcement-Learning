                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with liver disease, presents with altered mental
 status.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for such, there is
 no confluent consolidation to definitely suggest pneumonia.  There is
 subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.  No pneumothorax, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the left base.
 2.  Low lung volumes accentuating bronchovascular crowding, without confluent
 consolidation.
