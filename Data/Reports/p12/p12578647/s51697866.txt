  lower lung volumes with dense opacity at left base. this could be explained by
  new pleural effusion and atelectasis though a consolidation or PE could be
  present. possible mild volume overload. no pneumothorax. left IJ catheter and
  ETT have been removed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:51 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with fulminant liver and renal failure.  Hypoxic and
 tachycardic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right and large left pleural effusion has increased, worsening
 bibasilar atelectasis to the point of collapse on the left and making it
 difficult to determine whether mild pulmonary edema has developed in the
 setting of severe vascular crowding.  Right internal jugular sheath ends in
 the right atrium, and a feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of view.
 No pneumothorax.  Heart size is indeterminate because of adjacent pleural and
 parenchymal opacification, but probably not substantially enlarged.
