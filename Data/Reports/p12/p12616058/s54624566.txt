                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___:
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is correlated to CT scan of the
 abdomen from earlier the same day performed at an outside hospital.  There are
 bibasilar opacities, larger on the left than on the right which partially
 silhouette the hemidiaphragms.  There is engorgement of the central pulmonary
 vasculature and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen peripherally. 
 Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  Degenerative changes noted at the right
 shoulder and acromioclavicular joint.  Surgical clips seen in the left axilla.
 Partially visualized abdominal aortic stent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure.  Left greater than
 right basilar opacities compatible with effusion and underlying atelectasis
 although component of infection is not excluded.
