                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post VATS, right upper lobe lobectomy, now chest tube
 removal.  Question pneumothorax, change in right middle lobe atelectasis.  
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the right-sided chest tube has been removed.  A
 thin linear density is noted in the right lung apex -- this is equivocal for a
 small pneumothorax, as the line is straight rather than curved. Clips again
 noted adjacent to the upper trachea on the right.     Atelectasis and pleural
 fluid in the right lung are again seen, with slight improvement in the right
 middle lobe findings.  Probable slight volume loss on the right, unchanged. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema over the upper right chest wall also again noted,
 similar to the prior film.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  The left lung is grossly
 clear, without focal consolidation or effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left base appears improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interval removal of right chest tube.  ? small right apical pneumothorax. 
 Alternatively, the presumed line of demarcation may represent artifact. 
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  
 
 2.  Slight interval improvement in patchy opacity previously seen in the right
 middle lobe.
 
 3.  Suspect mild prominence of the right hilum, unchanged.
