                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Overlapping of bony structures makes it difficult to assess the previously
 described tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with the pulmonary vascularity essentially within normal limits. 
 Retrocardiac opacification at the left base is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
 
 Central catheter is unchanged in position.
