                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with postop bleeding. Study requested
 for evaluation of interval change in pulmonary volume status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Cardiac size remains unchanged. There has been complete reaeration
 of the right upper lobe.  A dense streak is again seen along the normal
 position of the minor fissure. There are lower lung volumes. Increased 
 opacification at the left lung base is consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax.  The monitoring and support devices
 remain in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complete reaeration of right upper lobe with unchanged lower lung
 volumes.
