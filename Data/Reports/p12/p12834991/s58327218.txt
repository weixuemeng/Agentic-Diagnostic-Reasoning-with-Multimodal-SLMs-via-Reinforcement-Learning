                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Adrenal hemorrhage and abdominal pain.  Now fever, question
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is focal patchy opacity at the left
 lung base, partially obscuring the cardiac silhouette and left diaphragm.  The
 appearance is consistent with a left base pneumonia.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, aspiration pneumonitis could have a similar appearance.  
 
 Allowing for low lung volumes, the right lung is grossly clear, without CHF,
 focal infiltrate or effusion.  Possibility of a small left effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by
 low inspiratory volumes.  
 
 There is a prominent air-filled loop of apparent small bowel in the left upper
 abdomen.  However, no dilated loops of small bowel were seen on the CT from
 ___, and this may be exaggerated by technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity at left base.  The ddx could include an aspiration
 pneumonitis.
