 terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The transesophageal tube
 side port terminates near the GE junction.  Bilateral patchy opacities are
 noted, worse on the left than on the right, in the appropriate clinical
 context, possibly related to possibly aspiration, multifocal pneumonia,
 hemorrhage.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy bilateral opacities, worse on the left than on the right,
 differential diagnosis include multifocal pneumonia, massive aspiration,
 hemorrhage.
 2. The transesophageal tube side port terminates near the GE junction. 
 Consider advancement.
