                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy better seen in
 prior CT should be followed after the acute illness in 3 months with CT. 
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction.  NG tube tip is not
 visualized but the side port appears to be in the lower esophagus and should
 be advanced for more standard position.  Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the
 left side are grossly unchanged.  More irregular ill-defined opacities in the
 left mid lung are worrisome for aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Advancement of the NG tube
 
 FOLLOWUP CT IN 3 MONTHS TO RE-EVALUATE THE MEDIASTINAL AND HILAR
 LYMPHADENOPATHY
