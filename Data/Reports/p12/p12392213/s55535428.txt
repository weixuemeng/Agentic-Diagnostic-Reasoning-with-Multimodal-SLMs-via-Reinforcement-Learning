                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:59 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic lung carcinoma, admitted for pain. 
 Question acute aspiration of emesis.  New hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is a new large right pleural effusion which has probably developed
 chronically since there is no contralateral mediastinal shift.  This
 abnormality is accompanied by greater atelectasis in the right upper lobe
 where a large mass was seen previously, and obscures the contours of the
 heart, right hilus and mediastinum.  At the base of the left lung is a large
 region of new infiltration consisting of tiny and small lung nodules,
 irregular small opacities as well as a generalized increase in background
 density of the lung.  This may well be acute aspiration pneumonia.  Heart is
 not enlarged.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings by telephone 3:40 p.m., two minutes
 after findings were recognized.
