 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within
 normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.  Blunting of 1
 of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggests either
 pleural fluid or its scarring.  There is a dense streak of atelectasis at the
 left base and a moderate streaky in the right mid zone.  However, no evidence
 of acute focal pneumonia.
