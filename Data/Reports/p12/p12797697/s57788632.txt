                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluate
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The heart is normal in size, and there is no pulmonary edema.  There is an
 enteric tube which terminates in the stomach.  Gaseous distention of bowel
 loops in the upper abdomen is compatible with known small bowel obstruction
 seen on the same day CT.  Right upper quadrant abdominal surgical clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube terminating in the stomach.  Dilated bowel loops in the upper
 abdomen reflect known small bowel obstruction as seen on the same day CT.
