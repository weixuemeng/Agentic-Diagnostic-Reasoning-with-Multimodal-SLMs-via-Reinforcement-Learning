                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph, there is still redemonstration of left
 perihilar opacity, potentially even more pronounced than on the current study
 and potentially representing atelectasis.  There is most likely presence of
 the left main bronchus stent.  No pneumothorax is seen.
