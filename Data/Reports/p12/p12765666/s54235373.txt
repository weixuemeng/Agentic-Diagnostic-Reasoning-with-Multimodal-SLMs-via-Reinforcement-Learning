                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post bronchoscopy.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest is highly limited due to
 underpenetration.  Allowing for such, no pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly prominent, but likely accentuated by
 low lung volumes and AP technique.  Assessment of the lungs is limited, but
 retrocardiac opacities persist.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam demonstrating no obvious pneumothorax.
