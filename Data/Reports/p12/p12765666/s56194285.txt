                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic RCC, intubated, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.9 cm above the carina at the level
 of the midclavicular heads, unchanged.  An NG tube is present, not traced
 beyond the level of the proximal mediastinum due to underpenetration.  
 
 Again seen is complete opacification of the left lung.  The mediastinum
 remains grossly midline.  On the right, there are low inspiratory volumes,
 likely accounting for mild prominence of the upper zone vessels and some
 patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  The right lower chest wall
 and cardiophrenic angle are excluded from the film.  Allowing for this, no
 gross right-sided effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change compared with ___ at 3:40
 a.m.
