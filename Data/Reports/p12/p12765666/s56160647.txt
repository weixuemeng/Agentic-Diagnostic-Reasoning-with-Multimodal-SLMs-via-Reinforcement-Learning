 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:56 PM
  Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with the left hemidiaphragm
  elevation with left-sided mediastinal shift.  This is likely a combination of
  total left lung collapse and effusion.  Consideration should also be given to
  hemothorax given density as well as history of malignancy.  The right lung is
  essentially clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Complete collapse of the left lung is new compared to the prior
 radiograph.  Right lung is slightly overexpanded but grossly clear, and there
 is no evidence of right pleural effusion.  Known T9 vertebral body lytic
 lesion and small pulmonary nodules are seen to better detail on recent CT of
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complete collapse of left lung with associated abrupt termination
 of left main bronchus, likely primarily due to acute mucus plugging given
 rapid development of collapse since recent CT.  As discussed with Dr. ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 7:45 a.m. at the time of discovery, bronchoscopy
 would be helpful for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, particularly
 given the presence of soft tissue thickening and irregularity of this bronchus
 on recent CT.
