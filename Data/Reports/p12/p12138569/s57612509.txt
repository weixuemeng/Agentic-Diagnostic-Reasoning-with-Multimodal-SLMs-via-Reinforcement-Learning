                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:05
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with desaturation status post laparoscopic
 cholecystectomy, assess for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest film of ___ at 13:43.
 
 Portable upper chest film ___ at 4:05 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of patchy opacities at
 both bases, which likely reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia
 should also be considered.  There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature,
 most likely related to the low lung volumes with no evidence of overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable given portable technique and
 differences in patient positioning.
