                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:40 P.M., ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with cirrhosis.  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest, submitted for review on ___, compared to
 ___.  A series of four chest radiographs show sequential positioning of
 feeding tube in the trachea, at the right lower lobe bronchial tree, the mid
 esophagus, and finally in the stomach.
 
 Right lower lobe consolidation has not cleared over the preceding several
 days, most likely pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, but pulmonary
 vascular congestion has persisted.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. 
 Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.  Right posterior rib
 fractures are probably chronic and healed.
