 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Spontaneous left pneumothorax, removal of the chest tube.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube has
 been removed.  A small left apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension
 continues to be visible.  In addition, the lateral radiograph shows mild areas
 of atelectasis at the bases of both the lingula and the left lower lobe.  No
 changes in appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the right lung.
