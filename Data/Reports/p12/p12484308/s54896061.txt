                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intoxicated with evidence of head trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal AP view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal allowing for low lung
 volumes and technique.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.  There is no free air
 under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process allowing for lung volumes.
