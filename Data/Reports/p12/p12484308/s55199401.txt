                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Overlying EKG leads are present. 
 Underpenetration somewhat limits assessment.  There is minimal linear density
 in the region of the left lower lobe which may represent mild left lower lobe
 atelectasis, difficult to exclude an early pneumonia.  Right lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle streaky opacity in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis versus
 early pneumonia.
