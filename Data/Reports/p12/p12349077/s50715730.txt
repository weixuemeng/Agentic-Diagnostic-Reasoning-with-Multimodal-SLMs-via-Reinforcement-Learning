                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a new opacity in the right lower lung, probably within the right
 lower lobe, which may reflect the recent history of pneumonia.  Streaky
 opacities are present in the left lower lung, probably in the lingula,
 suggestive of scarring or atelectasis and unchanged, while a previously seen
 opacity in the left lower lobe has mostly resolved.  There may be trace
 pleural effusions, but reduced and perhaps resolved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right basilar opacity for which pneumonia could be considered,
 although the chronicity is uncertain, noting the given history, but it is new
 since the prior available radiographs from this institution.  Atelectasis or
 pneumonia could be considered.
 
 2.  Resolving left lower lung opacity.
