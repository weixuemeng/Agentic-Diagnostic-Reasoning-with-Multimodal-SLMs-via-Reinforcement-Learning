                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pneumonia with
 increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided PICC is seen, distal aspect not well appreciated, but likely
 terminating in the region of the mid-SVC.  In the interval since the prior
 study, there has been development of consolidation in the left lower lobe and
 extending into the lingula.  The blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 concerning for a small pleural effusion.  Subtle right basal opacity is
 similar to possibly minimally improved as compared to the prior study.  In the
 interval since the prior study, the hila appears slightly more prominent. 
 Barium is seen in the partially visualized colon in the upper abdomen from
 recent prior barium study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lingular and left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia, new since the prior study.  New small left pleural effusion. 
 Subtle right basal opacity similar compared to prior.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
