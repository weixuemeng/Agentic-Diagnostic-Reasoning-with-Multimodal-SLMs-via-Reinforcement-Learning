                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post cardiac arrest with witnessed seizures and
 multiple other medical problems.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FRONTAL PORTABLE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.1 cm above the carina. 
 Nasoenteric tube extends to the stomach with the tip out of view. Today there
 are symmetric bibasilar consolidations, previously only on the left, but now
 at both lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable with decreased mediastinal
 vascular congestion and no substantial pleural effusions. The progression of
 the lung abnormality in the setting of improving cardiac function suggests
 that the consolidation is not due to cardiogenic edema, but is concerning for
 aspiration or pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for developing pneumonia.
