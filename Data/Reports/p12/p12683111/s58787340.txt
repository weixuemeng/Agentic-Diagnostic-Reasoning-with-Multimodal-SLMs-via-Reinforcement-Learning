                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post arrest, evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Initial images done at 11:34 a.m. demonstrate an endotracheal tube
 within the right main bronchus as well as left retrocardiac opacity consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air.
 An enteric catheter ends in the distal esophagus.  
 
 Subsequent images at 11:47 a.m. demonstrate the ET tube in appropriate
 position, 3 cm from the carina and resolution of the left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidations are seen.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion. Enteric catheter again ends in the distal esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube initially in right main stem bronchus, subsequently
 pulled back in appropriate position, with resolution of left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly. Entertic tube tip in distal esophagus and
 needs to be advanced.
