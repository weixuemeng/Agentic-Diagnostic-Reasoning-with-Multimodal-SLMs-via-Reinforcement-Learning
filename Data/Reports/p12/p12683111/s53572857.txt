  Althought the left hemidiaphragm is better seen, likely from improved
  atelectasis, there is now a more diffuse opacity in the left lower lobe. 
  Given the clinical suspicion of infection, pneumonia is likely.  The heart
  size appears larger, most likely due to low lung volumes and incomplete
  inspiration.

 PORTABLE CHEST ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A confluent area of airspace opacity has developed in the left
 juxtahilar region and may reflect a developing pneumonia given clinical
 suspicion for infection.  More centrally in the left lower lobe, there has
 been improved aeration which may reflect improving atelectasis in this region.
 Worsening opacity in the right lower lobe predominantly in the retrocardiac
 region could reflect either atelectasis or an additional site of pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are accentuated by low lung volumes.  In the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, mild to moderate gastric distension has
 developed.
