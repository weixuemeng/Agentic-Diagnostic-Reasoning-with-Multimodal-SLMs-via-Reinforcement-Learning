                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, on peritoneal dialysis and
 hypertensive bleeds.  Presents with seizure.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  
 
 The lung volumes have markedly decreased since ___.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis given the low lung volumes.  The low lung volumes cause apparent
 cardiac enlargement and crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to extremely low lung volumes with probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.
