                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is likely mildly
 enlarged.  The aortic knob is slightly calcified, and the mediastinal contours
 are relatively unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Ill-defined opacities are noted in the lung bases, which may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with ill-defined opacities in the lung bases
 which may reflect atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
