 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices, except for the right internal jugular vein catheter, have been
 removed.  The cardiac silhouette continues to be moderately enlarged.  Today's
 image shows evidence of mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions that are
 minimally more extensive on the right than on the left.  The effusions cause
 areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  No pneumonia, no overt pulmonary
 edema.
