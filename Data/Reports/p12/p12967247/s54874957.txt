                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low oxygen saturation and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right
 basilar opacification likely reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter is noted with
 pigtail projecting over the region of the liver.  Several clips are noted in
 the right upper quadrant the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right basilar opacification with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm suggests
 atelectasis or an infectious process.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
