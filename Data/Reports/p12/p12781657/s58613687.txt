                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Compared with
 the previous examination a similar degree of perihilar opacity with slight
 decrease in interstitial thickening is consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema.  The density of the left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity is such that
 an infectious consolidation may be obscured in this area. Bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  The heart remains mild to moderately enlarged with
 calcified aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION: Minimally improved moderate pulmonary edema with more confluent
 retrocardiac opacity, potentially reflecting obscured pneumonia.  Consider
 conventional 2 view radiographs after diuresis to better assess this area.
