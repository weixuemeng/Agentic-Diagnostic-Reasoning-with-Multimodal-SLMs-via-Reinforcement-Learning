                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for right-sided opacity after hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 parenchymal opacity at the lung base almost completely cleared.  Substantially
 improved is the pre-existing retrocardiac parenchymal opacity.  No newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.  The tip of the right-sided PICC line is 1-2
 cm below the cavoatrial junction.  Mild fluid overload and moderate
 cardiomegaly, combined to tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persist.
