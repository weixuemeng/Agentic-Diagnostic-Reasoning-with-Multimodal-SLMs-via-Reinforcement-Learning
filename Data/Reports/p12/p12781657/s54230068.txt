                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC.  The cardiac silhouette
 is markedly enlarged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Prominence and indistinctness of the hila and bilateral perihilar opacities
 are most consistent with pulmonary edema.  Additional small patchy opacities
 in the mid lung zones bilaterally may relate to pulmonary edema although
 superimposed infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is severe compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body,
 stable, with focal kyphosis at this level.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette, small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 pulmonary edema suggest CHF.  Superimposed infectious process not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
