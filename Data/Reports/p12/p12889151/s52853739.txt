                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status and heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Triple-lead left-sided AICD is again seen, unchanged in position,
 with leads extending in the expected positions of the right atrium, right
 ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 stably enlarged.  Again, there is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vessels, raising the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette size is
 markedly out of proportion to the degree of vascular congestion, raising the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or possible pericardial effusion, although
 appearance is stable compared to prior.
