                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  ICD and right internal jugular central venous catheter are
 unchanged in position.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  New patchy opacity at right
 lung base with associated mild volume loss could reflect patchy atelectasis
 and/or dependent edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful
 to ensure resolution and to exclude developing infection in this region. 
 Small right pleural effusion is noted but there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
