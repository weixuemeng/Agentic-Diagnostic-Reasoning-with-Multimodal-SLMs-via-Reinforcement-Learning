                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increasing abdominal distention.  Study
 requested for evaluation of free air, abdominal distention and/or fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Severe cardiomegaly remains unchanged. Lung volumes remain low
 accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left-sided pacemaker remains
 in adequate position with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.   As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___,
 interstitial pulmonary edema has slightly increased. The stomach is distended.
 There is no definite evidence of free air in this limited examination. For a
 complete evaluation of free air, however, upright radiographs or CT should be
 performed. Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Slight increase of mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 
 2. Distended stomach. No definite evidence of free air in this limited
 examination. For a complete evaluation of free air, however, upright
 radiographs or CT should be performed.
