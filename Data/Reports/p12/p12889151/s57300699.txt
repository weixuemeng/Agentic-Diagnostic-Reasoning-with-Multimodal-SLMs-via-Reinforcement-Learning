                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus, respectively, appears
 unchanged.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Upper zone re-distribution of pulmonary vascularity and indistinct pulmonary
 vessels, as well as a mild interstitial process, suggest mild vascular
 congestion, similar to mildly increased.  Streaky superimposed right mid lung
 opacities are suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky focal opacities
 projecting over the right mid lung, although suspected to represent
 atelectasis.  If clinical findings are suggestive of infection in addition to
 congestive heart failure, then short-term radiographs may be helpful to
 re-assess.
