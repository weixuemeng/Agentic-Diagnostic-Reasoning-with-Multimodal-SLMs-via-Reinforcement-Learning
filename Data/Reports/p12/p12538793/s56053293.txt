                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with reported chills  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear. There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, probably unchanged compared to ___.  No pleural
 abnormalities. Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 are normal.  A right-sided PICC terminates at the expected location of the
 cavoatrial junction.  A pigtail catheter is noted to project over the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 There is a lucency projecting over the posterior right seventh rib which was
 present, but less conspicuous, on the chest radiograph obtained ___ and
 not present on the chest radiograph obtained ___.  The normal
 trabecular pattern of the rib in this region is not clearly delineated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right-sided PICC terminates at expected location of the cavoatrial
 junction.
 2. A lucency projecting over the posterior right seventh rib may reflect a
 healing rib fracture.  If no clinical history to support this possibility,
 recommend CT chest to rule out an underlying osseous lesion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:17 PM, approximately
