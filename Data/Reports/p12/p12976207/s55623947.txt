 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  There is increasing opacification at the right
 base, which could reflect developing pneumonia.  The left hemidiaphragm is

 associated pleural effusion.
 Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with little change in the degree of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
