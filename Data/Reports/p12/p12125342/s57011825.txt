                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with febrile neutropenia.  Rule out
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Chronic linear
 opacities overlying right hemithorax correlate with architectural distortion
 from prior lung resection seen on the ___ CT.  Increased lucency
 related to paraseptal emphysema (as shown on prior CT), potentially related to
 HIV, is unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 A misplaced right PICC present on ___ has been removed.  Chain
 sutures overlying the right apex are stable.  No new radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  Severe emphysema, possibly HIV-related. 
 Chronic right lung scarring and architectural distortion related to prior lung
 resection.
