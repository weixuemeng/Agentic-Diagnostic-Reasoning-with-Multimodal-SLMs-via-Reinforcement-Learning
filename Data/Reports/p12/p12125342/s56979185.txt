                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is coarseness of
 interstitial markings with mild increase in the retrosternal airspace,
 suggesting chronic pulmonary disease.  Tenting of the right hemidiaphragm is
 consistent with previous inflammatory disease in the right lower lung.  No
 acute focal pneumonia at this time.
