                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ?seizure activity, infection w/u  // Eval for
 PNA      Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular
 crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There are
 bibasilar opacities and blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles
 suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation. No significant pneumothorax is detected on this single
 semi-erect view. There is no free air beneath the diaphragm. S-shaped
 thoracolumbar scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis/consolidation.
