 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough for two days, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Minimal opacity
 in the inferior lingula could represent pneumonia.  The right lung is clear. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures are seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the region of the inferior lingula could
 represent a very early pneumonia.
