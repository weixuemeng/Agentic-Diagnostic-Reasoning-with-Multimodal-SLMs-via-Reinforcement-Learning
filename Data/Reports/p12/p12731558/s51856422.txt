  1. Heterogeneous opacity within right lower lobe may represent atelectasis
  however is worrisome for pneumonia/ aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate
  clinical setting.
  2. Low lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
  3. Tiny left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and crowding of vasculature.   Limited
 evaluation of heart size due to patient positioning and low lung volumes.
 Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Possible tiny left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities favoring atelectasis. PA
 and lateral chest radiographs with improved inspiratory level may be helpful
 for more complete assessment as a differential diagnosis includes aspiration
 and early pneumonia.
