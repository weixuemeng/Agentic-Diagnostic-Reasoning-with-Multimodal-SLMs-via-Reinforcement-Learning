 old woman with metastatic cancer, acute AMS      ___ year old woman with
 metastatic cancer, acute AMS
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Streaks of atelectasis are again seen at the bases.  At the right
 base medially, there is increased opacification which, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, could be worrisome for superimposed pneumonia.
