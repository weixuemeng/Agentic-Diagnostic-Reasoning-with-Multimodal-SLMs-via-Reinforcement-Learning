                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent pleuritic pain on
 right side of chest and right mid back, CT of abdomen/pelvis noted small right
 pleural effusion, the presence of bilateral small atelectasis, reevaluate for
 pathology.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.
 
 The heart size remains within normal limits.  No configurational abnormalities
 are identified.  There is now a hazy density over the right lower lung field
 and a mild degree of blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus is noted. 
 The lateral view reveals a pleural density that fills in the right posterior
 pleural sinus and extends along the right posterior chest wall.  There is no
 evidence of coinciding new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and no evidence
 of pneumothorax in the apical area can be identified.  Skeletal structures of
 the thorax grossly within normal limits.
 
 In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, the
 presently described rather loculated pleural density is new and is located to
 the lower posterior aspect of the right pleura.  No evidence of coinciding
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  The left hemithorax remains normal. 
 Comparison with the most recent abdominal/pelvic CT of ___
 demonstrates that a small amount of right-sided pleural effusion existed
 already at that time.  The present chest examination indicates that the amount
 of pleural effusion has increased.  Further followup recommended.
