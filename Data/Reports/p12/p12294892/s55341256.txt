                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CMP s/p biventricular pacemaker via left
 axillary vein.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of biventricular pacemaker with leads in
 expected location.  However, the relationship with the ventricular walls
 cannot be appreciated in one view.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and interstitial opacities.  However, the heart
 is mildly enlarged.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is
 no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.Right-sided Port-A-Cath likely terminates in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax. Status post biventricular pacemaker with the leads in
 expected location.
