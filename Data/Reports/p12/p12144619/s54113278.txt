                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of amyloidosis. Low grade fevers and
 crackles  // assess for consolidation/PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes and the right hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 unchanged.  Again seen is streaky opacity at the left lung base, which is
 slightly more pronounced than on the radiograph from ___.  No frank
 consolidation is identified.  There is no CHF or new effusion.  Rounded
 density in the right mid zone posteriorly, consistent with known loculated
 fluid, may be slightly smaller.  Associated linear atelectasis or thickening
 of the minor fissure is seen on today's exam.  There is minimal blunting of
 the costophrenic angles posteriorly.  Right sided central line tip overlies
 the distal SVC.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Streaky linear curvilinear opacities at left lung base are very slightly
 more pronounced on today's exam, though no frank consolidation is seen.  The
 possibility of an early infectious infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
 2. Known rounded opacity in the right mid lung may be slightly smaller.
