 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema, and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  The effusions have decreased in size
 compared to the previous exam, and the extent of basilar atelectasis is also
 reduced.  Note is also made of questionable pneumopericardium as well as a
 subtle lucency adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm.  Although these findings
 may be projectional in nature, further evaluation with a left lateral
 decubitus abdominal radiograph may be helpful to exclude the possibility of
 free intraperitoneal air and to re-assess the questionable pneumopericardium.
