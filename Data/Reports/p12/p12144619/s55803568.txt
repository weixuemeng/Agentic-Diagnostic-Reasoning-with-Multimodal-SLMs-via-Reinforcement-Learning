                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with amyloidosis status post stem cell transplant
 with dyspnea and tachypnea.  Evaluation for new edema or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval increase in
 pulmonary vascular congestion and thickening along the minor fissure
 consistent with mild interval worsening of pulmonary edema.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis/collapse aconts for right lower lung opacitiy.  Left lung base
 opacification remains,and is could represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is also likely a small left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  Heart size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Right lower lobe atelectasis/collapse.
 2. Slightly worsened pulmonary edema.
 3. Left lung base opacity could be due to atelectasis, pneumonia is possible
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
