 There has been removal of the right-sided central line.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  There are infiltrates in the lung bases, including a
 left retrocardiac opacity.  Right basilar opacity is more confluent.  Although
 this may represent atelectasis, underlying pneumonia or aspiration is
 suspected.  There are no signs for pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
