  Similar-appearing rounded opacity at the left lung base, which is again likely
  a nipple shadow.  Given the similar appearance on the lateral view, if
  confirmation is absolutely necessary, the patient could return for repeat
  imaging with a nipple marker.  Unfortunately, the patient had left the
  department at the time of study interpretation.  Otherwise, the lungs are
  clear.
