                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent right-sided pneumonia, history of amyloidosis.  Now with
 cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, CT chest
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been little overall change. 
 Redemonstrated is a confluent opacification of the right middle and right
 lower lobes, most likely representing an area of atelectasis. As compared to
 the prior examination, there has been interval improvement in the
 opacification of the left lower lobe.  Bilateral, small pleural effusions are
 noted.  The upper lung fields are grossly unremarkable.  No pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema is identified.  There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacification of the right lower and middle lobes, probably repersenting
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Bilateral, small pleural effusions.
