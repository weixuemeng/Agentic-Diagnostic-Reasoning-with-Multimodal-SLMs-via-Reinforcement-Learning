                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with +blood cultures, h/o lung abscess  // evidence
 of pneumonia, abscess
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Redemonstrated is a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter with the
 tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. Lung volumes
 remain low. Redemonstrated is a large loculated pleural effusion noted within
 the right major fissure.  Streaky left retrocardiac opacities likely represent
 atelectasis, although infection is difficult to exclude. There is no
 appreciable pneumothorax identified. The right hemidiaphragm is mildly
 elevated relative to the left. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Low lung volumes an increase left lower lobe retrocardiac streaky airspace
 opacities. Findings likely represent atelectasis, although underlying
 infection is difficult to exclude completely.
 2. Stable appearance of a loculated right pleural effusion within the major
 fissure.
