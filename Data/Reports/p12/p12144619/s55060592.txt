                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with amyloydosis
 
 COMPARISON:  There is no prior chest x-ray for comparison at the time of
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung is well inflated.  The right lung is clear.  At the base of
 the left lung is projected a rounded 6-mm opacity, which is likely the left
 nipple.  In the lateral view, a second 8-mm rounded opacity is projected
 anteriorly, at the cardiac base.  Also, this opacity might be a nipple,
 considering that the lateral view is severely rotated and not in proper
 position.  The patient will be contacted by technician to repeat the lateral
 view, , the primary care physician should request ___ chest fluoroscopy if
 needed to assess fully the aforementioned opacity.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal chest x-ray, except for a small rounded opacity projected
 in the lateral view in the cardiac region.  This opacity is likely a nipple,
 but considering the rotated acquisition of the lateral view, a second
 acquisition in proper position is needed.
