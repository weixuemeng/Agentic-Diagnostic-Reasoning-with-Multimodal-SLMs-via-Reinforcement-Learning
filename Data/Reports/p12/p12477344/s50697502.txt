                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Chain sutures are noted within the
 left mid lung field as result of prior lingulectomy.  Lungs are hyperinflated.
 Subtle areas of opacification are seen in the right upper lobe, right lung
 base, and left upper lobe corresponding to ground-glass lesions seen on the
 previous chest CT, and thought to reflect areas of hemorrhage associated with
 pulmonary metastases.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 compatible with a small pleural effusion, perhaps decreased in size from the
 prior study.  No new focal consolidation is present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Scarring within the lung apices is re- demonstrated.  Known
 pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not well assessed on the current
 radiograph.  Diffuse osseous metastatic lesions are also better assessed on
 the previous CT.  Moderate loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Subtle areas of opacification in the right upper lobe, right lung base, and
 left upper lobe corresponding to ground-glass opacities seen on prior chest
 CT, thought to reflect hemorrhage associated with pulmonary metastases.  No
 new areas of opacification are demonstrated.
 2. Small right pleural effusion, perhaps minimally decreased in size from the
 previous CT.
 3. Known pulmonary nodules and osseous metastases are better assessed on the
 prior CT.
