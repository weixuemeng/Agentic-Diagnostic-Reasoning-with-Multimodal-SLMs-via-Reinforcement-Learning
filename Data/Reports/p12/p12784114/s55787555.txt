                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 17:01 obtained at ___
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP views of the chest were obtained with a total of three
 exposures.  Each exposure performed after further manipulation of the enteric
 tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position with the tip 3.2
 cm from the carina.  Multiple attempts at passing a nasogastric tube beyond
 the diaphragm were unsuccessful with each image showing the nasogastric tube
 in the distal esophagus.  
 
 The lungs volumes are low which accentuates the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is a new right mid lung zone opacity, likely aspiration.  Additionaly,
 there is new mild pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is within normal limits allowing for
 technique.  The heart size is difficult to assess given the low lung volumes. 
 Contrast material is seen within the upper abdomen from the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube.
 2.  Nasogastric tube with the tip in the distal esophagus.
 3.  New right mid lung zone opacity, likely aspiration.
 4.  New mild pulmonary edema.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:30 AM on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___.
