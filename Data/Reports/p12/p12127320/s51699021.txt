                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, agitation, weakness.  Check Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right lower chest and lateral right hemidiaphragm excluded from the film. 
 
 Dobbhoff tube is present.  However, it is looped over the level of the fundus,
 with the radiopaque tip now superimposed over the lower neck and 
 it requires repositioning.
 
 Right-sided PICC line present, tip not optimally visualized but likely
 overlying the distal SVC near the RA junction. 
 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker present with lead tips over right atrium and
 right ventricle. Status post sternotomy with mediastinal clips.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent,but unchanged.    Allowing for low
 lung volumes, I doubt overt CHF.  Increased retrocardiac density and
 atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region are unchanged compared with
 ___ at 4:27 a.m.  Cervical fusion hardware again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Abnormal placement of Dobbhoff tube -- the tube reaches the gastric fundus,
 where there is a "hairpin" bend of the tube, then courses back up the
 esophagus, so that the radiopaque tube tip overlies the neck. 
 
 Findings discussed with  Dr. ___ at approximately 1:45 p.m. on
 the day of the exam (___, phone).
