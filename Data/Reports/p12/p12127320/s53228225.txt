                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aseptic meningitis.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING:  
 
 The extreme left costophrenic angle and left lung base are excluded from the
 film.  
 
 A PICC line is present -- the tip is not optimally visualized due to
 underpenetration.  A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips
 over right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. The patient is status post sternotomy, with
 mediastinal clips.   There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region.  Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature is noted, but
 likely accentuated due to technique and low lung volumes.  Possible small left
 pleural effusion.  Incidental note is made of fusion hardware in the lower
 cervical spine.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:07 a.m., I doubt significant interval change.
