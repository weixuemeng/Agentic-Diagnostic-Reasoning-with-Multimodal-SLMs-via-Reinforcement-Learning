                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess PICC line.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The PICC ends at the junction of the upper and middle SVC, and has
 been pulled back since the prior radiograph.  A pacemaker is in place with the
 leads seen in the left ventricle and right atrium.  Sternal wires are intact
 and midline.  Multiple clips are seen within the mediastinum.  Since the prior
 radiograph, there has been resolution of the right pleural effusion.
 Opacification of the left base likely represents a persistent left effusion. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  PICC ends at upper to mid SVC.
 2.  Persistent left pleural effusion.  Resolution of right pleural effusion.
