                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, needing chest x-ray to assess trajectory of pulmonary
 disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Pulmonary vascularity is mildly engorged but less
 prominent than on the previous study.  Opacification at the bases with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral layering
 effusions, more prominent on the left, with underlying compressive
 atelectasis.  Central catheter tip again extends to the upper to mid portion
 of the SVC.
