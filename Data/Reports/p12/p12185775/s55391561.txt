 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple episodes of respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  The right internal jugular vein introduction sheath has been
 removed.  The pre-existing right pleural effusion has completely resolved.  On
 the left, however, the pre-existing pleural effusion persists and has
 minimally increased in extent.  There are subsequent areas of retrocardiac and
 basal atelectasis.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Two calcified
 lung nodules in the left apex.
