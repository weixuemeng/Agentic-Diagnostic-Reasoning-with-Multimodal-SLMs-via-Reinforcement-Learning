 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:01 PM
  Worsening pulmonary edema with increased opacification at the right lung base
  and right retrocardiac region likely worsening pleural effusion with collapsed
  right lower lobe/atelectastes vs worsening edema. Underlying infection can't
  be excluded. Trachea mildly deviated to right which may be positional or
  related to right lower lobe collapse. Milder opacification at left lung base
  may represent worsening edema vs effusion vs atelectasis. d/w dr. ___ at
  10:57pm on ___ via tel.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:23 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening hypoxia and tachypnea.  Rales.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened again.  The relatively greater
 opacification at the right lung base seen previously was due to a combination
 of edema, atelectasis and right pleural effusion, so it is not necessary to
 invoke possible pneumonia to explain the current radiographic findings.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement
 and distention of mediastinal veins have worsened.  No pneumothorax.  Large
 calcified granulomas longstanding in the upper lungs.
