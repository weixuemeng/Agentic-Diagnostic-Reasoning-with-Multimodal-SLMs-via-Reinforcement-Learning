 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 7:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with respiratory failure, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 7:59.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 7:37 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the right
 pulmonary artery, unchanged.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic
 inlet in satisfactory position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm.  There is blunting of left costophrenic angle with some
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting a small effusion with patchy
 compressive atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Improving
 with residual minimal interstitial edema.  Left upper and mid calcified
 nodules likely reflect granulomata.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
