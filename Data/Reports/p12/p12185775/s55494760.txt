                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 mildly calcified and tortuous.  The central pulmonary vessels are engorged and
 hazy, accompanied by patchy interstitial opacities, most dense at the left
 base.  An ET tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 terminates within the stomach.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities.  In the setting of central
 vascular congestion, this is most likely severe pulmonary edema, but pneumonia
 cannot be excluded, particularly at the left base.
 2.  ET tube terminating 4.7 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube within the
 stomach.
