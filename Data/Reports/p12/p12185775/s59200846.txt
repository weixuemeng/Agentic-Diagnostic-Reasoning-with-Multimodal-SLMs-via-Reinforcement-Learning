                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 has slightly improved and is more substantially improved compared to ___.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly decreased in extent, and
 a small left pleural effusion is also slightly smaller compared to the prior
 study.  Small right pleural effusion is not changed, and a minor area of
 opacity at the right base appears similar to the recent study but improvement
 compared to earlier radiographs.  Calcified granulomas in left upper lobe are
 unchanged.  No new areas of consolidation are evident to suggest an acute
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new areas of consolidation to suggest a source of infection.
