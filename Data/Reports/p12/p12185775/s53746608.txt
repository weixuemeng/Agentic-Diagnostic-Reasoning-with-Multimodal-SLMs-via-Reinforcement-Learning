                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess ET tube after reposition.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier.
 
 ET tube has been repositioned, now the tip is in standard position, 4.6 cm
 above the carina.  Diffuse lung opacities have worsened in the left lower
 lobe, this new focal opacity in the left lower lobe could be due to
 atelectasis and or aspiration.
