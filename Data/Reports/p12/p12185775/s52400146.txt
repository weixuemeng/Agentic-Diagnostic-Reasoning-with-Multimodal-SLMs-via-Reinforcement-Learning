 AP CHEST, 9:07 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease and MI.  CHF with flash pulmonary edema. 
 Now with question chest pain, question aortic dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Previous pulmonary edema has not recurred.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable, and there is no change in the configuration of the thoracic aorta to
 suggest dissection, although that diagnosis is not excluded by the stable
 appearance on conventional chest radiographs.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is present.
