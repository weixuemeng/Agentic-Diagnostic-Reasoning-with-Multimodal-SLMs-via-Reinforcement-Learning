                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  eval for pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and MVR, as before.  The heart
 and mediastinal structures are unchanged, allowing for differences in
 technique.  Interstitial markings remain prominent.  There is increased
 streaky density at the lung bases and the retrocardiac area appears opaque. 
 There is now a very small right pneumothorax.  A Swan-___ catheter chest
 tubes mediastinal drains endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been
 removed.  The right internal jugular introducer remains in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Development of very small right pneumothorax post chest tube removal. 
 Persistent prominent interstitial markings likely reflecting vascular
 congestion.  Subsegmental atelectasis.  Increased density in the retrocardiac
 area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation as seen previously.
