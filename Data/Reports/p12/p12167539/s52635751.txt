                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p single chamber PM implantation  // check
 for pnx and lead location
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, vascular markings are slightly increased. 
 Inspiratory volumes are lower.  Again seen is platelike atelectasis at both
 lung bases, slightly more pronounced.  Interval increase in the degree of
 retrocardiac opacity could reflect low lung volumes/atelectasis.
 
 Again noted is cardiomegaly, with prior sternotomy and TAVR.
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is a new single lead right-sided
 pacemaker with lead tip over the right ventricle.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of single lead pacemaker.  The lead tip overlies the right
 ventricle.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are somewhat lower compared with ___ with
 slight increase in the degree of bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Possible mild vascular plethora.
