                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post wedge resection and SVC reconstruction.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back through ___, including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pleural catheter ends along the mid lateral right chest
 wall, not significantly changed.  An enteric catheter courses below the level
 of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly, as before.  There
 are midline sternotomy wires and right hemi-thoracic surgical clips.  Skin
 ___ overlie the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax.  Widespread
 heterogeneous opacities throughout the left lung are substantially increased
 compared to the prior radiograph from ___, new compared to the
 radiographs from ___, either asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 widespread infection.  Right mid-to-lower lung subsegmental atelectasis is
 increased.  A substantial persistent right pleural space is decreased compared
 to the most recent study from ___.  An unchanged wedge-shaped
 right upper lobe opacity could be secondary to right middle lobe collapse. 
 The heart size is normal.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Subcutaneous
 air along the right lateral chest wall is decreased.  Multiple right-sided rib
 defects/deformities and resection of the medial aspect of the right clavicle
 are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased widespread left lung heterogeneous opacities, likely asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, although widespread infection could have an identical
 appearance.
 
 2.  Unchanged right upper lung wedge-shaped opacity, possibly related to right
 middle lobe collapse, either with or without torsion.
 
 2.  Decreased persisent right pleural space and extent of right lateral chest
 wall subcutaneous air.
 
 3.  Increased mild-to-moderate right mid-to-lower lung atelectasis.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:49 a.m.
 via telephone on the day of the study.  Updated findings were then discussed
 with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 12:59 p.m. via telephone on the day of the
 study.
