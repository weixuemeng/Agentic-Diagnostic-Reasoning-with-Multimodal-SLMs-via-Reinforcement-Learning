                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Poor respiratory status, intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Small right pneumothorax has increased.  Atelectasis/collapse of the lung that
 occupies the apex is persistent.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  ET tube is in
 the standard position.  Right chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Sternal
 wires are aligned.  Multiple surgical clips project in the right hemithorax. 
 Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has improved.  If any, there is a
 small right pleural effusion.  Ill-defined opacities in the lower lobes
 bilaterally are likely minimal interstitial edema.
