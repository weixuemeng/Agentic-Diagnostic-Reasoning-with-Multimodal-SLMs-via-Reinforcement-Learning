                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.  A large
 homogeneous area of opacity persists in the upper right hemithorax and may
 represent a loculated fluid collection.  Additional component of pleural
 effusion at the right base has slightly increased.  The right middle and right
 lower lobe remains partially opacified, but there has overall been slight
 improved aeration within the right mid lung region as compared to the prior
 radiograph.  Within the left lung, there is improvement in a combined alveolar
 and interstitial pattern which probably reflects pulmonary edema.
