                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of a right upper lobectomy and
 VATS decortication for squamous cell carcinoma who presents for evaluation of
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest obtained portably with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___; ___;
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacification of the apex of the right chest is unchanged and may
 be likely secondary to a combination of pleural fluid and hematoma.  The
 layering right pleural effusion is also unchanged. There appears to be slight
 interval worsening of the right middle lobe consolidation. A right-sided chest
 tube courses medially to the apex, unchanged in position compared to the prior
 exam.  The left lung interstitial edema and small left pleural effusion are
 unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The ET tube terminates 2.4 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric catheter courses below the diaphragm with the tip below
 the field of view of the exam.  Sternal wires are intact over the lower half
 of the sternum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Stable layering right pleural effusion and apical hematoma/pleural fluid
 loculation.  
 
 2. Slight interval worsening of the right mid lung consolidation. This could
 be consistent with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion, however pneumonia
 cannot be ruled out in the appropriate clinical setting.
