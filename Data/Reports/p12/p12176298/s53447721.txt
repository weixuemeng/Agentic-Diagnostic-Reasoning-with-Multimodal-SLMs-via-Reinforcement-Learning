                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right lower lobe
 collapse after bronchoscopy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The tracheostomy tube is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly unchanged as well as there is no substantial change in
 loculated pleural effusion and right lung consolidation.  There is slight
 interval progression of diffuse left lung opacities that might reflect
 progression of infectious process, or a combination of infection and pulmonary
 edema.  Left pleural effusion is unchanged.
