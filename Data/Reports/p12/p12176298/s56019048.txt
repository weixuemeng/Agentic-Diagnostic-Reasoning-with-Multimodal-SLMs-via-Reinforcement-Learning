                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for mucous plugging and shortness of breath in a
 patient status post righ upper lobe wedge resection and superior vena cava
 reconstruction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___,
 15 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  A right pleural catheter courses along the lateral right chest
 and is unchanged in position.  Upper enteric tube passes into stomach and off
 of the radiograph.  Midline sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.  Right
 hilar clips and additional clips in the right hemithorax are unchanged. 
 Diffuse opacities throughout the left lung have continued to increase since
 ___ and are highly concerning for infection.  Right lower lung
 atelectasis and a right apical pneumothorax are unchanged. A triangular
 opacity in the right upper lung adjacent to he superior mediastinum is
 unchanged and could represent fluid related to the surgery.  The heart size is
 normal and aortic calcifications are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion.
 Subcutaneous air along the right lateral chest wall has decreased. 
 Right-sided rib defects and deformiting as well as resection of the medial
 aspect of the right clavicle are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Continued increase in heterogeneous opacities in the left lung is
 concerning for infection.
 
 2.  Unchanged right upper lung wedge-shaped opacity that could represet a
 fluid collection. 
 
 3.  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
