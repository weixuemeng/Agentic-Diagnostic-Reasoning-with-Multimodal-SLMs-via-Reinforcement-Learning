                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.  Lung volumes are
 lower compared to the recent study, with resultant accentuation of
 cardiomediastinal contours and bronchovascular structures.  With this
 limitation in mind, there has been no relevant short-interval change in the
 appearance of the chest since the recent study.
