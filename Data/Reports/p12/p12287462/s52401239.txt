                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ETT is seen with distal tip approximately 3.4 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube is noted with tip in the distal stomach. There remains gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic
 calcifications within the arch. Prominence of the right hilum is noted, and
 there is linear opacity abutting the minor fissure on the right compatible
 with right upper lobe atelectasis. Patchy opacities in the right upper lobe
 could reflect mild asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection is not
 excluded. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified on this supine exam. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions. Gaseous distention of
 the stomach persists.
 2. Right upper lobe atelectasis.
 3. Patchy opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema but infection is not excluded.
