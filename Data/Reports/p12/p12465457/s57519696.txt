                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiply relapsed lymphoma, on
 chemotherapy, with fever to 103, markedly decreased breath sounds on L, newly
 on O2  // any sign of infection or fluid overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, there has been little change in
 the appearance of the chest except for a new opacity in the periphery of the
 left lung base adjacent to a small left pleural effusion.  This new finding is
 difficult to characterize on a single portable projection, and could be due to
 atelectasis, and less likely an early focus of infection or localized
 infarction.
