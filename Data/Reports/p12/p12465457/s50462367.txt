                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bone marrow transplant, recurrent fevers, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is rotated and
 the exam is technically limited.  However, there is a zone of increased
 radiodensity at the right lung base, that is likely caused by patient rotation
 and overlying soft tissues.  However, to exclude early pneumonia, a short-term
 radiographic followup should be obtained, ideally in standing position. 
 Unchanged right-sided intravascular devices.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Atelectasis at the left
 lung bases.  No larger pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
