                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath after exposure, evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart is normal
 size, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment for edema.   There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Low volume lungs limit assessment for mild edema. Repeat radiographs with full
 inspiration would be helpful if indicated.
