                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ESRD on dialysis now SOB  // evaluate for fluid
 overload        review of prior imaging reports yields a history of HIV,
 asthma and right breast cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.
 
 Compared with ___, there is more pronounced upper zone redistribution
 and vascular blurring.  The bibasilar opacities are also somewhat more
 extensive.  There is a probable small right effusion.  A small left effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There are air bronchograms at the left lung base.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by surrounding opacities, but is
 overall similar to prior.
 
 The SVC and axillary stents are again noted, unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, slightly more pronounced compared
 with ___.  The possibility of an associated infectious infiltrate
 cannot be excluded.  Small right and possible smaller left pleural effusion.
 
 Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.  In a conventional
 setting, this appearance, all taken together, would be compatible with CHF and
 interstitial and alveolar edema.
 
 Given the history of HIV, if the patient has an appropriately low CD4 count,
 the differential for the interstitial opacities could include PCP.
