                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated.  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again
 demonstrate stents projecting over the right subclavian and brachiocephalic
 veins.  Lung volumes are low, resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, the cardiac
 silhouette appears enlarged. Patchy opacities projecting over the bilateral
 lower lung, left more than right with corresponding patchy opacities on
 lateral view, are concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Additionally, there is
 mild pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 visualized upper abdomen demonstrates metallic coils projecting over the left
 upper abdomen, as before.  Right acromioclavicular arthropathy and
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The patient is markedly rotated with projection of the cardiac silhouette
 over the right lung.  Patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lung, left more
 than right concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 A followup chest radiograph is recommended following treatment to assess
 resolution.
