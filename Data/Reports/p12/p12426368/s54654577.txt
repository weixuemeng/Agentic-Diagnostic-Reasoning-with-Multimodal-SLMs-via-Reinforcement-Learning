                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Headache and left shoulder pain after fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stents along the right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins are
 noted.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Streaky left basilar opacity is unchanged and consistent
 with minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Soft tissue calcifications are noted
 lateral to the chest on the right, not fully imaged, but probably unchanged
 and likely relating to the presence of an arteriovenous fistula. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
