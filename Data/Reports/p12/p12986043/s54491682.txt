                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with acute respiratory distress, tachypnea, interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear except for minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  A
 left-sided PICC line still ends at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and
 superior vena cava.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 stomach is moderately distended.  The aorta is tortuous and dilated as shown
 on recent CT.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no acute cardiopulmonary process that could explain the respiratory
 distress.
