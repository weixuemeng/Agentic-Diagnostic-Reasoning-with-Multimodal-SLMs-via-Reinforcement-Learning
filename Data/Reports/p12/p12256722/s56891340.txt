 OG tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 an orogastric tube that extends to the mid portion of the stomach.  The
 side-port appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Little
 change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
