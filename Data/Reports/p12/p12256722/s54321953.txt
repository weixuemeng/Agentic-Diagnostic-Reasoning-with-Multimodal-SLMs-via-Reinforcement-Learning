                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses into the stomach with tip off the inferior borders of the
 film.  An additional catheter is noted projecting over the midline and
 terminating at the region of the T1 vertebral body.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum may also be accounted for by low lung volumes and supine
 technique.  There is mild pulmonary edema with upper zone vascular
 redistribution and vascular indistinctness.  More focal opacities in the lung
 bases and right upper lobe may reflect areas of atelectasis but aspiration or
 infection is not excluded.  No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion on this
 supine exam.  No displaced fractures are visualized.  Fixation plates and
 screws are seen within the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Catheter tip noted projecting over the midline T1 vertebral body, perhaps a
 temperature probe, and clinical correlation is recommended.
 3. Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Additional focal opacities in the
 lung bases and right upper lobe may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.
