                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Mild cough and fever.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Ill-defined opacity projecting
 posteriorly in one of the lower lobes seen in the lateral ribs could represent
 a focus of infection.  Given the clinical symptoms, I cannot exclude that this
 is also partially due to superimposition of structures and followup is
 recommended.  Otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
