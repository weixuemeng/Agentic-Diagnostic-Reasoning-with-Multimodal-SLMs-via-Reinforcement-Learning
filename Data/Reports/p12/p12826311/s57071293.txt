                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after Dobbhoff tube
 placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the proximal stomach.  The right central venous
 line tip is at the level of low SVC.  There is questionable new right mid
 upper lung opacity, although it might reflect summation of shadows, attention
 to this area on the subsequent studies is recommended to exclude the
 possibility of developing infection.  Rest is unchanged.
