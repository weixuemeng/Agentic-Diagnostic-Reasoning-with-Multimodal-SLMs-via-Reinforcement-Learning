                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:31 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax after heart surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 6:08 p.m.
 
 There is no detectable pneumothorax.  The volume of air in the pericardium
 and/or mediastinum is larger than generally seen postoperatively.  Mild
 cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous distention
 persists.  There is probably no pulmonary edema.  Right basal atelectasis is
 moderately severe, slightly more pronounced.  Swan-Ganz catheter is looped in
 the main pulmonary artery.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach and
 would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.  No appreciable pleural effusion.
