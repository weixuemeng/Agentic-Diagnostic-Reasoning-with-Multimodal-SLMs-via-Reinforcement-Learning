                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation for AMS  // Eval ETI placement after
 withdrawal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 23:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed approximately 30 minutes earlier, the
 endotracheal tube has been retracted and now terminates approximately 3.2 cm
 above the carina.  However, the neck is flexed during this study, and the tip
 of the tube will likely be too low when the head position changes. There is
 otherwise no significant interval change.  Right internal jugular catheter and
 enteric tube are unchanged.
 
 Lung volumes remain low, particularly on the left where there is a
 moderately-sized pleural effusion.  The right lung is essentially clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina with the
 neck in flexion.  Please note that the tube will likely be too low with
 changes in neck positioning.
 2. Otherwise no change from 30 minutes prior.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 10:52 AM, 60 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
