 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left lung base is
 likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates within the right mainstem bronchus, and should be
 withdrawn by approximately 6-7 cm.  The enteric tube terminates in at least
 the stomach, although the tip extends beyond the inferior margin of this
 image.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right atrium.
