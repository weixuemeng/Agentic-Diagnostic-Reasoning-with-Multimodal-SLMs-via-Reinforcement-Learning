 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 21:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with paranoid delusion, rule out acute
 process.
 
 No comparison studies at this institution.  Please note that comparison to old
 films can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views ___ at 21:52 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The heart is enlarged, which most likely reflects cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  The aorta is somewhat
 unfolded and tortuous.  Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal
 airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. 
 Interstitium is slightly prominent, but this likely reflects age-related
 changes or small airways disease.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
