                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.  Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are seen with cephalization and interstitial markings
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent pleural
 effusions and associated atelectasis but infection cannot be fully excluded. 
 Right middle lobe opacity could represent asymmetric edema or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Degenerative changes and compression deformity
 is seen at the thoracolumbar junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions though a focal consolidation
 cannot be fully excluded, as above.  Consider repeat imaging following
 diuresis.
