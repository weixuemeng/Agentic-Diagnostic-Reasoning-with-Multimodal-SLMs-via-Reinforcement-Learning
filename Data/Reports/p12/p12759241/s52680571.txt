                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old male with CHF, question edema or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, but not in
 overall severity.  Greater opacification at the base of the right lung could
 be explained by pleural effusion, and in the axillary region of the right lung
 by asymmetric edema, but there is no way to exclude concurrent pneumonia. 
 Heart size is only mildly enlarged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 presumed.  No pneumothorax.
