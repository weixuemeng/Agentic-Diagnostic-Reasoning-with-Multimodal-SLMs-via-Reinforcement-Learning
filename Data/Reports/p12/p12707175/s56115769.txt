                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity is seen which likely represents volume loss left lower
 lobe however pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A lateral view would be helpful in
 localizing the opacity. Also seen is a small opacity at the base of the right
 lung which partially obscures the right hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pleural surfaces are normal
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely represents volume loss left lower lobe however
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
