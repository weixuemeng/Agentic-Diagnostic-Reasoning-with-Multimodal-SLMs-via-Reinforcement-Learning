                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CNS lymphoma, admitted for chemotherapy, new dyspnea, question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:18 a.m.
 
 Slight differences in the configuration of the central line port may reflect
 differences in positioning.  The line tip is again seen overlying the mid SVC.
 The lungs are hyperinflated ,suggesting background COPD.  Again seen is mild
 patchy atelectasis and/or scarring at both bases.  There is also prominence of
 upper zone vessels, suggestive of scarring and some pleural thickening at both
 lung apices.  There is possible mild pulmonary engorgement, unchanged.  No
 overt CHF.  No effusion.  No frank consolidation. Mild cardiomegaly, with
 calcified aorta is unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable background COPD, with basilar and apical scarring bilaterally,
 similar to prior. 
 
 2.  Possible mild vascular engorgement, consistent with mild fluid overload,
 similar to the prior film.  No overt CHF.
