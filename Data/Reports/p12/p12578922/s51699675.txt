                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Port placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 Port-A-Cath with its tip in the region of the mid portion of the SVC at the
 level of the carina.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly more prominent. 
 There is some engorgement of the pulmonary vessels, suggesting some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure as well as opacification of the costophrenic angle
 posteriorly representing a pleural effusion on uncertain side.  No evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia.
