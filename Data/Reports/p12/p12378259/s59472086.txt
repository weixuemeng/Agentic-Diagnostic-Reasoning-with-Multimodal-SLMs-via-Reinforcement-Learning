  Unchanged appearance of bilateral, multifocal patchy airspace opacities
  suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. Given these airspace opacities, the degree
  of underlying pulmonary edema is difficult to evaluate. No large pleural

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, CHF, a-fib, history of multiple myeloma
 in remission presenting with pneumonia.  // please assess for infiltrates and
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are extensive diffuse patchy multifocal airspace opacities throughout
 both lungs. Although they appear more pronounced compare with the prior film,
 this is likely accentuated due to technical differences. Given th the presence
 of diffuse opacities, it is difficult to exclude superimposed CHF, but the
 left lung base laterally is relatively clear and no pleural effusion is seen
 on either side, making superimposed CHF less likely.
 
 Again seen are calcified mediastinal and left hilar nodes and a calcified
 granuloma in the left upper zone, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged allowing for
 technique. Left-sided pacemaker with leads over right atrium and right
 ventricle unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multifocal bibasilar opacities seen throughout both lungs, consistent with
 airspace disease. In the appropriate clinical setting, this would be
 compatible with pneumonia or ARDS. Doubt superimpose CHF. Please see comment
 above.
 2. Calcified nodes and granuloma consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
