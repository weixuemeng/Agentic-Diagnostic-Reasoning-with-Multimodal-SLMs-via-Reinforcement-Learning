                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with afib, cardiomyopathy, who had ARDS and
 respiratory failure due to amiodarone. Now off amiodarone for 2 months.  //
 any improvement in the infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained ___, there is a
 decrease in the severity and extent of micronodular and interstitial
 opacities.  No new lung opacities.  Calcified granuloma in the left upper lung
 is unchanged since at least ___.  Heart size is top normal without
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  Median sternotomy wires
 are midline and intact.  A dual chamber pacemaker is unchanged in the position
 with appropriately placed leads.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved bilateral parenchymal opacities.  It is unclear whether these
 opacities reflect chronic changes of pulmonary edema or amiodarone toxicity.
