                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever, and elevated white count.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, heterogenous opacification in the left lower
 lobe is new partially obscuring hemidiaphragm posteriorly.  No other
 consolidation is identified.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the aortic
 arch.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and very slightly bigger
 than on the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Recommend oblique views of the chest to better assess possible left lower
 lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Mild vascular congestion and slight increase in mild cardiomegaly without
 overt pulmonary edema.
