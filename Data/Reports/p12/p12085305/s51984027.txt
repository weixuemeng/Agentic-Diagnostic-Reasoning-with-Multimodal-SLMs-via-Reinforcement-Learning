                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breathe, cough  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy with mild cardiomegaly.  Midline sternal
 wires are well aligned and intact.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present, improved since the prior
 examination.  There are small posterior effusions, likely bilateral.
 
 Exaggerated kyphosis of the upper thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacity of both lung bases is more
 suggestive of atelectasis, but the differential diagnosis could include early
 pneumonic infiltrates.  No frank consolidation identified.
