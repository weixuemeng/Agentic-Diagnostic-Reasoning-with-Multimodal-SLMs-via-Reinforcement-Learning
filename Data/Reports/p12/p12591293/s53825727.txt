                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Recent right knee arthroplasty with leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and vasculature. 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged. There is re- demonstration of mild vascular
 congestion and interstitial edema.  Subtle right base and retrocardiac
 opacities may represent atelectasis.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Sclerotic bone changes consistent with history of
 sickle cell.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild fluid overload and edema. Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Post-diuresis
 re-examination may be helpful.
