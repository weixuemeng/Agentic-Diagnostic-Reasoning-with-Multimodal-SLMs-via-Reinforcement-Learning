                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent TKR washout and spacer, anemia, question
 of pneumonia on rehab chest radiograph
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Assessment of the medial lung apices is slightly
 limited by the patient's chin and neck projecting over and obscuring these
 regions.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged, accentuated by low lung volumes.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Minimal patchy
 atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Hypertrophic changes are noted within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite radiographic
 evidence for pneumonia.
