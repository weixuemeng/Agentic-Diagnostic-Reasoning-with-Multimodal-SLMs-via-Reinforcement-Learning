                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // Eval for acute process, PNA      . 
 Review of prior studies indicates a history of sickle cell disorder.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Medial uppermost portion both lung apices
 is obscured by the patient's chin.
 
 Mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette is again noted, similar to
 prior, but could be accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 Perihilar interstitial markings are slightly increased and there is some
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  Possibility of a possibility of an early
 infiltrate cannot be excluded. No definite upper zone redistribution. No
 effusion.
 
 Superior and inferior vertebral body endplate concavities are seen in 2 lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies, question T9 and T10.  The configuration is
 suggestive of sickle cell.  Increased density in both humeral heads suggestive
 of osteonecrosis is noted, question due to osteonecrosis.
 
 
 Tiny (4.5 mm) density at the left lung apex is again noted, likely a small
 calcified granuloma.  This is unchanged compared with a C-spine CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings and bibasilar atelectasis, without effusion or
 definite upper zone redistribution.  Question due to CHF, though early
 pneumonic infiltrates could account for changes at the bases, particularly on
 the left side.  In the appropriate clinical setting, an interstitial
 infiltrate could have a similar appearance.
 
 Suspect mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 Tiny calcified granuloma at the left lung apex.
