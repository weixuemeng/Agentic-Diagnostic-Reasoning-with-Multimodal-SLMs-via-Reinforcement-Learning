 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Given this, bilateral perihilar and suprahilar
 haziness may be due to slight fluid overload versus technique/patient
 position.No focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinum is
 not widened.
