                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a prolonged cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated, which could be an indication of small airway
 obstruction or even some emphysema, though I do not see any bullae.  Lungs are
 clear of any focal abnormality in the upper lungs, but there may be mild
 bronchiectasis inferiorly, seen best on the lateral view projecting posterior
 to the cardiac silhouette.  Heart size is normal and there is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
