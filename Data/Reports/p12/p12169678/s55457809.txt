                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, endometrial cancer  // eval for PNA, PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right parasternal Port-A-Cath is again noted with its catheter extending
 into the right subclavian vein and its tip in the region of the mid to low
 SVC.  There is new airspace consolidation in the right lower lung which is
 concerning for pneumonia. Also noted, is increased opacity in the right upper
 lobe which could represent pneumonia.  Extensive pulmonary nodules as seen on
 prior CT again noted consistent with endometrial cancer metastasis.   There is
 likely a small right pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  Bilateral percutaneous
 nephrostomy catheters are noted.  Hardware partially noted in the lumbar
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the right upper and lower lungs concerning for pneumonia.
 Innumerable pulmonary nodules are better assessed on prior CT consistent with
 metastasis.  Small right pleural effusion.
