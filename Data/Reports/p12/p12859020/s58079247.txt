 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, chest tightness after shoveling
 snow.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There appears to be
 mild anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Mild anterior wedging of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age.  Recommend
 clinical correlation for acuity.
