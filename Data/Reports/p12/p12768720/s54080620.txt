                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS, lower lobe resection on the right, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the subcutaneous gas has
 resorbed.  Postoperative changes are seen at the right base with blunting of
 the costophrenic angle and fibrotic or atelectatic streaks.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is also seen, as well as apical opacification
 unchanged from prior study.  No evidence of pneumothorax or acute focal
 pneumonia.
