                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male smoker, HIV positive, productive cough, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are borderline hyperinflated, which could be an indication of small
 airway obstruction or early emphysema.  Projecting over the right fourth
 anterior rib laterally are two small nodular opacities, which could be regions
 of benign sclerosis or alternatively small lung nodules.  Lower lungs are
 clear and there is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement or pleural
 abnormality.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Findings do not suggest acute pneumonia, but it is important to see if these
 nodules are genuine and if they persist.  The patient should return in two
 weeks for conventional chest radiographs and chest radiologist should review
 the frontal and lateral films to see if shallow oblique views are needed.
