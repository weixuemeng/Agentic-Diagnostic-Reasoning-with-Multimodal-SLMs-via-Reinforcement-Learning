                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremia with immunosuppression after renal transplant, to assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with previous CABG
 procedure and intact midline sternal wires.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle on the frontal view is not confirmed on the lateral, suggesting pleural
 thickening.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 There is an area of increased opacification at the right base medially.  In
 view of the clinical history, this raises the possibility of developing
 pneumonia.
 
 This information was conveyed to Dr. ___.
