                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with previously x-ray of poor quality,
 now status post intubation, recheck x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of the same day at 12:32 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest shows interval improvement of lung
 ventilation for reduced collapse of the left lung after extubation.  Right
 hemidiaphragm is still significantly elevated compared to the contralateral
 with linear opacity at the right lung base likely due to atelectasis.  Heart
 size is still mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved ventilation for reduced left lung collapsed after
 extubation.  Persistent asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 right lung base atelectasis.
