                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Nasojejunal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is similar mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, although less striking.  The lungs
 appear clear.  A feeding tube courses through the esophagus and visualized
 upper port of the stomach, although its more distal course is not imaged on
 this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Feeding tube passing at least as far as the gastric body, but its
 distal course is not imaged.
