 prominent and indistinct but without frank pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, but less pronounced than before with interval resolution of
 right basilar opacification.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Osteophytes are similar along the lower thoracic spine.
