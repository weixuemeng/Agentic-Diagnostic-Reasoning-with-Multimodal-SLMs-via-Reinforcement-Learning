                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and palpitations.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Of
 note, there is a lucent lesion in the mid left clavicular shaft with
 scalloping of the cortex and no marginal sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  A lucent lesion with cortical
 scalloping in the left clavicle is incompletely evaluated. Dedicated left
 clavicle views are recommended, as well as correlation with history of
 malignancy.
