                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle inferior basilar
 opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view is felt due to likely be
 artifactual or due to atelectasis although there is not a clear correlate on
 the frontal view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 Top normal heart size is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
