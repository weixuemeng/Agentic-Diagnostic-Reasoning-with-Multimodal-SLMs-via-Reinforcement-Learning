                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.  A chest CT is
 also available from ___ and an abdominal CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Bullous changes are similar at the apices.  The lungs are
 mild to moderately hyperinflated.  Although new since earlier studies, there
 has been little if any change in patchy opacities in the right middle and
 lower lobes, streaky in nature with peribronchial cuffing, over the past
 month.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest over the short term, with no clear
 change at all, suggesting that right basilar opacities may indeed be
 associated with chronic scarring or atelectasis.  However, the possibility of
 pneumonia or lower airway infection is hard to completely exclude.
