                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with abnml CT chest  // f/u Right upper lobe
 pneumonia with areas of peripheral air-fluid levels, in location of prior
 bullae, right-sided pleural effusion. Radiology recommendation for chest
 radiograph 6 weeks after to ensure resolution.  As ___, MD, ___
 ___, MD; ___   f/u Right upper lobe pneumonia with areas of
 peripheral air-fluid levels, in location of prior bullae, right-sided pleural
 effusion. Radiology recommendation for chest radiograph 6 weeks after to
 ensure resolution.  As ___ ___, MD, ___, MD; ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs and chest CT ___.
 
 Patient has severe emphysema with very large paraseptal bullae, particularly
 in the upper lobes.  When imaged on ___ he had extensive pneumonia in the
 right upper lobe, with super infection of bullae, containing fluid.  The
 pneumonia has substantially cleared and only a small amount of fluid remains
 in several bullae ; the largest fluid collection has resolved.
 
   There are no other foci of infection in the chest and no layering pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is normal. A patient with emphysema this severe may have
 persistent consolidative abnormalities several months following the Clinical
 resolution of pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If the patient is not symptomatic of continuing or for
 recurrent pneumonia, a repeat chest radiograph can be performed in another 6
 weeks.
