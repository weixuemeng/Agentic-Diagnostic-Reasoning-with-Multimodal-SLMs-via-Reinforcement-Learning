 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the study of ___, there is a new focal opacity in superior
 segment of the right lower lobe.  Additionally in the right lung apex, there

 dense since ___, concerning for additional consolidation or potential
 underlying mass.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with contrast is recommended for further
 evaluation.
