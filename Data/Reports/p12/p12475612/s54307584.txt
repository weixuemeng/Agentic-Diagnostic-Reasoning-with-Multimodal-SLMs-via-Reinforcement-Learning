                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are noted with linear bibasilar opacities, most likely atelectasis. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely due to atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes, noting that infection cannot be entirely excluded.  If
 desired, repeat exam with improved inspiratory effort can be performed.
