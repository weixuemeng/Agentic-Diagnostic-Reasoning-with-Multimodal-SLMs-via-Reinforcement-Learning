                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are low lung volumes which probably
 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There are areas of bilateral
 opacification with a pattern most likely reflecting elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen especially at the right
 base above the mildly elevated hemidiaphragm.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
