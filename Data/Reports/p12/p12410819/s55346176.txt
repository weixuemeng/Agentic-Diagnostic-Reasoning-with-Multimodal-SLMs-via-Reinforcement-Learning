 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Asthma, sarcoid, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial
 change.  The lung volumes have minimally decreased, likely reflecting a lesser
 inspiratory effort.  There is no sign of fibrosis.  Borderline diameter of the
 right hilus, without evidence of abnormal contours or increased density.  No
 micronodules are seen in the lung parenchyma.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Known healed rib
 fractures.
