  The patient is rotated, limiting evaluation.  The right IJ is likely at the
  cavoatrial junction, though due to rotation, it is difficult to tell the exact
  position.  Recommend correlation with a blood gas.  Malpositioned NG tube with
  the tip in the esophogus.  Unchanged left consolidation and volume loss.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:23 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Central venous line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  This examination was presented for review on ___.  Tip of
 the right internal jugular line projects over the mid-to-low SVC.  Nasogastric
 tube is looped in the lower esophagus and ends at the level of the aortic
 arch.  Heart is top normal size, but difficult to assess, because of patient
 rotation, which also obscures the left lower lobe.  Small left pleural
 effusion is likely.  Right lung and right pleural space normal.  No
 pneumothorax.
