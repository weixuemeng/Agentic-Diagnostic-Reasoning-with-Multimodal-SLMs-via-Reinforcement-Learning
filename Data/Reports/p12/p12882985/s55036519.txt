                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Question perforation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Left PICC is no longer visualized.  The
 patient remains rotated to the left.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There
 is dense retrocardiac opacity seen laterally silhouetting the lateral aspect
 of the hemidiaphragm.  Osseous structures are again notable for partially
 visualized lower thoracic spinal hardware which is not well assessed.  No free
 air is seen below the diaphragm on this semi-erect film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacity potentially due to atelectasis noting that infection is
 not excluded.  Consider repeat PA and lateral if the patient is amenable.
