                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumosepsis, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW: Comparison is made to films from ___.
 
 There is extensive consolidation in the left mid and lower zones, with air
 bronchograms seen in the retrocardiac region.  This appears slightly denser
 and more confluent in the left mid zone compared with ___ film from
 19:23 p.m.  This area is partially excluded from the subsequent film from
 ___:16 p.m.  There is relative sparing of the left upper zone. Possibility of
 some volume loss on the left cannot be excluded, but the appearance is similar
 to the prior film. The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.    
 
 Right IJ central line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  Spinal fixation
 hardware is again noted.  Also again seen is a small metallic density adjacent
 to the right vertical spinal rod, but separate from it, more completely
 characterized on the torso CT from ___.  
 
 Compared to the latter of the two ___ films, the tubing overlying the upper
 mediastinum in the midline is no longer visualized.
