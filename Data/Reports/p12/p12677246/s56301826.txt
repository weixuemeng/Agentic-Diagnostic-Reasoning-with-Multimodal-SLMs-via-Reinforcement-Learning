 Left bronchial stent, sternal wires and upper mediastinal drain remain in
 place.  There are stable mediastinal postoperative changes is well. Interval
 decrease in degree of pneumomediastinum. There is left apical soft tissue
 which may represent an apical cap, which is not an unexpected finding given
 recent tracheal surgery.  There also continues to be some volume loss on the
 left given persistent mediastinal shift to the left likely reflecting a
 component of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is appreciated. Continued followup
 imaging would be recommended.
