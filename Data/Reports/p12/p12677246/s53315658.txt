                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheal stent  // sp tracheal stent
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 08:38
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been interval addition of the distal trachea
 stent to already pre-existing left main bronchus stent. Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable. Right basal opacity has developed and might
 potentially reflect interval aspiration, attention on the subsequent study is
 recommended. No interval development of pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
 seen.  The patient did demonstrate persistent decrease in volume of the left
 hemothorax most likely related to prior surgery.
