 volumes remain low.  There is subsegmental bilateral lower lung atelectasis,
 not significantly changed.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 slightly increased.  There is new mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are more conspicuous than before.

 from earlier today.
 
 2.  Slight increase in moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
