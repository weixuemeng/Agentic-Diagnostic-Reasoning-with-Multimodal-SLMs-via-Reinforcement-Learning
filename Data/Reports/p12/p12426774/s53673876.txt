                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with anasarca, question signs of CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Due to
 large body habitus, views are somewhat underpenetrated.  Allowing for this,
 there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No definite signs
 of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Old right posterior rib
 deformities are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of CHF.
