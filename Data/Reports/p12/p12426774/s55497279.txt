                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post cardiac arrest, with chest pain. 
 Evaluate for evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated.  There is slight increase in hilar
 prominence likely due to vascular engorgement.  There is stable blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle.  The left costophrenic sulcus is unremarkable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged from prior. 
 The blunting of the right pleural sulcus is stable from prior study and is
 likely related to scarring.  Changes in the right seventh posterior rib are
 also unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
