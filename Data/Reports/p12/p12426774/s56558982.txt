                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness, rigors.  The patient with end-stage renal disease, on
 hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the upper atrium as before.  The
 heart is again moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is again perihilar fullness and hazy central pulmonary
 vascularity which suggests mild vascular congestion that appears unchanged. 
 Mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left is
 similar.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild background fluid overload with
 perhaps a slight increase.
