                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the single-lead pacer device
 extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  What appear to be
 epicardial leads are seen on the left.  Evidence of previous rib fractures and
 possibly some fibrosis in the left mid to lower zone with blunting of the
 costophrenic angles.  No vascular congestion and the left lung is clear.
