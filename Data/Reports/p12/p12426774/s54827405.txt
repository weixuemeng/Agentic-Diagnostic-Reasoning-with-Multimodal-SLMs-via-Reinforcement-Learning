                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.  Patient with end-stage renal disease.  Question
 volume overload or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the upper right atrium.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a diffuse interstitial abnormality suggesting
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Particularly in the left retrocardiac
 region, there is more focal opacification of uncertain significance, but
 possibly superimposed atelectasis or even pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are noted along the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe could be associated with the same
 process, but since it somewhat focal, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 atelectasis or even pneumonia could be considered.
