 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright

 similar study of ___.  Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement is
 present but not different in size in comparison to the previous study. 
 Unchanged appearance of the mildly widened and elongated but heavily wall
 calcified thoracic aorta.  No suspicion for new aneurysmatic formations.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation.  Lateral view demonstrates
 again accentuated kyphotic curvature in the demineralized thoracic spine with
 at least two wedge compressed vertebral bodies, similar as seen on previous
 examinations.

 elderly patient, but no evidence of acute pulmonary congestion or pulmonary
 edema.  No acute new parenchymal infiltrates.
