                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increasing shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is
 upper zone redistribution that may be consistent with mild vascular
 engorgement.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view
 demonstrates unchanged compression fracture of lower thoracic/upper lumbar
 bodies as well as of mid thoracic vertebral body.
