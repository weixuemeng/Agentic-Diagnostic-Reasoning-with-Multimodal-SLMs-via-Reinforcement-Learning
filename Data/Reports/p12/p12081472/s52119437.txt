 pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal consolidation.  Hilar contours are
 stable.  Degenerative changes of bilateral shoulder and acromioclavicular
 joints are seen.  There is also stable compression/anterior wedging deformity
 laterally to the vertebral bodies, 1 in the mid thoracic spine and 1 at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
