                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position.  Opacity
 in the left lower lobe has slightly improved and most likely represents
 improving atelectasis with adjacent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. 
 No new areas of consolidation are evident in the remainder of the lungs to
 suggest a new source of infection.
