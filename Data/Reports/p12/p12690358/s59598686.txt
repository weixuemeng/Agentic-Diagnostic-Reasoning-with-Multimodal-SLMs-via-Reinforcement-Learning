                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic colon cancer, right pleural effusion,
 metastatic deposits in the right lower lobe, tachycardia, recurrent right
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTPA from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been little change in comparison to prior radiograph from ___.  Again visualized is opacification of the right lung base due to the
 presence of pleural and pulmonary metastases as well as atelectasis.
 Right-sided pleural effusion is again present, likely slightly larger in size
 compared to the prior study given increased haziness in the right upper lung
 field. Determination of the exact size of the effusion is difficult given the
 presence of the right basilar necrotic metastases, and the effusion has
 multiple loculated components as seen on the prior CT. Multiple nodular
 opacities are visualized in the right upper lobe and appear enlarged in
 comparison to prior study likely representing pleural and parenchymal
 metastases.  The left lung remains clear.  Heart size remains normal. 
 Mild-to-moderate dextroscoliosis of the mid thoracic spine remains unchanged.
 Previously noted left PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided pleural effusion is likley slightly larger in size, which appears
 loculated laterally and apically. No significant interval change in
 opacification of the right lung base due to the presence of pleural and
 pulmonary metastases as well as atelectasis.  Nodular opacities in the right
 upper lobe appear larger compared to prior, likely representing metastases.
