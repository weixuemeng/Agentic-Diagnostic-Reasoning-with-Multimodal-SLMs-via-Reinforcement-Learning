                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lower thoracic spinal fusion hardware is unchanged.  The heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.  Mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Increasing opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is seen and may
 correlate to either a dual density projecting over the anterior heart or the
 spine on lateral view.  Additionally a focus of plate atelectasis is seen in
 the right mid lung.  Mild new pulmonary vascular prominence suggests mild
 congestion.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right cardiophrenic angle opacity; in the appropriate
 clinical setting may represent pneumonia.  Findings also suggesting mild
 vascular congestion.
