 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has increased since the prior exam.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is present.  A small left pleural effusion is identified. 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum may relate to vascular engorgement.  A
 small amount of pleural fluid is seen in the right minor fissure.  Left
 lateral thoracic spinal fusion and intervertebral cage spacer display no
 evidence of hardware-related complication.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild CHF.
