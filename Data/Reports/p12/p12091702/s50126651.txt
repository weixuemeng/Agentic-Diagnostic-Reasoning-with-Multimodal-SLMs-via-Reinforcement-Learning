 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bronchiectasis, no pleuritic pain, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing areas of
 massive overinflation, scarring and bronchiectatic changes are constant. 
 However, there is a zone of new parenchymal opacity appeared in the aspects
 lateral to the lower part of the left hilus.  In the appropriate setting, the
 changes could be indicative of infectious changes.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is constant as appeared to the previous exam.
