                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchiectasis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate mild
 opacification likely in the lingula.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 this could represent pneumonia.  Compared to the prior radiograph, this is
 new.  Otherwise, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Additionally, hyperinflation of the lung is again seen with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  No pleural abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left lung, likely the lingula, which in the
 appropriate clinical setting may represent pneumonia.
 
 These findings were relayed to Dr. ___, at 5:05 p.m. on the day of the
 examination.
