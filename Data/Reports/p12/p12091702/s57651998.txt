                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and malaise. h/o bronchiectasis  //
 r/o new infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperexpanded. Multi focal airway centric abnormalities in the mid
 and lower lungs appear relatively similar to the prior study. However, an
 ill-defined opacity in the left apex posteriorly is apparently new. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. No definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New poorly defined left apical opacities, which could represent an acute
 bacterial infection or exacerbation of chronic MAC infection. Consider
 short-term followup radiographs after antibiotic therapy if clinical features
 are consistent with acute bacterial infection. Alternatively, CT may be
 considered for more complete characterization.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 16:20 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
