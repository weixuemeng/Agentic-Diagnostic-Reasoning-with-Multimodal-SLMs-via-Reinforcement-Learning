                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To rule out pneumothorax, status post placement of fiducials in a
 left upper lobe mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 14:31 hours.
 
 PA AND LATERAL UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A small left apical pneumothorax
 has minimally increased since the prior study.  A 3.1 cm left upper lobe mass
 with fiducial markers is worrisome for malignancy. Opacities in the right
 upper lobe surrounding the fiducial markers, relate to previously treated lung
 cancer.  There are no pleural effusions.  Stable mild cardiomegaly and
 tortuous thoracic aorta are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left apical pneumothorax, slightly larger since today's
 earlier study.
