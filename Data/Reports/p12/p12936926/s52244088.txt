                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of glioblastoma resection, now
 presenting with confusion and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is hyperinflation of the lungs,
 which is unchanged from prior.  Linear opacities in the left lung base
 correspond with atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation is identified.  There
 is no vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No large effusions are evident.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  On the lateral
 projection, there is a linear lucency posterior to the sternum which is of
 uncertain etiology, though pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded.  Followup
 inspiratory and expiratory radiographs are recommended for further
 characterization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear lucency posterior to the sternum on the lateral projection of
 uncertain etiology.  Pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  Followup radiographs
 are recommended.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
