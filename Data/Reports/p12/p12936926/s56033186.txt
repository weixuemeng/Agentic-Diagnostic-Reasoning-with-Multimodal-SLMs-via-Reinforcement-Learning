                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of glioblastoma, now with worsening
 confusion, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is rotated to the right, which
 limits evaluation of the mediastinum.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits and unchanged allowing for positional differences from
 the prior study of ___.  Hyperinflation of the lungs is again seen with
 emphysematous changes at the bilateral lung apices and left apical calcified
 granuloma, stable in appearance.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
