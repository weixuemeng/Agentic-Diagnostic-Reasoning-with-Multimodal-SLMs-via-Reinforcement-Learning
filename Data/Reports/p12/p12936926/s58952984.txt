                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior study from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Inspiratory expiration films for possible pneumothorax,
 questioned on prior chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Inspiration and expiration chest radiograph.  PA views were
 provided.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  A dense nodule in the left upper lung
 is likely a calcified granuloma.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of pneumothorax.
