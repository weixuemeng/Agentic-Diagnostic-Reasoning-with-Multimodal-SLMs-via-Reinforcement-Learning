                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pancreatitis, GDA aneurysm and rupture,
 intubated, weaning PEEP very slowly  // interval change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is still
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the left base
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe and pleural fluid.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would
 be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
