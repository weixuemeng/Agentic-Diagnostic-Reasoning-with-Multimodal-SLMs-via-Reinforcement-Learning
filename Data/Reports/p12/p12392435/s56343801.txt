                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is a tubular structure
 that projects over the upper right hemithorax, unclear whether internal or
 external to the patient, though most likely represents a right-sided VP shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
