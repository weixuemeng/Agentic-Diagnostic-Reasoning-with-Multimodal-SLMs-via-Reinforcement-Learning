 new dobhoff placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes
 that accentuate the size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous pressure. 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 There has been placement of a Dobhoff tube, with the opaque portion just
 distal to the esophagogastric junction.  The tube could be pushed forward
 about 8-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
