                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, metastatic lung cancer with new shortness of breath and oxygen
 requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated from ___ through
 every ___ ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval worsening of chronic right pleural effusion and right
 lower lung collapse now with a moderate to large effusion, collapse of the
 right middle and right lower lobe, and heterogeneous opacity throughout the
 remainder of the right lung.  A 2.1 cm nodule in the left lung apex is
 compatible with known malignancy.  The remainder of the left lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal contour is not readily assessed due to opacification of much
 of the right hemithorax.  Thoracic stabilization hardware is unchanged in
 position.  Known thoracic vertebral fractures are not well assessed on this a
 portable frontal radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle and lower lobe collapse with large right effusion and
 heterogeneous densities in the remainder of the right lung likely representing
 chronic right lower lung postobstructive atelectasis with superimposed
 pneumonia.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
 ___ at 16:48 on ___ at time of initial review.
