 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Mitral insufficiency, evaluation for pulmonary edema or other
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 pneumonia.  Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. 
 The partly ruptured sternal wires are seen in unchanged alignment.
