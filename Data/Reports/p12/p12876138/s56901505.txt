                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable frontal views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided central venous catheter is seen terminating in the
 region of the right atrium.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, which have significantly worsened since
 the prior study.  Underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude,
 particularly in the right perihilar region.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with the superior most sternal
 wire again seen to be fractured.
 
 The previously seen right-sided PICC is no longer seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and mild cardiac
 enlargement suggests CHF, worsened since prior.
