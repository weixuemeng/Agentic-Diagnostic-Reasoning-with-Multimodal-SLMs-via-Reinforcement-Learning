                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of ST elevation MI.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings at the lung bases.  Given this, no focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
