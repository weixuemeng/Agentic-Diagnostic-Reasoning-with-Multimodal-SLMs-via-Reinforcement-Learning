                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and abdominal pain.  Question pneumonia or free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is cardiomegaly accompanied by vascular engorgement and
 pulmonary edema.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion which may have some
 loculated components.  Alternatively, this may represent soft tissue shadows
 or pleural thickening.  Left pleural effusion is small if any, and there is
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumonia.  Severe
 scoliosis of the lumbar spine is partially imaged with surgical hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in chronic moderate ardiomegaly with likely acute
 pulmonary edema and non dependent right pleural effusion.
