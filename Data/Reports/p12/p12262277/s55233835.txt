                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, COPD, worsening hypoxia  //
 pulmonary edema, cause for worsened hypoxia
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 00:40.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A large area of consolidation at the base the left lung has worsened
 dramatically since midnight, with relatively little change at the right base
 and only mild vascular engorgement throughout the lungs. Therefore asymmetric
 edema is much less likely than fulminant pneumonia, probably aspiration,
 alternatively, but also less likely, pulmonary hemorrhage.  Heart is
 top-normal size. Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Small left pleural
 effusion has probably increased.  No pneumothorax.
