                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening cough, poor air movement
 bilateral, worst on left
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears at least mild to moderately enlarged, though difficult to
 assess given the presence of moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right. The size of these effusions appears increased compared to
 the previous exam. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well as
 patchy opacities in the lung bases, most likely bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. The mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, and
 increased from the prior study. Compressive bibasilar atelectasis. Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
