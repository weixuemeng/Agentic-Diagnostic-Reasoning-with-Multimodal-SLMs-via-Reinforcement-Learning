                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vagal nerve stimulator placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided vagal nerve stimulator device is noted with lead coursing cephalad
 into the neck, and the tip appears to be coiled within the left aspect of the
 lower neck.  A right-sided VP shunt catheter is present with the tip
 terminating in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Lung volumes are low with
 streaky opacities at the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  No acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided vagal nerve stimulator device is new, with lead appearing to
 terminate in the left lower neck.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with streaky opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis.
