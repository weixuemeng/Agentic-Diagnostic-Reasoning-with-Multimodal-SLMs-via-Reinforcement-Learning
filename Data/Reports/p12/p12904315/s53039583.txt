 Compared to prior, there is increased interstitial opacities with linear
 thickened septal lines and right hilar opacities, concerning for mild
 pulmonary edema.  Right mid lung opacity may represent atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia.  Focal opacity on the left mid lung is likely
 atelectasis.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusion as likely.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable and have expected
 postop appearance.  Aortic valve replacement is seen.  Multiple wedge
 deformities of the thoracic spine and severe kyphosis is again seen, unchanged
 from preop evaluation.  Severe osteoarthritic changes of the right shoulder is
 again seen.
