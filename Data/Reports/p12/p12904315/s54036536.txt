                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with progressive dyspnea, POD#___ s/p CABG w aortic valve
 replacement, evaluate for pulmonary mid.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nodular opacity in the right mid lung is unchanged from prior studies,
 likely representing stable atelectasis.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the
 peripheral left lung is also unchanged.  There are small pleural effusions
 bilaterally.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without frank
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, including moderate cardiomegaly, is unchanged. 
 Median sternotomy wires, multiple mediastinal clips, and a prosthetic aortic
 valve are noted.  Chronic appearing left-sided rib fractures and severe
 osteoarthritic changes of the right shoulder are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged areas of subsegmental atelectasis with mild vascular congestion but
 no frank pulmonary edema.
