                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  A right
 subclavian central line tip is again seen, in the region of the SVC/RA
 junction.  
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  There is upper zone redistribution, which could
 relate to low inspiratory volumes, but no overt CHF.  There is focal opacity
 in the right cardiophrenic region, similar to prior.  While this could
 represent atelectasis, it raises the question of a focal pneumonic opacity. 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Some focal opacity at the left cardiac
 apex is seen, ? residua from prior opacity.  There is mild increased
 retrocardiac density.  In addition, there appears to be tortuosity of the
 aortic contour.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 UZRD. Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region. Both findings may be
 exacerbated by low inspiratory volumes, but the possibility of a right
 cardiophrenic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
