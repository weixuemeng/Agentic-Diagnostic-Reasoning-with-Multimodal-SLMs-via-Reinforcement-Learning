                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with alcoholic hepatitis, renal failure, and new
 oxygen requirement.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is persistent bilateral
 diffuse interstitial abnormality, which is not significantly changed from the
 prior study, and likely represents moderate pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.  A right-sided internal
 jugular central venous line ends in the mid SVC.  Left-sided wide bore central
 venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema without relevant change.
