                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with alcoholic hepatitis, renal failure.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
 opacification at the right lung base, likely a combination of pleural effusion
 and pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Right-sided internal jugular central venous line
 ends at the upper SVC.  A large bore left internal jugular central venous line
 ends in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacification at the right lung base, likely a
 combination of pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Recommend PA and lateral
 chest radiographs to exclude artifacts of supine positioning and further
 evaluate for possible underlying pneumonia.
