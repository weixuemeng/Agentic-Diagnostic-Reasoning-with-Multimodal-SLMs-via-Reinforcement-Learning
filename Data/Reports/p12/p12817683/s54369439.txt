 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:02 AM
  
  
  
  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged heart, similar
  appearance when compared to radiograph obtained 2 days prior. No large pleural
  effusion is identified. A left internal jugular central line is identified
  terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low which results in
  bronchovascular crowding. No overt pulmonary edema is identified. No focal
  consolidation convincing for pneumonia is seen.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal transplant and RP bleed s/p 5unit
 blood products now s/p HD x 2 and SOB with question of pulm edema  // ? pulm
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette unchanged recently, due to
 cardiomegaly and/or large pericardial effusion. A small triangular projecting
 just above the opacity in the right lower lobe diaphragmatic surface, is new
 since ___, unchanged since ___. It could be a focus of infection
 or infarction. Lungs are otherwise clear. The mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement improved since ___, stable since ___ and the stable
 dilatation of the mediastinal veins indicate probable hypervolemia but not
 frank heart failure. Pleural effusions are small if any. A dual channel left
 supraclavicular central venous line ends in the low SVC.
