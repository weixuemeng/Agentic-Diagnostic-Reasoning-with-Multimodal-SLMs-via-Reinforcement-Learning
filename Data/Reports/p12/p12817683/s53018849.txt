                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p kidney transplant now with cough, urti for 3
 weeks  // cough, urti, rule out pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The extent of its enlargement and particularly the shape of the cardiac
 silhouette have fluctuated substantially since ___. Today the heart shadow is
 larger than ever before. The configuration could be due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vessels are greatly engorged, but I do not see
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Large hila and a bulge in the mediastinum
 in the region of the pulmonary outflow tract could be vascular or adenopathy.
 
 Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases could be atelectasis alone or
 small areas of consolidation. A 13 mm wide oval opacity projecting over the
 anterior aspect of the left fourth rib might be a pulmonary nodule.
 
 All of these are uncertain observations would be clarified by a chest CT
 scanning.
