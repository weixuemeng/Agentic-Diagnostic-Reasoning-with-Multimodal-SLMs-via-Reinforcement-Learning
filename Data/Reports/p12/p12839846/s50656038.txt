                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea // pneumothorax size
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:58 and CT torso ___ at 17:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight asymmetric lucency overlying the right lung base with a deep sulcus
 sign likely reflects the small right pneumothorax seen on CT and appears
 similar compared to the previous chest radiograph.  Lung volumes remain low
 with patchy opacities in the lung bases, compatible with atelectasis on the
 left and contusion with atelectasis on the right.  Cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  No evidence of mediastinal shift. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better
 assessed on the recent CT.  Right humeral head remains anteriorly dislocated
 and a right scapular fracture is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pneumothorax is likely not substantially changed allowing for
 differences in technique.
