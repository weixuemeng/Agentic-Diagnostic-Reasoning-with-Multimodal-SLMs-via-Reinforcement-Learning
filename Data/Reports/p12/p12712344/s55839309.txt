 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:09 PM
  
  1. Again seen is a large gastric air bubble.
  2. Low lung volumes.
  3. Stable appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouettes.
  4. Right chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip projecting over the right atrium,
  as on prior.
  5. Left-greater-than-right airspace opacities are similar in appearance to
  prior chest x-ray, likely reflective of pulmonary vascular congestion and
  pulmonary edema, however again infection cannot be excluded in the correct
  clinical setting.
  6. Overall, no appreciable interval change.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bleomycin induced lung toxicity, with
 hypoxic respiratory failure  // any interval change?     any interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since early ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been very little change in the mid multifocal infiltrative pulmonary
 abnormality always worsened in the left lung.  Also unchanged is the severely
 distended stomach.  Previous moderate cardiomegaly may have improved.  Pleural
 effusion if any is minimal.
 
 Question was raised at Conference yesterday about possibility of a left
 pneumothorax at the apex.  Today that possible in air collection is smaller,
 but there is a suggestion of either pneumomediastinum or medial pneumothorax. 
 Chest CT scanning would be a the clarify these findings.
 
 The indwelling
 right jugular central venous infusion port ends in the right atrium, as
 before.
