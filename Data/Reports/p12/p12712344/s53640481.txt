                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with possible cervical spine pathologic fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a round 5.6 cm density along the left lung base anteriorly and is
 likely pleural based. There is loss of the cortical margins of the anterior
 left sixth rib adjacent to this mass which is worrisome underlying osseous
 destruction. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema is
 seen. The heart is normal in size. There is an abnormal contour seen just
 superior to the aortic arch not clearly localized on the lateral view
 worrisome for underlying abnormality, potentially adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 5.6 cm round density at the left anterior lung base with probable associated
 destruction of the anterolateral left sixth rib raising concern for aggressive
 lesion. Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.   Abnormal contour just
 superior to the aortic arch which can also be followed up at time of CT scan.
