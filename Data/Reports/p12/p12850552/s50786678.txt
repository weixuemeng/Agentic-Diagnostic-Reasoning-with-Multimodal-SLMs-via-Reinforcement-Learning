                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Generalized weakness, assess for acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Low lung volumes
 limit evaluation, as does the large body habitus.  There is no overt pneumonia
 or CHF.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, impossible to exclude.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size appears within normal limits. 
 Subtle hyperdensity in the region of the mitral annulus may reflect mitral
 annular calcification.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study with possible mild congestion and mitral annular
 calcification.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
