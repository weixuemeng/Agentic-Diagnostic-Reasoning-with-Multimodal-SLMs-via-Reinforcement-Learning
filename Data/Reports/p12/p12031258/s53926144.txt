                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 FINDINGS:  A subtle 3.3 cm diameter rounded cystic lesion is present in the
 left infrahilar region, corresponding to a focal abnormality in the superior
 segment left lower lobe detected on recent CT thoracic spine study of one day
 earlier.  Lungs are otherwise clear except for a small calcified granuloma in
 the left lower lobe.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe superior segment lesion corresponds to an
 abnormality on recent CT thoracic spine of one day earlier.  Although possibly
 due to a nodular focus of consolidation from aspiration or contusion, followup
 radiographs are recommended in six to eight weeks to document resolution.  If
 this fails to resolve radiographically, a followup CT would be recommended, as
 the differential diagnosis for this finding includes lung adenocarcinoma.
