 Both of the lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Retrocardiac opacity
 may be secondary to atelectasis. Elsewhere the lungs are grossly clear. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits given low inspiratory
 effort. Degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joints.

 Low lung volumes with left basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis noting
 that infection is not entirely excluded.
