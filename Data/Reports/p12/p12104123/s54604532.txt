                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cellulitis with new hypoxia. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved. The cardiac silhouette is still mildly enlarged.
 The mediastinal hilar contours are normal. Subsegmental atelectasis persists
 at both lung bases. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely
 suggestive of a small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 new focal consolidation is noted. There is no frank pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and small left pleural effusion
 are nonspecific findings.  Although attributable to pancreatitis, clinical
 consideration should be given to acute and/or subacute pulmonary embolism.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 9:04 AM, 15 minutes after discovery of the findings.
