                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cellulitis with new hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged, but accentuated due
 to low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases are
 compatible with areas of atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle suggests a small left pleural effusion, unchanged. There is
 no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and trace left pleural effusion, similar compared to the
 prior exam.
