                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status and lower extremity
 edema.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right paramediastinal opacity is noted.
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged
 without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.  Multilevel loss of vertebral height is
 seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  
 2.  Right upper paramediastinal opacity could be due to tortuous vessels, but
 CT is recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 Findings and recommendations emailed to the ED QA nurses at 9:38pm ___
 after attending review.
