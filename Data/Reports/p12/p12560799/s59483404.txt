                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval development of a moderate size right pleural effusion.
 Right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis or infection. Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of the pleural effusion but is likely
 unchanged and within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Left lung is
 clear. There is no pneumothorax. Multilevel degenerative changes along with
 levoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate sized right pleural effusion. Right basilar opacity could reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.
