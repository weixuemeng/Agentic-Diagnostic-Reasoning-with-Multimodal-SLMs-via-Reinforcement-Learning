                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left ventricular device with chest pain and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Dual-lead left-sided
 AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  A left ventricular assist device is in
 place, similar in position.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  As noted in the prior study, there is right base, possibly right
 middle lobe opacity which actually appears decreased as compared to the prior
 study but persistent and could be due to underlying consolidation from
 pneumonia or aspiration; there may be an associated small right pleural
 effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in position or appearance of the left
 ventricular assist device.  Persistent but decrease in right mid-to-lower lung
 opacity which could have been due to consolidation from infection or
 aspiration or atelectasis.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful
 for further evaluation.  Suggest followup to resolution.  
 
 No overt pulmonary edema.
