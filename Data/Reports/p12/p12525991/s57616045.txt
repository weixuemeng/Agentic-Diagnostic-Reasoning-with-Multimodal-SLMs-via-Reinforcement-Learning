                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea with new left ventricular assist device.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral
 pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A
 left ventricular assist device is in place and unchanged in position.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  A more hazy opacity seen at the
 right lung base is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Hazy opacity at the right lung base may reflect atelectasis, although,
 pneumonia should be considered.  
 2.  Unchanged appearance of the left ventricular assist device.
