                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MIE  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs between ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Midline drain and right thoracostomy tube appear unchanged in position.
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild, and unchanged.  No focal parenchymal
 consolidation.  Small left pleural effusion is stable.  No pleural effusion on
 the right.  Oval-shaped lucency at the right lung base most likely represents
 pneumoperitoneum, although a small subpulmonic pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded.  Expected postoperative appearance of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No significant interval change in mild vascular congestion and small left
 effusion.
 2. Additional ovoid lucency at the right lung base may represent either
 subdiaphragmatic or subpulmonic free air.
