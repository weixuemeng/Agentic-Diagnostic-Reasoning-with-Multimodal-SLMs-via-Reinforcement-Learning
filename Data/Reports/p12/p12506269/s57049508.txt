                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with portal hypertension secondary to
 schistosomiasis and history of TB for 12 months with fevers and abdominal
 pain.  Question positive, active tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Linear opacity in the right mid lung is most suggestive
 of atelectasis versus scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis.
