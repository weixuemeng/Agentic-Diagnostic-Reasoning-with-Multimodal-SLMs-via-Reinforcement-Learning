                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall and seizure  // Eval for rib fracture
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   Dual lead pacer is noted with pacer
 pack projecting over the left chest wall and leads extending to the region of
 the right atrium and right ventricle. Predominately left-sided calcified
 pleural plaque is noted likely accounting for the opacity projecting over the
 lateral aspect of the left lower lung. Evaluation for a subtle pneumonia in
 this area is therefore limited. Otherwise, no signs of pneumonia. No supine
 evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal. Chronic right rib deformities are noted involving the fourth, fifth,
 sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic right rib cage deformities. Calcified pleural plaque.  Pacemaker in
 appropriate position.
 
 If there is strong clinical concern for an acute fracture, recommend dedicated
 rib series with a BB marking the site of maximal pain.
