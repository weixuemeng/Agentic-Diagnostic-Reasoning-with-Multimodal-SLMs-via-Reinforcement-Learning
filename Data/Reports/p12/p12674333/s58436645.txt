                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assault.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate the cardiac size, which may still be enlarged, as
 well as contribute to minimal basilar atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumonia, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  No fractures are
 identified on this nondedicated film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Chest radiography is
 nonsensitive for bony abnormalities and dedicated views should be obtained if
 indicated.
