 located 4.7 cm above the carina.  Lung volumes are low with scattered
 subsegmental atelectasis in the left upper and lower lobes.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal contour appears
 somewhat prominent, likely technique related.  Bony structures appear grossly
 intact.

 subsegmental atelectasis and top normal heart size.
