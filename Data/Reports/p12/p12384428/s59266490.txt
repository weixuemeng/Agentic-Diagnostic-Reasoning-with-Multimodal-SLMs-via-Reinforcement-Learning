                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST,  ___ AT 10:25 A.M.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Transvenous pacing lead continues to terminate in the right
 ventricle.  Other indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Overall appearance of the chest is not appreciably changed since
 the recent study of less than three hours earlier, allowing for differences in
 positioning of the patient.
