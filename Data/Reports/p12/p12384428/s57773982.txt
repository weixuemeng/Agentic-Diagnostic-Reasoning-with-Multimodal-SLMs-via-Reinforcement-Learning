                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male going for PEG tube placement.  Assess nasoenteric
 catheter position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A nasoenteric catheter tip terminates in
 the stomach.  A pacemaker generator and single right-ventricular lead appear
 in unchanged expected position.  There are persistent moderate bibasilar
 opacities, likely a combination of moderate effusions and atelectasis.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged from prior.  There is stable mild
 elevation of the minor fissure with a small amount of fluid layering within
 it, unchanged from prior.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasoenteric catheter tip within the stomach.
 2.  Unchanged probable bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 atelectasis.
