                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with cough; question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiograph from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is widespread hazy indistinct
 opacification of the upper lungs as well as the right lower lung, and at the
 right lung base in particularly, Kerley B lines can be appreciated.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity obscures the medial left heart border and it is difficult
 to exclude a small pleural effusion on the left, noting blunting also seen
 along the left costophrenic sulcus.  Heterogeneous pulmonary architecture is
 concerning for emphysema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacification, for which pulmonary edema
 superimposed on abnormal pulmonary architecture could be considered, since
 emphysema is suspected.  Multifocal pneumonia could also be considered. 
 Opacities are overall similar in distribution but more prominent.
