                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with single-chamber pacemaker, confirm lead position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  An orogastric tube remains in place with it coursing below the diaphragm
 and the tip not identified on the current study.  Interval placement of a
 single-lead left-sided pacer with the lead terminating over the expected
 location of the right ventricle.  There are bilateral layering effusions which
 has increased on the left when compared to the previous study.  Associated
 bibasilar airspace disease is seen which in the setting of extensive
 emphysema, may reflect worsening pulmonary edema rather than bibasilar
 atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The heart
 remains stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
