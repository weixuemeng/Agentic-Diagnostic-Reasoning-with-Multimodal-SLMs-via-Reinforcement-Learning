                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with transvenous pacing wire, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New right-sided transvenous pacer via jugular vein is in adequate position in
 the right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left moderate pleural
 effusion is stable with left lower lobe collapse.  Bilateral perihilar
 ground-glass opacity compatible with severe pulmonary edema is mostly
 unchanged.  NG tube is in the stomach.  ET tube ends 5.3 cm above carina. 
 Dilatation of pulmonary artery is stable, probably related to pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New transvenous pacer ends in right ventricle.  There is no complication. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Severe pulmonary edema is unchanged.
