                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS, hypotension
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low.
 Left basal opacity may represent atelectasis. There is coarsened interstitial
 markings which could reflect chronic lung disease. Curvilinear coarse
 calcification projecting over the heart likely corresponds with the mitral
 annulus. The heart size cannot be reliably assessed due to low lung volumes.
 The mediastinal contour appears normal. There is an area of increased opacity
 at the right lung apex medially raising concern for underlying lesion versus
 vascular ectasia. Bony structures appear intact. Grossly unremarkable. Clips
 in the upper abdomen noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right apical opacity, question vascular ectasia versus underlying lesion.
 2. Coarsened lung markings raise concern for interstitial lung disease.
 3. Calcification of the mitral annulus.
  Nonemergent CT is recommended to further assess.
 Limited exam given low lung volumes.
