                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aortic stenosis, abd pain, worsening WBC,
 increased volume status  // Eval for pneumonia, pul edema     Eval for
 pneumonia, pul edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the pulmonary edema has
 substantially decreased.  The hazy opacification of the right hemithorax is no
 longer appreciated.  This could reflect substantial improvement in the pleural
 effusion, though some of this could merely be a manifestation of a more
 upright position of the patient.  Opacification at the left base is consistent
 with small effusion.  There are bilateral atelectatic changes.
