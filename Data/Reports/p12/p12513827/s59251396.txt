 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF  // any interval change      any
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobhoff tube has been removed. 
 Otherwise, there is little overall change.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications again could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema.  However, the
 combination of striking asymmetry and more coalescent areas of opacification
 throughout much of the right hemithorax would be worrisome for widespread
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
