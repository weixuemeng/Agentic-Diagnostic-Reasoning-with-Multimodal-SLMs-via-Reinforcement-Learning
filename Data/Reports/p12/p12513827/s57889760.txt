                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest (4 examinations)
 
 INDICATION:  Assess feeding tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 4 successive frontal chest radiographs performed 08:47, 08:54, 08:58, and
 09:01, show insertion and successive repositioning of the esophageal feeding
 tube, first in the left main bronchus, then the mid esophagus, then, on the
 final view, in the upper stomach, with the wire stylet in place.
 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion, small left pleural effusion persist, and left
 lower lobe is severely consolidated or collapsed.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion persists.  Pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is no worse, but change is difficult to assess because of
 differences in patient positioning.  There is probably no pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
