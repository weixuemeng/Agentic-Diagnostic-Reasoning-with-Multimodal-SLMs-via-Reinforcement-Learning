                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Positive PPD.  Question active tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is an entirely unchanged patchy opacity in the right
 upper lobe since the prior radiographs with volume loss in the right upper
 lobe and streaky opacification radiating from the upper right hilum, the
 latter better appreciated on the lateral view.  This appearance is stable and
 most suggestive of sequelae of prior tuberculosis.  Streaky right mid lung
 opacity is compatible with minor unchanged scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of prior tuberculosis with stable associated
 opacities in the right upper lobe.
