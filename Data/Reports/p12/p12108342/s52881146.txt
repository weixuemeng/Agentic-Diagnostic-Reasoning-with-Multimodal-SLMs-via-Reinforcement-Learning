                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, a very small right
 apical lateral pneumothorax is unchanged in appearance.  Slightly improved
 aeration in the right lower lobe is noted with decreased elevation and
 improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the prior study.
 Opacities at the operative site have minimally improved as well.  Widespread
 ground-glass and reticular opacities persist and may be related to the
 patient's known diffuse interstitial lung disease process.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema is again demonstrated in the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged very small right apicolateral pneumothorax following
 chest tube removal.
