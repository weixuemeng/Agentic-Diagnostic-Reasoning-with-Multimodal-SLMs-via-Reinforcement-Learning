                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Status post recent VATS surgery, presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  The lung volumes appear low.  There is
 no definite persistent visualization of a previously noted tiny pneumothorax,
 although there is persistent but somewhat decreased subcutaneous emphysema
 lying outside of the chest wall and tracking into the base of the right neck. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion.  Thickening of the right major fissure
 appears unchanged, however.  Diffuse hazy and reticular opacities appear
 unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar widespread moderate pulmonary abnormality with low lung
 volumes.  No definite persistent visualization of small pneumothorax.  No
 evidence for substantial pleural effusion.
