                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low in volume with
 linear bibasilar atelectasis.  Trace blunting of the costophrenic sulci on the
 lateral view could reflect pleural effusion or chronic pleural thickening. 
 The heart is top normal in size with postsurgical changes from aortic valve
 replacement and CABG noted. Aorta remains tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions vs. chronic
 pleural thickening.
