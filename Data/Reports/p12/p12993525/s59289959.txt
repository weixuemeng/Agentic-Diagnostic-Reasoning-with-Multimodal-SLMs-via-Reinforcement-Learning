                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Unexplained low sugar.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads
 terminating in the right atrium, ventricle and coronary sinus, respectively. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged to a similar degree.  A band-like opacity in
 the left mid lung suggests atelectasis in the lingula.  More generally,
 however, there is a diffuse new mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality most
 suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs seem mildly hyperinflated.  Small osteophytes are
 noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild interstitial pulmonary congestion.
