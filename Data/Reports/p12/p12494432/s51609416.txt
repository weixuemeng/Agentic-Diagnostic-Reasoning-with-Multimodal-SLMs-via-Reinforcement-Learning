                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been placement of a right chest tube at the base laterally.  However, since
 there has been no change in the large pleural effusion, the tube may be
 malpositioned.  A lateral view could prove helpful if the condition of the
 patient would permit.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
