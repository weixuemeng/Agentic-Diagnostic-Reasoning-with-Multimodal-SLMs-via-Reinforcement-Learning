                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower hemithorax,
 maybe due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded and is also of concern.  Minimal left
 base retrocardiac opacity may relate to atelectasis, although an additional
 site of infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No left pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 accurately assessed on the right due to the large right-sided opacity. 
 Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower hemithorax
 may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  Recommend followup to resolution.
 
 Minimal left base retrocardiac opacity may relate to atelectasis, although an
 additional site of infection or aspiration is not excluded.
