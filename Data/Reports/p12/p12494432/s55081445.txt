 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post pleural tap.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier the same date, at 17:08.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval slight decrease in right-sided mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity,
 status post pleural tap.  Large amount of opacity remain, which may be due to
 underlying pleural fluid, atelectasis, and/or consolidation.  Patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity persists.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
