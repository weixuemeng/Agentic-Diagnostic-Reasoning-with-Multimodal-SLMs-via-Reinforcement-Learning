                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a history of pneumonia complicated by
 loculated pleural effusion who has undergone VATS.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen a crescentic lucency above or in the region of the
 right hemidiaphragm which either represents stable pneumoperitoneum versus a
 locule of gas within the supradiaphragmatic pleural space.  There is no
 diaphragmatic flattening or mediastinal shift.  The right pleural effusion has
 improved since prior exam, now small, with areas of streaky atelectasis
 predominantly affecting the right middle lobe and right lung base. Improvement
 in the small left pleural effusion has also occurred, now trace in extent. 
 Streaky atelectasis at the left base is also present.  No apical pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable appearance of right lower chest crescentic lucency either
 representing pneumoperitoneum or a right basal pneumothorax without tension.
 
 2.  Improved bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
