                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right-sided VATS decortication,
 check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The patient's inspiration motion has
 improved in comparison with the previous study, and the supradiaphragmatic
 related pneumothorax cavity is filling in fluid and scar formations.  Linear
 parenchymal density just above the elevated diaphragmatic contour suggests
 remaining plate atelectasis, but there is no evidence of new pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.  This includes also the linear densities on the left
 lung base, also suggesting peripheral plate atelectasis or scar formations. 
 No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates and pneumothorax in the apical area
 can be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory postoperative chest findings.
