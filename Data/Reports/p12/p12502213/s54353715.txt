 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  In the right lung base
 medially, there is a vague opacity which abuts the diaphragm, non-specific,
 but in the appropriate clinical setting, could reflect pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the right lung base medially, adjacent to the
 diaphragm, which in the appropriate clinical setting may reflect pneumonia but
 is non-specific.
