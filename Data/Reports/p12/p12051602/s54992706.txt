                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Numerous outside hospital CT examinations dating from ___ through ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are mildly prominent.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 cavoatrial junction.  There are diffuse reticular pulmonary opacities which
 correspond to findings on prior chest CT.  There is a spiculated mass in the
 right lung field measuring approximately 3 cm corresponding to previous lesion
 seen on CT but appears to have enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary reticular parenchymal opacities as on prior CT
 with a probable increase in size of a spiculated mass in the right lung field.
