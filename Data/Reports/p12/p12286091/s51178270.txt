                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aortic knob is calcified.
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 noted. A moderate size right pleural effusion may be minimally increased in
 size compared to the prior exam. Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous
 changes again noted. Bibasilar patchy opacities are also more pronounced
 compared to the prior study, and could reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. Scarring within the
 lung apices is re- demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion, slightly increased compared to the prior
 study, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Emphysema. Patchy opacities in
 lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection is not completely
 excluded.
