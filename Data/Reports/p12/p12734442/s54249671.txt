 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Cardiac enlargement due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion is severe.
 Dependent pleural effusion on the right is moderate, and small left pleural
 abnormality either effusion or thickening is collected along the lateral chest

 redistribution, which is expected given the severe compromise in lung volume,
 but there is no pulmonary edema.
