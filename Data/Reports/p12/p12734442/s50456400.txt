                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old-male with history of mesothelioma, now presenting
 with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Overall aeration of the lungs appear
 similar compared to recent radiograph from ___, though with slightly
 increased non-specific opacification at the right base.  The chronic bibasilar
 opacities may be related to chronic atelectasis and pleural masses/fluid. 
 Slightly worsening at the right base could be due to progressive atelectasis,
 increased pleural fluid or superimposed infection/aspiration, worsening
 disease.  Attention on follow-up is recommended.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is no evidence of superimposed pulmonary edema.  Lung
 apices are clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic bibasilar opacities likely a combination of pleural
 thickening/fluid and atelectasis.  Slightly increased right basilar opacity is
 non-specific though could be due to increased atelectasis, effusion or
 superimposed infection.
