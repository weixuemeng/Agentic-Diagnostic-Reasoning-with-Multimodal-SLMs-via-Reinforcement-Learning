                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mesothelioma and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrates similar pleural
 abnormalities, left lateral pleural-based mass and right basilar pleural
 effusion.  Increased opacity at the right base may indicate a combination of
 atelectasis and consolidation.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Hilar fullness bilaterally may be indicative of superimposed pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable bibasilar pleural opacity representing mass/fluid and
 adjacent atelectasis.  Interval increase in hilar fullness suggestive of
 superimposed pulmonary edema.
