 Sternal wires are intact.  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass
 and mitral valve replacement.  Apparent asymmetric mild opacity of the right
 lung is likely due to patient rotation.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
