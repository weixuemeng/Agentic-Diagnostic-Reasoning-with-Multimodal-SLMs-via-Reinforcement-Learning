                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cellulitis, question
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right apical
 opacities are of indeterminate acuity given lack of priors for comparison;
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting, infection, including
 tuberculosis will not be excluded.  There is also right upper lobe perihilar
 scarring/atelectasis.  Scarring is seen to a lesser extent in the left upper
 lobe.  There is upward retraction of the right hilum.  There is also evidence
 of scarring/chronic changes in the right mid-to-lower lung with some tenting
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Evidence of a
 hiatal hernia is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy opacities in the right apex, with adjacent scarring, of
 indeterminate age given lack of priors for comparison. Could be chronic or
 acute. If acute, findings may be due to infection, in the appropriate clinical
 setting tuberculosis would not be excluded.
 
 2.  Hiatal hernia.
