 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and

 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a retrocardiac
 opacity containing gas most compatible with hiatal hernia.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony
 structures notable for an acute left humeral neck fracture and dextroscoliosis
 of the T-spine.

 Left humeral neck fracture better assessed on dedicated left shoulder
 radiographs.  Hiatal hernia.  No acute intrathoracic process.
