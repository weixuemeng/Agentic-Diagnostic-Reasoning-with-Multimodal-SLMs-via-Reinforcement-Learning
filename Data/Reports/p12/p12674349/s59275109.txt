                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A right
 PICC is again seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle suggesting a trace pleural effusion.  A trace right pleural effusion
 would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
