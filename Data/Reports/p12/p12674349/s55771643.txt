                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rising white count, to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. 
 This most likely represents pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. 
 However, the possibility of a focus of consolidation just above this cannot be
 excluded.  Less prominent changes are seen on the left.  Central catheter
 remains in place.
