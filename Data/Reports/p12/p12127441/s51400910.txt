                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is engorged peripherally, hilar arteries are dilated,
 but there is no pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is substantially due
 to left atrial enlargement.  Mediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.  Pulmonary vascular congestion, probable pulmonary
 hypertension, and severe left atrial enlargement point to mitral valve
 pathology.
