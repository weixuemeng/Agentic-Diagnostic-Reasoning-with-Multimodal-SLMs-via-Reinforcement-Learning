 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Central line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An increased
 interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary vascular congestion including
 Kerley B lines, upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity, and
 bilateral perihilar fullness.  In addition, however, there is increasing
 confluent right perihilar opacification which is asymmetric and may indicate a
 superimposed additional process such as pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening interstitial abnormality suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  More confluent right perihilar opacity.  Although an
 asymmetric pattern of pulmonary congestion could be considered particularly
 given rapid onset in the same timeframe, coinciding pneumonia should also be
 considered.
 
 2.  Satisfactory placement of central venous catheter.
