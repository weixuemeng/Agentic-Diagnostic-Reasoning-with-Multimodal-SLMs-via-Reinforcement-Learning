                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP Portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval resolution of previously seen pleural effusions, given that a lateral
 view was not obtained.  Subtle patchy left base opacity most likely relates to
 atelectasis or vascular structures, although an early/mild consolidation in
 the appropriate clinical setting is difficult to exclude.  The right lung is
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy left base opacity most likely relates to
 atelectasis or vascular structures, although in the appropriate clinical
 setting, early consolidation is difficult to exclude.
