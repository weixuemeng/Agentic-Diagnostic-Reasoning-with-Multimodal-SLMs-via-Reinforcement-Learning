                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lung cancer, now with new fever, clinical
 concern for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast, ___ and chest radiograph,
 ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is interval improvement in the
 previously seen patchy right lower lobe opacities.  A nipple shadow projects
 of the left mid lung and seems to overlap with a faint opacity probably
 corresponding to a ground glass opacity in the left lung also depicted on the
 prior CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  A right upper
 extremity PICC ends in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable, except for mild aortic calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities, probably pneumonia, but improved.
