                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever, confusion, history of lung
 cancer.  Questionable infiltrate on portable chest examination, assess for
 developing infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is
 mildly widened and elongated and shows calcium deposits in the wall mostly at
 the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Irregular
 peripheral vascular distribution in the lungs coinciding with relatively low
 positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms is consistent with COPD.  Acute
 new discrete parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  The next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___ subtle patchy densities in the left
 base cannot be identified to the same degree as before and thus have not
 developed into an acute infiltrate in this patient with chronic COPD.  When
 comparison is extended to a more remote PA and lateral chest examination of
 ___ it can be noted that the patient at that time had bilateral
 pleural effusions which now have resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new acute infiltrates, evidence of chronic COPD.
