                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post extubation with coarse lung
 sounds and cough.  Assess for pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 10:17.
 
 Portable AP chest film dated ___ at 6:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given the patient
 rotation on the current examination.  The lungs appear well inflated without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or aspiration. 
 There is a small layering right effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 slightly less well defined and likely reflects interval development of mild
 interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax.
