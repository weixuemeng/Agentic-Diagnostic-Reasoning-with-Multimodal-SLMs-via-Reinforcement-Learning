                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax following transbronchial biopsy on the
 left and lavage on the right.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates diffuse bilateral
 opacities, likely reflective of the bilateral lavage and edema from the
 biopsy.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute procedure related complication.
 2.  Bilateral lower lung airspace opacities likely reflective of lavage.
