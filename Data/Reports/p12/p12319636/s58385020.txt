                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 With R mid back pain, radiating to front, worse w/ inspiration, evaluate for
 acute process..
 
 COMPARISON:  None Available.
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate cardiac silhouette, limiting accurate assessment
 of overall size.  Aorta is mildly tortuous and slightly prominent for a
 patient of this age.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  Prominent thoracic aorta for a patient of this age,
 possibly extension weighted by expiratory phase of respiration.  However, if
 clinical symptomatology suggests the possibility of aortic dissection, CTA of
 the chest would be recommended.
