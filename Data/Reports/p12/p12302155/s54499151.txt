                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with interstitial lung disease and shortness of
 breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph in ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, and the pulmonary vasculature is normal. Chronic interstitial
 opacities in a peripheral and basilar predominant pattern are re-
 demonstrated, more pronounced in the left lung, and compatible with known
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is evident. There is diffuse gaseous distention of
 the bowel loops with chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change in chronic interstitial lung disease without
 acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
