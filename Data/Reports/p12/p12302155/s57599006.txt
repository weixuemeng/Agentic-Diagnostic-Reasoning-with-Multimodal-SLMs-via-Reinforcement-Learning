                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of interstitial lung
 disease, any worrisome lesion?
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  The cardiac configuration  suggests a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly, a
 finding which in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta indicates the possibility of systemic hypertension.  There is,
 however, no significant left atrial enlargement and the pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  There is no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates;
 however, on the lung bases, an increased interstitial pattern in the form of
 linear densities is noted, more marked on the left than on the right.  There
 exist also some mild thickenings of the pleural spaces along the lateral chest
 walls, but no evidence exists of free pleural effusion accumulating in the
 lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  Moderately distended and gas-filled
 large bowel loops are seen in the upper portion of the abdomen.  Such bowel
 loops are overlying the liver shadow on the right side.  Comparison can be
 made with a referred chest examination from ___ dated ___.  At that
 time, a large right-sided colon loop interposed between the elevated
 right-sided diaphragm and the liver shadow representing a so-called
 eventeratio.  This condition apparently has reverted spontaneously.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Absence of cardiac enlargement or pulmonary congestion, no acute
 infiltrates, basal lung findings compatible with chronic pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Apparently, the latter diagnosis was already established on transferred chest
 CTs from ___, also briefly reviewed at the time of this interpretation.
