                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, decreased breath sounds on right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided dialysis catheter is again seen extending into the right atrium. 
 There are moderate to large right and moderate left pleural effusions, new
 since the prior study, with overlying atelectasis.  Basilar consolidation is
 difficult to exclude.  There is also mild pulmonary edema.  The patient is
 rotated to the right.  Due to the bibasilar opacities, accurate assessment of
 the cardiac silhouette is difficult but it may be mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 is calcified.  The bones are osteopenic with vertebral body heights in the
 thoracic spine grossly maintained on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions and mild pulmonary
 edema, underlying consolidation due to infection difficult to exclude.
