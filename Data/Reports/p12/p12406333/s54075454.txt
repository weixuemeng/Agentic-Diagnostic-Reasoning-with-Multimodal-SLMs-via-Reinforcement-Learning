                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, hypoxia and crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding and
 calcification along the arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Patchy medial
 basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis in association with low lung
 volumes.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate rightward focal convex curvature is
 centered along the upper lumbar spine, but not well visualized with suspected
 associated degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute disease aside from patchy basilar opacities
 suggestive of minor atelectasis.
