                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity edema and generalized weakness.  Evaluate for
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis and scarring.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Aortic knob calcifications
 are re-demonstrated.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Unfolding of the descending thoracic aorta is
 re-demonstrated.  Irregularity of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour is not
 significantly changed.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is again noted.  There are also multilevel degenerative
 changes of the visualized portion of the spine, as before.  A previously seen
 lumbar compression fracture on radiographs from ___ is not well
 visualized on the present study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
