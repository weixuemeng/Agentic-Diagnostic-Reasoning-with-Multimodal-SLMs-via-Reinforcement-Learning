                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man intravenous drug user with fever.  Evaluate for
 possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Vague areas of focal ground-glass opacification in both lungs are difficult to
 define on prior bedside chest radiograph, perhaps because of technical
 limitations.  The most discrete abnormalities project over the left fourth
 anterior rib and right second through fourth anterior interspaces laterally. 
 There is no cavitation or frank consolidation.  There is a suggestion of mild
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality with septal lines at the right lung base
 laterally and mild bronchial cuffing.  Hila are not enlarged, but the right
 paratracheal stripe is partially obliterated, raising question of central
 lymph node enlargement.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Lateral view shows small bilateral pleural effusion and thickening of the
 posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius which may be due to either edema or
 lymph node enlargement.
 
 There is no way to know given the patient's history of intravenous drug use,
 whether the interstitial abnormality, even though it is mild, is acute or
 chronic.  The multifocal vague lung lesions could be due to atypical
 infection, particularly virus.
 
 A ___-mm wide nodular opacity projects over the right sixth anterior interspace
 could be a nipple shadow or lung nodule.  There is a suggestion of another
 similar size lung nodule projecting through the liver at the level of the same
 interspace more anteromedially.  If patient's clinical condition does not
 improve, CT scanning would be important for documenting the type and extent of
 abnormality.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 3:45 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
