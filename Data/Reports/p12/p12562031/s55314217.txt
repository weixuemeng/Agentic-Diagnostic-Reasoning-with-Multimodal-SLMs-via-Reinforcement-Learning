                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 This report was transposed with the exam immediately prior.  The correct
 report is below:
 
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  17:30 today.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable chest radiograph demonstrates near complete resolution of
 the left pneumothorax.  Minimal pleural air may be present at the left apex. 
 The left pigtail catheter is now coiled appropriately.  Small volume
 pneumomediastinum is still apparent.  There is no effusion or consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near complete resolution of large left pneumothorax.  Pigtail catheter coiled
 appropriately in the left pleural space.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs earlier today. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  A left-sided chest
 tube has been inserted into the left lateral 6th rib interspace.  The pigtail
 is not coiled.  The left pneumothorax remains large.  Rightward mediastinal
 shift is unchanged.  Small pneumomediastinum is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable size of large left pneumothorax despite chest tube placement.  A
 subsequently obtained chest radiograph demonstrates resolution of the
 pneumothorax.
