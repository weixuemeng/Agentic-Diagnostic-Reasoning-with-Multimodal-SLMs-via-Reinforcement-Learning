                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 This report was transposed with the exam immediately subsequent.  The correct
 report is below:
 
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs earlier today. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  A left-sided chest
 tube has been inserted into the left lateral 6th rib interspace.  The pigtail
 is not coiled.  The left pneumothorax remains large.  Rightward mediastinal
 shift is unchanged.  Small pneumomediastinum is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable size of large left pneumothorax despite chest tube placement.  A
 subsequently obtained chest radiograph demonstrates near resolution of the
 pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  17:30 today.

 consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Complete resolution of large left pneumothorax.  Pigtail catheter coiled
 appropriately in the left pleural space.
