                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant patient with hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  There are
 bilateral airspace opacities throughout the mid and lower left lung and medial
 lower right lung most likely reflecting pulmonary edama, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  The cardiac or mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities most likely represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 Multifocal infection cannot be excluded.
