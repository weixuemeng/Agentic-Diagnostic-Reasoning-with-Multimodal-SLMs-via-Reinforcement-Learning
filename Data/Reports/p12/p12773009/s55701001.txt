                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with CLL and hypoxia and reported history of
 pleural effusion.  Assess for infiltrate or effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest was obtained.  Small-to-moderate
 right and likely small left pleural effusion. Accompanying bibasilar
 opacities, most compatible with atelectasis, though in the appropriate
 setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  The left
 costophrenic angle is somewhat excluded from view.  The upper lungs are well
 aerated.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 14:20 on
 ___.
