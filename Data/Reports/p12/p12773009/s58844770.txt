 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in
 appearance since the prior study, with a known lymphadenopathy consistent with
 history of CLL.  Right pleural effusion has decreased in size with only a
 minimal residual effusion remaining.  Lungs are grossly clear except for a
 small calcified granuloma in the left mid lung, corresponding to the lingula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Near resolution of right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy consistent with history of CLL.
