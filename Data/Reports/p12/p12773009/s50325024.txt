                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath and sputum production.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously noted consolidation in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe
 has improved when compared to the prior study, with residual opacity noted,
 compatible with improving pneumonia.  Heart size is difficult to assess given
 the presence of a moderate left and small right bilateral pleural effusions. 
 The effusion on the left has increased in size while the effusion on the right
 appears relatively unchanged.  There is associated bibasilar atelectasis.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.  New ill-defined opacification within the
 left apex may reflect a new area of infection.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen and there is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Residual opacity in the left anterior segment of the left upper lobe is
 compatible with improving pneumonia.
 
 2.  New ill -defined opacification within the left lung apex may reflect a new
 site of infection.
 
 3.  Slight increase in size of the moderate sized left pleural effusion, and
 slight interval decrease in size of small right pleural effusion compared to
 the prior radiograph.  There is associated bibasilar atelectasis.
