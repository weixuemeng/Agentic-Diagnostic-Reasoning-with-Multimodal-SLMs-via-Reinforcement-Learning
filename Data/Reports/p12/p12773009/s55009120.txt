                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CLL, new left upper lobe evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___, and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The large left upper lobe rounded opacity with a diameter of
 approximately 5 cm that was documented on the CT examination from ___, measures 7 cm in diameter on the current radiograph.  The lesion, thus,
 has increased in size.  The appearance of the lesion on CT is strongly
 suggestive of a fungal inflammatory process.
 
 Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  
 
 No other or newly occurred parenchymal opacities.  No pulmonary edema.
