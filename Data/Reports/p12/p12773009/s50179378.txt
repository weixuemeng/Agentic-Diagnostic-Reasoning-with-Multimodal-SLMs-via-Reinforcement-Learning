 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Dyspnea, cough and CHF.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 Allowing for the difference in positioning of the patient, moderate right and
 small left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis has improved.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally
 improved.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.
