                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.  Pre-thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Somewhat ill-defined area of increased
 opacification in the left apical region again may reflect developing
 pneumonia.
