                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 846 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of recent pneumonia, assess for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 846 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval resolution of the left apical consolidation, but
 there is now a left hilar and suprahilar area of consolidation, which most
 likely represents an infectious process given that it is less mass like on the
 lateral projection than on the frontal view.  Consideration should also
 include post-obstructive pneumonia in this patient with known CLL and
 extensive lymphadenopathy on a chest, abdomen, pelvis CT performed on
 ___.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Bilateral layering pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, are seen.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema. Heart remains stably enlarged.  Several small nodular
 opacities in the periphery of the left mid and lower lung measuring up to 4-5
 mm in size likely correspond to two of the CT identified multiple calcified
 and non-calcified pulmonary nodules for which followup imaging was advised on
 the CT report dated ___.
