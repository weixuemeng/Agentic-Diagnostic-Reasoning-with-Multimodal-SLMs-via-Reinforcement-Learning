                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma
 with endobronchial involvement.  The patient is status post stent placement in
 bronchus intermedius in ___.  The patient now presents with several episodes
 of hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, ___, and CT chest
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating
 in the left main stem bronchus.  The NG tube is positioned in the stomach. 
 There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is apparent
 volume loss involving right hemithorax with associted rightward shift of
 midline structures.  Right perihilar opacities are again noted, related to
 patient's known history of endobronchial metastatic disease.  Right upper lobe
 opacity, likely represents atelectasis due to underventilation.  Left lung is
 clear, without convincing pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube is positioned within the left main stem bronchus.  The
 right upper lobe opacity is largely due volume loss secondary to
 under-ventilation.
 
 2.  Persistent right perihilar opacity, consistent with patient's known
 history of endobronchial metastatic disease.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:45 a.m., ___ by phone.
