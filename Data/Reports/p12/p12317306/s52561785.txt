                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  History of renal cell carcinoma with pulmonary
 metastases.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ are available, but a
 more recent chest CT is available from ___, earlier on the same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged including
 moderate tortuosity of the aorta.  The heart is probably normal in size. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with substantial opacity involving the
 right hilum and nearby cardiophrenic sulcus appear similar compared to the
 recent prior examination.  Regarding the lung parenchyma, no definite nodules
 are demonstrated radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar medial right basilar opacity which is nonspecific but
 shows air bronchograms, perhaps associated with radiation fibrosis in the
 appropriate setting, although coinciding malignant mass in the area is not
 excluded.
