                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pacemaker for MRI.  // Patient has a
 pacemaker.  Please evaluate leads for MRI.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures at the lung bases likely
 contributes to slightly increased opacification at both lateral lung bases.
 The lungs are grossly clear. A left pectoral pacemaker sends leads to the
 right atrium and right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly
 and a small hiatal hernia are present.  The bones are osteopenic. A partially
 imaged sclerotic lesion at the right humeral head is likely an enchondroma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Pacemaker sends leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 Low lung volumes limits assessment of the lung bases. Repeat PA radiograph
 with improved inspiratory level is recommended when the patient's condition
 permits
 
 Small hiatal hernia.
 
 Right humeral enchondroma.
