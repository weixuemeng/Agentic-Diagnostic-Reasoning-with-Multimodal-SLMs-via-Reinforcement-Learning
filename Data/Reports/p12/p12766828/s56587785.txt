 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:04 PM
  ETT appears to terminate about 1.5 cm above the carina.  NGT passes off image
  but appears to coil in the stomach.  Patient body habitus, portable technique,
  rotation of patient, and low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding limit
  evaluation for edema, but no definite edema is seen.  Bibasliar opacities are
  seen, left greater that right, which likely reflect atelectasis in this
  post-surgical patient, but cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right
  clinical setting.
