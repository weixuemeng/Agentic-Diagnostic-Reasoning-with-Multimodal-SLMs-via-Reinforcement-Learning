                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Trauma, L1 compression fracture, and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  Surgical
 chains project in the right upper lung.  If any there is a small right
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no displaced rib fractures. 
 This is not a study dedicated to evaluate rib abnormality, and if necessary,
 dedicated rib series or cross sectional study could be performed.
