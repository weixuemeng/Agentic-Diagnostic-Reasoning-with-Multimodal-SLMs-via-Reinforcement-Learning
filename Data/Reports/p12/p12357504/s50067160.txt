                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal "pneumonia" at OSH, Rxd with abx
 and steroids  // assess for improvement c/w ___ OSH CXR to be uploaded to
 PACS.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well expanded.  Extensive calcified and noncalcified
 pleural plaques are unchanged from prior exam and are suggestive of prior
 asbestos exposure. There is an unchanged opacity in the right lung base, which
 may represent scarring related to the pleural plaques or possibly interstitial
 disease.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No new opacity to suggest pneumonia. Comparison with OSH radiographs
 demonstrating pneumonia could be helpful for further assessment.
 
 2.  Unchanged extensive calcified and noncalcified pleural plaques, suggestive
 of prior asbestos exposure.
 
 3.  Unchanged opacity in the periphery of the right lung base, which may
 represent localized scarring related to adjacent pleural plaques or possibly
 related to asbestosis/interstitial disease.
