                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of chronic severe bronchiolitis,
 with recent exacerbation and now presenting with productive cough and
 subjective fevers.  The patient has a history of pseudomonal pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of radiographs of the chest dating back to ___, most recently from ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest once again demonstrate a
 diffuse pattern of heterogeneous opacity in the bilateral lower lobes and
 right middle lobe surrounding thin-walled radiolucent structures consistent
 with the patient's history of chronic severe bronchiolitis.  When compared to
 the most recent study from ___, there is equivocal increased
 opacities in the right middle lobe.  The upper lung fields are clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal increase in right middle lobe opacity may suggest an
 early infectious process superimposed on severe chronic bronchiectasis.
