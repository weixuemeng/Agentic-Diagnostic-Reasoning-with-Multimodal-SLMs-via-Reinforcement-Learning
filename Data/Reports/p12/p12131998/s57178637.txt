 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  There
 is apparent widening of the mediastinum, though much of this could merely
 reflect the supine rather than erect position in a patient with mediastinal
 lipomatosis.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no
 definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
