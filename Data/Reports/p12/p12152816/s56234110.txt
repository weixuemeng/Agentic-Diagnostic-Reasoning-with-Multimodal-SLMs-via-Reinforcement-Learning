                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with syncopal episode and cardiomyopathy. 
 Evaluate for pleural effusion and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ Cardiac MR.
 
 ___:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left, both decreased in size since the MR from seven days ago.  There are also
 patchy opacities at the lung bases, consistent with atelectasis.  Pneumonia
 cannot be rule out in the correct clinical setting. No pulmonary edema is
 present. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. An oblong opacity
 projecting over the sixth anterior rib on the right measuring ___ x 16 mm may
 be osseous based or may be within the lung.  Degenerative changes are seen at
 the right AC joint; otherwise, the bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, both decreased
 in size since the cardiac MR from seven days prior.
 2.  Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities at the lung bases, consistent with
 atelectasis.
 3.  ___ x 16 mm opacity projecting over the right sixth anterior rib. 
 Recommend shallow oblique views to delineate the location of this opacity.
