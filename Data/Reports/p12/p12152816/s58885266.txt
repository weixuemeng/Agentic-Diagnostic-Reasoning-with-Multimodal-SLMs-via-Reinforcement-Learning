                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cardiac amyloid and pleural
 effusion, evaluate size of pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  Cardiac enlargement as before.  Unchanged
 appearance of thoracic aorta, thus only mildly widened and elongated without
 evidence of local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature shows a
 mild upper zone redistribution pattern and some perivascular haze on the
 bases.  On previous examination identified pleural effusion obliterating the
 right lateral pleural sinus has increased slightly.  There are some crowded
 pulmonary vessels on the right base, but no conclusive evidence for
 infiltrates is present.  The left-sided retrocardiac pulmonary density
 persists and as before, is indicative of a sizeable atelectasis in the left
 lower lobe.  The lateral view discloses that also some small amount of pleural
 effusion reaches into the posterior left-sided pleural space.  Previously
 identified calcification in right-sided sixth anterior rib remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increasing and suggestive
 of CHF.  Left-sided retrocardiac atelectasis persists and possibility of
 infective course is likely.  No other interval changes are seen.
