                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain radiating to the back.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm is present.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal
 bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal biapical scarring is visualized.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine which are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  No evidence of
 mediastinal widening.
