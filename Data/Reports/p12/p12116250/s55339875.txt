                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after biventricular
 placement of the pacemaker.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The appearance of the biventricular leads is unremarkable.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or abnormal
 position of the pacemaker leads.
 
 There is no pleural effusion.  There is minimal opacity in the right lower
 lobe that most likely reflects atelectasis, but attention to patient's
 symptoms is recommended to exclude the possibility of developing pneumonia.
