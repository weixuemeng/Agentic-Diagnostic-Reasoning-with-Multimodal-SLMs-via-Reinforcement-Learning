                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Patchy
 opacities are present at both lung bases, with otherwise clear lungs.  There
 are no pleural effusions.  Possible bronchial wall thickening is noted,
 particularly in the perihilar and infrahilar regions on the lateral
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly due to
 aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia given clinical concern for this
 entity.  Apparent co-existing bronchial wall thickening could be due to
 aspirated secretions or a potentially more chronic airways disease.  Followup
 radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
