                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mental status change, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued
 bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right, in a patient with
 dual-channel pacer device with appropriately positioned leads.  Enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette persists.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous pressure.
