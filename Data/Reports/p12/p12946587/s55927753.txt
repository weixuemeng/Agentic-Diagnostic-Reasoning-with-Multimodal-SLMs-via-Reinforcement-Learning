                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypertension and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There
 are mildly prominent suprahilar opacities which suggest mildly engorged
 pulmonary vascularity but little if at all changed since the earlier
 comparison study, suggesting mild pulmonary venous hypertension without focal
 opacities to suggest pneumonia.  Frank pulmonary edema has resolved since the
 more recent prior examination.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is similar to the
 prior examinations, most suggestive of persistent minor atelectasis or
 scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
