                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest/epigastric pain and a wet cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is left base
 atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral
 view is not well substantiated on the frontal view, underlying consolidation
 due to infection cannot be entirely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lobe opacity projecting over the lower spine on the lateral
 view, not well substantiated on the frontal view, may represent atelectasis vs
 consolidation.
