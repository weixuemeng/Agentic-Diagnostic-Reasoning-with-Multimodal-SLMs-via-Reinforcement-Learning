                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of large left pleural effusion,
 recently status post left thoracoscopy.  Assess position of tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___, and CTA torso from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  After thoracoscopy, there has been
 significant interval decrease in the size of a large left pleural effusion. 
 Mild amount of fluid persists within the left costophrenic angle and a linear
 opacity within the left mid lung likely reflects plate-like atelectasis. 
 There is a small apical pneumothorax.  There is also left basilar atelectasis.
 Unfolding and tortuosity of the aorta seen on prior radiographs appears
 similar.  Cardiac margins are obscured by basilar opacity.  Left chest tube
 terminates in the medial left upper lung adjacent to the aortic knob on the
 frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval thoracoscopy with decreased left pleural fluid. 
 Persistent left basilar atelectasis and a small amount of residual pleural
 fluid.  Left chest tube in appropriate position.  Tiny left apical
 pneumothorax.
