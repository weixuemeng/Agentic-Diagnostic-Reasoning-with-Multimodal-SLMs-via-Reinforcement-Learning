                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 23:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with non-small cell lung CA and known
 effusion with tachypnea and intermittent hypoxia, question progression.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:06.
 
 AP portable upright chest film ___ at 23:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  The appearance
 of the left hemithorax is unchanged, with more focal areas of pleural opacity
 both laterally and medially as well as at the left apex.  There is a more
 focal consolidation in the left lower lung.  Findings are consistent with
 known metastatic disease.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen in the
 right lung.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due
 to the diffuse abnormality in the left hemithorax.  No pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
