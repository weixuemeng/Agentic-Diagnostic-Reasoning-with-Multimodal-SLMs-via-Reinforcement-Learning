                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided weakness metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph 3 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall appearance is similar to the prior examination with pleural thickening
 in the left lower lung field along with increased density and reticulation in
 the left lung base as well as similar moderate size left pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to obscuration from surrounding
 consolidation.  The left hilar contour is again prominent.  The right lung
 remains essentially clear except for linear scarring in the base.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall similar appearance to the prior examination with pleural thickening,
 left basilar opacification and left hilar fullness from known metastatic
 adenocarcinoma.  Again increased density and reticulation in the left lung
 base could represent either pneumonia, lymphangitic tumor spread or
 atelectasis.
