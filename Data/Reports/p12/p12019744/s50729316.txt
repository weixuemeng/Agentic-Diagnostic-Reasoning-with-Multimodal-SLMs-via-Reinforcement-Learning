 In comparison to ___ radiograph, support and monitoring devices are
 similar in position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Persistent
 pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild edema.  A more confluent
 opacity in the left lung base has worsened, and raises the concern for
 developing infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions appear slightly increased but positional
 differences limit comparison to the previous study.
