                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a pigtail catheter at the left base.  There has been some
 decrease in the degree of left effusion and atelectasis.  There are two kinks
 in the catheter, which could be adversely affecting its function.
 
 
 Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with effusion and
 atelectasis.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
