                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/pulmonary edema, now s/p intubation.  // Is the
 ETT in the correct location?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 day earlier, there has been
 interval placement of an endotracheal tube which terminates 3.9 cm above the
 carina.  A transesophageal catheter extends to at least the body of the
 stomach, although the tip is not visualized.  There is at least moderate
 gaseous distension of the stomach.
 
 Pulmonary edema is mild, although worse from the prior study performed earlier
 on the same date.  Dense left retrocardiac opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis.  No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cervical spine
 fusion hardware is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of the new endotracheal tube, approximately 3.9 cm
 above the carina.
 2. Slightly worsening pulmonary edema.
