                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea and right upper quadrant pain, please eval for
 effusion, other pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Mild cardiac silhouette
 enlargement is unchanged.  A small hiatal hernia is also re- demonstrated. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Low lung volumes results in mild
 crowding of bronchovascular structures and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  A metallic biliary
 stent is seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.
