 HISTORY:  Weakness and hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.

 mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is again mild-to-moderately tortuous.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A dense opacity in the posterior lower
 lobes on the lateral view is probably in the right lower lobe, suggesting
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense opacity in the posterior right lower lobe suggesting
 pneumonia.
