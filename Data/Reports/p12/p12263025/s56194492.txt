 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given mild rotation of the patient to the right, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely not significantly changed compared to
 ___.  There is mild cardiomegaly, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
 Right hilus is non-evaluable.  Left hilus is unremarkable.  There is mild

 lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Severe
 degenerative changes are noted in the right glenohumeral joint.
