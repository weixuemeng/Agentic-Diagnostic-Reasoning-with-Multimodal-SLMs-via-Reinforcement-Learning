                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung
 volumes are low and the patient is rotated to her right, which limits the
 evaluation.  Linear densities in the left and right lower lungs likely
 represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no convincing evidence
 of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size
 appears relatively stable, and the mediastinal contour is difficult to assess
 given rotation to the right.  Degenerative changes are again noted at
 bilateral shoulders.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  No large
 effusions are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study with lower lung subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Otherwise grossly unremarkable.
