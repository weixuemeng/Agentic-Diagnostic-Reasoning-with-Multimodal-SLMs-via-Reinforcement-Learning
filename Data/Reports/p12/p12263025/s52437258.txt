 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD now with hypoxia.  Evidence of

 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph

 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior, the lung volumes have decreased, accentuating the heart
 size and interstitial markings.  Mild perihilar opacities and more conspicuous
 upper pulmonary vasculature may indicate mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is likely, right worse than left.  Small right pleural effusion is
 also likely.  The heart is enlarged.

 1. Bibasilar atelectasis, right worse than left with small right pleural
