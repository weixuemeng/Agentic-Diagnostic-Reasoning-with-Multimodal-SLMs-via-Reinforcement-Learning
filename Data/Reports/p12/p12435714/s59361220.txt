  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Slight asymmetric increased opacification
  of the left lower lung field could be due to asymmetric edema however in the
  correct clinical setting and infection cannot be excluded.  Results discussed
  over the telephone with ___ at 17:30 on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread bilateral alveolar opacities with a central predominance
 are new compared to the prior chest x-ray, and are accompanied by scattered
 septal lines in the lung periphery.  Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured
 by the alveolar opacities but is likely slightly increased in size compared to
 the prior radiograph even allowing for differences in technical factors
 between the exams.  Azygous vein is slightly distended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread bilateral alveolar opacities and septal thickening,
 most likely due to pulmonary edema.  Correlative cardiac echo may be helpful
 to assess for a potential cardiac etiology given the patient's history of
 recent C-section. Amniotic fluid embolism, massive aspiration and widespread
 pulmonary infection are additional diagnostic considerations for the diffuse
 pulmonary opacities.
