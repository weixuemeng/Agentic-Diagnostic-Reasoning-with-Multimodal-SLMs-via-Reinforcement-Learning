                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:15 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Severe cerebral palsy and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. 
 Successful GJ tube placement.  Fever for 24 hours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 3:20 a.m.:
 
 If clinical assessment is inconsistent with the previously suggested diagnosis
 of pulmonary edema and concurrent pneumonia, then the interval progression of
 left lower lobe opacification could worsening of pneumonia, previously more
 severe on the right.  Because of the global nature of the findings, it is
 possible that the pneumonia is caused by condition other than aspiration,
 including atypical pneumonia due to virus or mycoplasma, or could be a drug or
 transfusion reaction.  I suggest reconsidering concurrent pulmonary edema as
 well
