                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right pleuritic chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. There is diffuse interstitial opacity throughout
 the lungs bilaterally, better evaluated on the recent CT. There is diffuse
 pleural thickening bilaterally.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is
 identified.  Severe central adenopathy is better appreciated on the concurrent
 chest CT scan, reported separately. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, diffuse interstitial opacities and
 pleural thickening better evaluated on the CT chest from the same day and
 consistent with malignancy with metastatic malignancy or, alternatively,
 concurrent malignancy and another cause of symmetric central adenopathy and
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality, such as sarcoidosis.
