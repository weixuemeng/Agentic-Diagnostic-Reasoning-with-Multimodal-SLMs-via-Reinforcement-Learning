                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of a right-sided Port-A-Cath, terminating in the
 distal SVC.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the
 aorta calcified and tortuous and the cardiac silhouette not enlarged.  There
 are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 Medial right infrahilar opacity is felt to be due to vascular structures. 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
