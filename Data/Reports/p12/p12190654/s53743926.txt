 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and worsening ascites.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is of normal size.  The aorta is tortuous and there is
 calcification of the aortic knob.  Small linear opacity in the right lung base
 is compatible with atelectasis and/or chronic interstitial changes.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without focal or diffuse abnormality.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign
 body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right lung base linear opacity, compatible with atelectasis
 and/or chronic interstitial changes.  No pleural effusion or focal
 consolidation.
