                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary sarcoid, thryoid cancer s/p
 thyroidectomy presenting s/p cardiac arrest  // Evaluate for acute pulm
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 19:09
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Bilateral hilar and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is unchanged. There is mild right upper lobe opacity that
 might potentially represent sequela of resuscitation but on the other hand
 developing right upper lobe pneumonia or asymmetric edema (less likely) is
 suspected. No definitive evidence of lung involvement by thyroid cancer is
 demonstrated but this imaging modality is by far sub optimal for that
 assessment.
