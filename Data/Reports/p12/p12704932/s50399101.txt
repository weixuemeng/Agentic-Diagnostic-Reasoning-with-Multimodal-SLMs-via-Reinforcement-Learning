 eval for evidence of PNA, mediastinal LAD
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no comparison available.
 The mid and lower lung zones show an asymmetry in radiodensity, potentially
 related to asymmetrical or right postsurgical breast tissue.  On the other
 hand, there is a minimal increase in radiodensity over the right mid and lower
 lung zones, apparent on both the frontal and the lateral view.  Overall, the
 findings would be consistent with developing pneumonia, but the repeat
 radiograph, with attention to symmetrical breast positioning, should be
 obtained within the next ___hr.  , to confirm this suspicion.
 Normal size of the heart.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
