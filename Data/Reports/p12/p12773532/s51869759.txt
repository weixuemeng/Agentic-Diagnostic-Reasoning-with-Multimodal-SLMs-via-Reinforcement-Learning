 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with epilepsy with opacification of the right
 lung apex seen on recent CT of the cervical spine.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate bilateral apical
 pleural thickening, greater on the right, with no focal consolidation or
 nodule seen.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical pleural thickening with no definite mass seen.  If
 there is continued clinical concern, a dedicated CT of the chest should be
 performed for further evaluation.
