                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  There are no acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings to account for cough.  If there is strong clinical
 suspicion for a radiographically occult cause such as interstitial or airways
 disease, then high-resolution chest CT may be considered.
