                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has increased from prior.  There are persistent low
 lung volumes.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is stable.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis, larger in the left lower lobe, associated with small bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  New opacity in the left mid hemithorax is
 likely due to pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Attention should be paid in followup studies.
