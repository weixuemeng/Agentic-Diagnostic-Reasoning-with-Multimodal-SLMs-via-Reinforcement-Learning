                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status after fall*** WARNING ***
 Multiple patients with same last name!  // r/o ICH, fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest and abdomen from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  Curvilinear density in the left
 upper quadrant is seen.  There is mild scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
