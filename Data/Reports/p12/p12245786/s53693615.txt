  Opacity projecting over right posterior 5th rib may represent a sclerotic rib
  lesion or, less likely, intraparenchymal lesion. Otherwise, unchanged
  appearance of chest with cardiomegaly and dilated, tortuous thoracic aorta.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure, now with chest pain, here to
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically expanded without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is congested.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but
 stable.  Prominence of the left main pulmonary artery is unchanged.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous and dilated, similar in appearance to the prior
 study.  Wedge compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged. An opacity projecting over the right posterior 5th rib may
 represent a sclerotic rib lesion or, less likely, intraparenchymal lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Dilated and tortous thoracic aorta.  Acute aortic dissection is not
 excluded on the basis of this study.
