                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement is unchanged.  The aortic knob remains calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal, and the pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  While there is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 posteriorly which could suggest a tiny pleural effusion, no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  There is no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  A compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible tiny right pleural effusion.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
