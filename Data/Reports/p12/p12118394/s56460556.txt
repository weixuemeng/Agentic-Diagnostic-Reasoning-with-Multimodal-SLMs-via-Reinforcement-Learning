                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Evaluation is quite limited given the low lung volumes.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema evidenced by diffuse ground-glass pulmonary opacities.  There
 is no large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly stable though low lung volumes significantly limit evaluation.  Imaged
 osseous structures appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse ground-glass pulmonary opacities most likely reflecting
 pulmonary edema.  Recommend post-diuresis films to exclude underlying
 pneumonia.
