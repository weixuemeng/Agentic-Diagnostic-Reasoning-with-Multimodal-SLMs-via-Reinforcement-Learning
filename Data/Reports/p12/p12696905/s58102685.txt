                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fatigue, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is kyphotic which slightly limits assessment.  Heart size appears mild
 to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  Low lung volumes results in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas atelectasis without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
