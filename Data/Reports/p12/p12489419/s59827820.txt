 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hyponatremia and cirrhosis.
 
 CHEST, AP:  Heart appears enlarged with left ventricular prominence.  The lung
 fields are clear.  There is no evidence of failure.  Widening of the right
 paratracheal region is thought to represent a somewhat tortuous innominate
 artery.  This could be compared with previous chest x-ray or reports.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest clear.  No edema.  No effusions.
