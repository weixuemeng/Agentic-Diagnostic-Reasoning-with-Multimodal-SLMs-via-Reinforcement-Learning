                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, but similar compared
 to the previous exam.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
