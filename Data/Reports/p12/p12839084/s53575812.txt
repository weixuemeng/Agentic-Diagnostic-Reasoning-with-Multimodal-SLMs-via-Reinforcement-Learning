 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  No priors
 available for comparison.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild blunting of the right CP angle
 suggesting a small effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The
 imaged bony structures are intact.  There is no free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable tiny right pleural effusion.  Otherwise normal.
