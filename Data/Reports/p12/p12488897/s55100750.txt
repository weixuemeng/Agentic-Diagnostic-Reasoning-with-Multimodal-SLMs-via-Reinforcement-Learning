                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, now intubated,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 22:54.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  Lung volumes remain markedly low with increasing opacity at
 the left base and a stable patchy opacity at the right base.  There are likely
 layering effusions, left greater than right.  The findings most likely reflect
 bibasilar patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Vascular crowding is seen, likely related to low lung volumes with no overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the markedly low lung
 volumes.
