                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal in appearance.  Lungs are
 clear except for a tiny calcified granuloma in the periphery of the right
 lower lobe.  No rib fractures are identified, but portable chest radiographs
 are relatively insensitive for detecting rib fractures, especially those
 involving the anterior ribs. There is no visible pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
