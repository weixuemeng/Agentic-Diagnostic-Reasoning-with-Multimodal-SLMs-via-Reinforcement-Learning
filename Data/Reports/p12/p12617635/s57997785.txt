                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:30 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after an MI with new respiratory distress,
 question volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Septal lines in the left mid and right lower lungs zone are consistent with
 edema, new since ___, but there is also focal consolidation in the right
 upper and right lower lobes, and probably at the left lung base.  Findings
 raise concern for multifocal pneumonia or atelectasis often due to aspiration.
 Borderline cardiomegaly is stable.  Small pleural effusions are presumed. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard
 placements, unchanged.  Subsequent chest radiograph, 8 a.m. on ___,
 showed persistence of edema and some improvement in the consolidation.
