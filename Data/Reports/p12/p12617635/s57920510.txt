                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, weakness, hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___-___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is more prominent compared
 with the prior study in ___.  There is no evidence of interstitial edema. 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe.  Aortic arch calcifications are mild.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Dual chamber pacing leads project over stable
 positions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature may suggest central
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  A repeat PA and lateral radiograph is
 suggested to exclude underlying infection.
 
 2. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly.
