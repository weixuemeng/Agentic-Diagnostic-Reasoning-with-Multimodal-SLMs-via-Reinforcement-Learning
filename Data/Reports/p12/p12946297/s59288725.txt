                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, hypoxia, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar opacities are likely
 reflective of atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded.
