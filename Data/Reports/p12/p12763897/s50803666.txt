                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An enteric tube is seen which courses through the stomach and tip appears to
 be post pyloric in position.  Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 aspiration or infection and appear progressed in the interval.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases are worse compared to the previous exam,
 and may reflect areas of aspiration or infection.
