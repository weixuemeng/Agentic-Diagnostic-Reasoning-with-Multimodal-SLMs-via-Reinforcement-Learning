                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Non-productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Left base opacities are
 likely due to atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Left base opacities most likely represent
 atelectasis, although early infection is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
