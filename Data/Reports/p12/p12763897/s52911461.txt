                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Pulmonary vasculature
 appears engorged, and there is a worsening combined alveolar and interstitial
 pattern with relative sparing of the extreme bases and lung periphery. 
 Observed findings likely represent pulmonary edema, with or without coexisting
 multifocal infection.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in
 this regard.
