                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 posteriorly, of indeterminate acuity.  Otherwise, allowing for technical
 differences, I doubt significant change compared with ___. 
 
 Clips about the lower neck/thoracic inlet again noted.  Stable cardiomegaly. 
 No CHF or frank consolidation.  No pneumothorax detected.  Nonvisualization of
 the clavicular companion shadow is unchanged.
