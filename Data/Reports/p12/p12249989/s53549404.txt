                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diffuse large B cell lymphoma now with
 rigors and tachycardia // Please eval for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which enters the
 duodenum, distal tip not visualized.  The right-sided PICC line is unchanged
 in position. Moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions have increased. The
 presence of pleural effusions makes it difficult to assess for underlying
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification, possibly due to
 atelectasis, is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased moderate layering pleural effusions, which limits assessment for
 underlying pneumonia or pulmonary edema. An upright frontal radiograph or
 chest CT would be helpful.
 
 Newly placed enteric tube extends into the duodenum, tip not visualized.
