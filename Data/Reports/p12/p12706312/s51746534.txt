                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain with deep breathing after falling off ladder earlier and
 landing on right side, right ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.

 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, lungs are clear.  There is mild pleural thickening
 adjacent to the right fifth rib with suggestion of a cortical step-off;
 however, the area of concern is obscured by a crossing sixth rib.  No other
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right fifth rib fracture with small amount of adjacent
 pleural fluid or hematoma.
