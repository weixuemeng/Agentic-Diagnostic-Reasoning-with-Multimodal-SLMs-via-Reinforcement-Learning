                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of rehab, somnolent,
 difficult to arouse.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The
 right lung is clear.  Patchy left base opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis, though underlying aspiration is not entirely excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis,
 although underlying aspiration not excluded.
