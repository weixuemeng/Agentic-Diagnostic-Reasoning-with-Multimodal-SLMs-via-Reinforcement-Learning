                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with neutropenic fever, evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  In the interim since the most recent prior
 examination, there has been placement of a left Port-A-Cath with tip
 projecting over expected region of the distal SVC.  Left apical pneumothorax
 has resolved.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal, with no shift
 of mediastinal structures.  Trace pleural effusions cannot be excluded on the
 lateral view.  Anterior mediastinal mass is less well appreciated on today's
 study compared to the most recent prior examination.
