                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study ___, there is a streak of opacification
 at the left base.  This most likely represents atelectasis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting a developing pneumonia cannot be unequivocally
 excluded.  Central line remains in place.
