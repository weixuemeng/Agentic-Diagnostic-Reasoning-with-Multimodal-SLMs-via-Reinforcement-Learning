                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is a persistent large right pleural effusion with slight improvement in
 aeration of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  A right perihilar
 opacity corresponds to the patient's known mass that is better assessed on CT
 scan from ___.  Multiple nodules are present in the left lung,
 consistent with known metastatic disease.  There is no pleural effusion on the
 left.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is midline.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess due to intraparenchymal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Small improvement in aeration of the anterior segment of the right upper
 lobe following thoracentesis.
 
 2. Large area of opacification remain in right lung secondary to persistent
 effusion and central obstruction.
