                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with metastatic lung cancer and recent thoracentesis, assess
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe, though a large right
 pleural effusion remains.  There is continued volume loss in the right lower
 lobe.  A right perihilar opacity is again visualized, and corresponds to the
 patient's known mass, better assessed on CT from ___.  Multiple nodules
 are again seen in the left lung, consistent with known metastatic disease. 
 The left lung is free of pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinum is midline.  Heart size is difficult to assess due to parenchymal
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration in right upper lobe, however, a persistent
 large right pleural effusion remains with right lower lobe volume loss.
