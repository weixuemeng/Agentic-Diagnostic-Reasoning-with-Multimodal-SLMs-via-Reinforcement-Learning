                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left VATS, left lower lobe wedge, check
 interval changes.

 in the left lower lobe is improved; however, there are persistent areas of
 opacification within the right mid and lower lobes, likely from atelectasis. 
 No significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.  Clips are again noted
 over the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant changes compared to the prior study.
