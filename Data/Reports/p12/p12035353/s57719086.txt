                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is
 slightly decreased in width compared to the prior study, along with decreased
 width of the vascular pedicle, and less engorgement of the pulmonary vessels. 
 Asymmetrical pattern of combined alveolar and interstitial edema has slightly
 changed in distribution, but overall severity is not appreciably changed. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis also appear
 similar.
