                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:14 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with intracerebral hemorrhage.  Question
 infiltrate on prior chest radiographs.
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved and is no longer asymmetrically
 favoring the right lower lobe.  Azygos vein is mildly distended, so the cause
 of the edema could be volume overload or cardiac decompensation.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  Nasogastric drainage tube passes
 into the stomach and out of view.
