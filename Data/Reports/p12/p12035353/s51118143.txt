                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:13 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Intracerebral hemorrhage.  Question pneumonia on recent chest
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph currently
 available ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema, worse in the right lung, is new.  Heart is
 normal in size.  Pleural effusion is small on the right, if any.  The absence
 of cardiomegaly raises the possibility of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due
 to increased intracranial pressure.
 
 Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Small right
 pleural effusion is probably present.
