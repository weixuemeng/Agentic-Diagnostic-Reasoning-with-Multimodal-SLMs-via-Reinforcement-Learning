                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 2:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of CVA, presents with a right
 frontal IPH, SDH and SIH; assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 6:14 a.m.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 2:48 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip coursing below the
 diaphragm and not identified on the current study.  There continues to be
 small layering effusions with bilateral airspace process, which is not
 significantly changed and most likely represents mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 and interstitial edema, although a diffuse pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in positioning and technique between the studies.  No
 pneumothorax.
