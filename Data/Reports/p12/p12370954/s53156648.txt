                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with ulcerative colitis status post
 J-pouch, here with left lower quadrant pain, question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  An oblong hyperdensity in the right lower lung appears to follow the
 margins of a right anterior low rib and is therefore likely a bone island.  A
 well-corticated lucency through the right distal clavicle likely reflects an
 old fracture, which is ununited.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No signs of free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
