                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Edema, cough, COPD, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Lordotic positioning.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 21:11 p.m., I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is the dual-lumen catheter.  The tip itself is not well delineated
 -- it may overlie the uppermost right atrium.  Patchy bibasilar opacity is
 unchanged.  Doubt CHF.  Incidental note is made of a vertical lucency
 projecting over the spine, ? related to spina bifida occulta or artifact due
 to projection of the sternum.
