                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are diffuse heterogeneous
 opacities in the bilateral lung fields, more prominent in the perihilar
 distribution.  There is also moderate cardiomegaly.  Hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions cannot be ruled out due to overlying opacities.  There is
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema likely secondary to decompensated congestive
 heart failure.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  If there is
 continued clinical concern for infection, consider re-imaging after
 optimization of fluid status.
