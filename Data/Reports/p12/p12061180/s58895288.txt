                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever  // PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. Correlation made to chest
 CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An irregularly shaped nodular opacity projecting over the right scapular wing
 in the ___ interspace has increased since the recent radiograph, but new since
 the ___ radiograph and ___ CT scan.  There is no new
 consolidation or pneumothorax. A new small left pleural effusion is present.
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous as
 in the past.
 
 Severe right shoulder degenerative changes are stable. Spinal degenerative
 changes, including multiple compression deformities, are not appreciably
 changed. Metallic right upper quadrant surgical clips denote prior
 cholecystectomy.

 Irregularly shaped nodular opacity projecting over the right scapular wing in
