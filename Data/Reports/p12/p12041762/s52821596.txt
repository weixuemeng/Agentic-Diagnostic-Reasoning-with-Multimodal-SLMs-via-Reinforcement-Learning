                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and diarrhea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, and ___;
 a chest CT is also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear.  Of note, there are multiple air-fluid levels in the
 left upper quadrant, probably colonic for the most, although some are
 potentially associated with small bowel.  There is no clear evidence for small
 bowel dilatation or free air, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Air-fluid levels
 in the imaged epigastric region, predominantly along the splenic flexure of
 the colon, a non-specific finding for which clinical correlation is suggested.
