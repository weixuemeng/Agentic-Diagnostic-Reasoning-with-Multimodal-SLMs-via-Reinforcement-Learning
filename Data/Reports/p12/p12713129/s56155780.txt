                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new fever  // r/o infx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___, a peripheral consolidation in the right upper lobe
 has nearly completely resolved.  A subtle opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region is new and could reflect localized atelectasis, aspiration, or a new
 site of infection.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
