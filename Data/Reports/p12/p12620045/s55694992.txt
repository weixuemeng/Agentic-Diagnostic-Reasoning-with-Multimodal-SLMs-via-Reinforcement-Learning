  1. Right mainstem bronchial intubation. 
  
  2.  Associated left basilar atelectasis with leftward shift of mediastinal
  structures.  Infection or aspiration at the left lung base cannot be excluded.
  Right basilar atelectasis is also is seen. 
  
  3. Nasogastric tube tip likely in standard position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the orifice of the right mainstem
 bronchus, and should be retracted by approximately 4 cm.  Nasogastric tube tip
 courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film.  Left
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis, with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures noted.  Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 may be attributable to low lung volumes, though mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is also likely present.  Streaky right basilar atelectasis is also
 demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is apparent.  Multiple
 remote left-sided healed rib fractures are visualized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Associated left basilar atelectasis with leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures.  Infection or aspiration at the left lung base cannot be excluded.
 Right basilar atelectasis is also is seen. 
 
 3. Nasogastric tube tip likely in standard position.
