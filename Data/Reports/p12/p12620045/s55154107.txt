                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:14 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  New right IJ line in an ___-year-old woman.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 4:53 p.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to standard position.  Nevertheless,
 severe left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.  This could be the residual
 of the contralateral intubation documented earlier in the day, but poor
 definition of the left bronchial tree suggests retained secretions.  ___ be a
 small left pleural effusion, not unexpected in the setting of lower lobe
 collapse.  Atelectasis in the right lung is minimal.  Heart size is
 indeterminate, probably top normal.  Contour of the mediastinum in the region
 of the AP window should be reevaluated when the lung is fully expanded.  Many
 healed left rib fractures are present.  No pneumothorax.  Right jugular line
 ends low in the right atrium.  No evidence of mediastinal bleeding.
