                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent intubation.  Evaluate for
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph obtained 20 minutes prior to this one.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube,
 finishing approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube has a side
 port and tip ending in the stomach.  Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded. 
 Bibasilar consolidation, left worse than right, are better assessed in
 subsequent CT scan.  A small pleural effusion is noted in the left.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar consolidations, left worse than right, might represent
 atelectasis versus early pneumonia versus aspiration.
 2.  Endotracheal tube ending 4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube in
 appropriate position.
