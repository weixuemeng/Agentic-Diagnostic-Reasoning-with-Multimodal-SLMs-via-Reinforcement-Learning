                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper extremity weakness and garbled speech.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in similar position, with
 leads again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The
 heart is again mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Patchy
 opacification of the medial right cardiophrenic angle appears unchanged and
 does not suggest an acute process; it may reflect a epicardial fat pad. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild to moderate degenerative changes
 are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
