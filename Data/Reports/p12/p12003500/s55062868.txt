                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe wedge resection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 extensive atelectasis at the right base.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angle persists bilaterally.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
