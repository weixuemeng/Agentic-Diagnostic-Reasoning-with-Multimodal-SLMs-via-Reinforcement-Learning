                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  History of congestive heart failure and atrial
 fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged and perhaps somewhat
 increased in size.  The lungs appear hyperinflated.  A small pleural effusion
 is suspected on the right side, but not necessarily changed.   Small nodular
 densities at the lung apices are probably consistent with minor scarring but
 nodules could be considered; a subsequent CT on the same day shows no discrete
 nodules however.  A mild interstitial process involving the lung bases
 persists.  Interstitial opacities have increased at the left lung base,
 although this may be due to decreased low lung volumes, but slight increase in
 chronic congestion could be considered.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild
 degenerative changes are present along the lower thoracic spine and there are
 similar lower vertebral compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar to perhaps slightly increased peripheral interstitial
 opacities in the lower lungs, which may be exaggerated by decreased lung
 volumes but superimposed congestion or worsening interstitial lung disease
 could be considered.  Possibilities include sequelae of chronic congestion
 that may have increased somewhat versus intrinsic mild interstitial lung
 disease, a possibility which could also be investigated with CT if needed
 clinically.
