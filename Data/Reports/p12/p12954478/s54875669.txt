                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure, cough, and weakness.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal/slightly enlarged, grossly unchanged since the prior
 study.  Extensive calcifications of the aorta are noted, and mild aortic
 dilatation is seen as well.  There is also evidence of focal dilatation at the
 level of ductus arteriosus, potentially ductal diverticulum, better assessed
 on the prior CT of the chest where also the tortuosity/calcifications of the
 aorta is noted.  Lungs are currently essentially clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Posterior Bochdalek hernia is redemonstrated.
