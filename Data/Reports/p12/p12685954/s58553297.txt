 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with orthopnea  // orthopnea      orthopnea
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged and there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening
 hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Blunting of what
 appears to be the low right costophrenic angle is again seen.  No evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 The area of sclerotic rib lesions with isotope uptake and identified on CT is
 very difficult to appreciate on the frontal and lateral views presented. 
 Specific oblique views of the ribs could be obtained for better evaluation of
 these lesions.
