                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with end-stage renal disease, prerenal
 transplant evaluation.  Assess cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No
 typical configurational abnormality can be seen, but there is a relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly. 
 Thoracic aorta is mildly widened, but does not show any local contour
 abnormalities or wall calcifications.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present
 and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  Mild blunting exists of the
 right-sided posterior pleural sinus, probably representing old pleural scar. 
 No evidence of acute fluid.  No pneumothorax in apical area and no acute or
 chronic pulmonary infiltrates are seen.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent heart size, but no evidence of pulmonary congestion, or
 acute infiltrates.  Patient to be evaluated for kidney transplant.
