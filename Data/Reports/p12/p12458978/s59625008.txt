                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of C1/C2 fractures with high oxygen requirement.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar atelectasis, slightly
 improved compared to the prior exam.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are exaggerated due to low lung volumes which
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Median sternotomy and surgical clips are seen
 projecting over the mediastinum.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Improved aeration of the lungs with persistent mild bibasilar atelectasis.
