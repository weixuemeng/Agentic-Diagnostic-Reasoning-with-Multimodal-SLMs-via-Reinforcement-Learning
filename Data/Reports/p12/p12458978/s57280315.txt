 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dens fracture, complaining of SOB  // assess
 for pulm edema, pneumonia, atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a
 consequence, there is crowding of the vascular structures at the lung bases,
 combined to and a overall clearly enlarged cardiac silhouette. The findings
 would be consistent with mild fluid overload. However, no overt pulmonary
 edema is present. Status post CABG. The sternal wires are in correct
 alignment. Calcified granuloma in the left lung apex.  No larger pleural
 effusions.
