 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:05 PM
  Findings suggesting posterior left diaphragmatic hernia with bowel projecting
  over the left lower hemi thorax versus elevation of the posterior left
  diaphragm.
  
  Subtle patchy opacity at the lateral right lung base could be due to small
  focus of infection or pulmonary nodule
  
  Aortic knob appears dilated raising concern for aortic dilatation. Above
  findings can be further assessed on chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of the posterior left hemidiaphragm/posterior left
 diaphragmatic hernia with bowel seen in the lower left hemi thorax.  The right
 lung is hyperinflated suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Subtle patchy nodular opacity at the right lung base is seen and could
 represent small focus of infection or pulmonary nodule.  Further evaluation
 with chest CT is recommended.  The aortic knob is prominent and underlying
 aneurysmal dilatation may be present, which can also be further assessed on
 CT.  Aortic calcifications are seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 No pneumothorax seen.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine.  .
