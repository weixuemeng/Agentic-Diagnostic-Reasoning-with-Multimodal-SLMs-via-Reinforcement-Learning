                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided weakness for 24 hours.  Please
 evaluate for pneumonia or other process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 Bronchial cuffing could be due to mild congestive heart failure, given
 borderline cephalization of pulmonary blood flow, or, more likely since heart
 size is normal and there is no pleural effusion or septal thickening,
 bronchial inflammation.   The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours,
 and pleural surfaces are normal.  Partially imaged is an anterior cervical
 fusion device.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bronchial inflammation or, less likely, mild congestive heart failure.
