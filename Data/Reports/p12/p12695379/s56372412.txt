                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from Atrius.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  A small hiatal hernia is noted.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Rounded opacity within the
 posterior right lower hemithorax may reflect a focal diaphragmatic hernia, and
 appears unchanged from the previous radiograph.  Remainder of the lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis
 in the left lung base.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified no acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated. 
 Dense material within the colon likely reflects oral contrast material.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Unchanged rounded opacity within the
 posterior right lower hemithorax, possibly a focal diaphragmatic hernia.
