                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest congestion.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 REPORT:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal for size.  There is
 extensive patchy change in the right mid and lower zone, likely reflecting
 pneumonia.  I note what appears to be some downward shift of the minor fissure
 on the right side suggesting a degree of chronicity.  The left lung appears
 grossly normal.  Lateral view suggests some increased retrosternal lucency and
 a pectus deformity.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Findings most consistent with right lower lobe pneumonic process
 in the absence of prior, although there are certain findings suggesting that
 this may be a more chronic process.  Clinical correlation and review of
 outside films if available would be useful.
