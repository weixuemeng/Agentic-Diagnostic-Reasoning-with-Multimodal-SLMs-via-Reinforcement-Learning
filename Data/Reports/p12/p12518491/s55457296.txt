 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, diffuse tree-in-___ opacity, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are slightly
 increasing bilateral basal areas of atelectasis but no changes in the upper
 and mid lung parenchyma.  Due to the slightly lower lung volumes than on the
 previous image, the left hilar area looks fuller but shows no evidence of a
 distinct change in contour.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
