                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:59 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, suggesting that increasing opacification at both lung
 bases is atelectasis, but the appearance in the left lower lobe raises concern
 for new pneumonia.  Close followup advised.  Borderline cardiomegaly and
 vascular engorgement are stable.  Small right pleural effusion is new or
 increased.
