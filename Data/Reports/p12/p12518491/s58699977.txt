                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ from___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is mildly enlarged.  There are patchy basilar opacities
 that could be seen with pneumonia.  The main change is that there is a new
 band-like opacity in the right costophrenic sulcus which suggests a degree of
 atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 PATCHY BASILAR OPACITIES FOR WHICH A PNEUMONIA COULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE
 ETIOLOGY IN APPROPRIATE CLINICAL SETTING.  THE ONLY CHANGE IS NEW BAND-LIKE
 OPACITY AT THE BASE WHICH SUGGESTS SUPERIMPOSED ATELECTASIS.
