                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the scout view from the prior CT, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a mild interstitial
 abnormality that is difficult to compare directly to the prior CT, but
 probably reflects edema and possibly superimposed airway inflammation or 
 slight congestion.  There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  Exaggerated kyphotic curvature with mild-to-moderate
 loss in mid vertebral body heights appears similar.  Regarding the left ribs,
 there are suspected nondisplaced fractures involving the left sixth and
 seventh ribs without displacement.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones
 appear demineralized.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided rib fractures.  Mild interstitial abnormality,
 suggesting slight vascular congestion.  Bony demineralization.
