                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, question interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is slightly rotated to the right on this portable
 frontal chest radiograph.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear increased
 compared with priors.  There is emphysema and increasing interstitial
 abnormality within the right lung more than the left.  The heart size remains
 normal, note is made of marked mitral annular calcification.  Opacity
 projecting behind the heart likely reflects a fluid-filled hiatal hernia. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing interstitial abnormality within the lungs, right greater than
 left, most likely reflects asymmetric edema, though pneumonia is not excluded.
 2.  Hiatal hernia.
