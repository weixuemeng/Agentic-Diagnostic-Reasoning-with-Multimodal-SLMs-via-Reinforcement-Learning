 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased oxygen requirement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the diffuse bilateral
 interstitial opacities, combined to pleural effusions and retrocardiac
 atelectasis have substantially improved.  However, they are still clearly
 visible and small pleural effusions are still present.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally decreased.  There is a
 moderate hiatal hernia.  No new parenchymal opacities.
