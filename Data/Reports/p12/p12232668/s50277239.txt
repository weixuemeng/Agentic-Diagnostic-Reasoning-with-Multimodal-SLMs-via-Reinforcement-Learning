                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The very superior segment of the apices was not well included in the field of
 view.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Osteophytes are noted
 extensively throughout the spine.  Lungs are essentially clear except for
 right mid lung where nodular opacity is demonstrated and might potentially
 represent developing or resolving infectious process.  Followup of the patient
 four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended.
