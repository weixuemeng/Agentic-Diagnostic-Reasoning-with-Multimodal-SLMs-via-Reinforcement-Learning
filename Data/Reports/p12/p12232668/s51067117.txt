                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible esophageal perforation.  Evaluate for pneumonia or widened
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis 7:36 today and chest radiograph 4:00 today.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is minimal increase in lucency surrounding
 the aortic knob and the left cardiac border concerning for pneumomediastinum. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increasing opacity at the
 bases, right greater than left, is likely increasing atelectasis, however,
 developing aspiration pneumonia is not excluded.  A calcified granuloma in the
 right upper lobe is better demonstrated on the CT C-spine from earlier today.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not widened.  A sclerotic focus
 within the left humeral head is unchanged from of ___.
