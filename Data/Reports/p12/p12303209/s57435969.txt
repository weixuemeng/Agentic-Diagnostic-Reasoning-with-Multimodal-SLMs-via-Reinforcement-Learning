 AP CHEST, 5:37 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with GI bleed, suspect aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate mild cardiomegaly, and supine positioning may be,
 in part, responsible for widening of mediastinal vasculature.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion or any indication of pneumonia
 or aspiration.  No pneumothorax.
