                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 2
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam. There is secondary crowding
 of the bronchovascular markings particularly on the lateral. Linear bibasilar
 opacities are most likely atelectasis. There is no large effusion. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified. Bold posterior left rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis due to lower lung volumes noting
 that infection cannot be excluded.
