 discomfort, active smoker  // any infiltrate or edema     any infiltrate or
 edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests
 underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
 There is increased opacification at the left base. Although this could
 represent merely atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 Probable old healed rib fracture at the left base.
