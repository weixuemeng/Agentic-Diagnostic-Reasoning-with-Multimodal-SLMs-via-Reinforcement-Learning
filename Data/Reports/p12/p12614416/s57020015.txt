                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment of the lungs is somewhat limited due to exclusion of the
 extreme left lung base laterally from the radiograph.  With this limitation in
 mind, the imaged portions of the lungs are clear.  Heart size, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia, but periphery of left
 lower lung has been excluded from the radiograph.  If warranted clinically,
 the patient could return for repeat radiograph of this region at no additional
 charge.
