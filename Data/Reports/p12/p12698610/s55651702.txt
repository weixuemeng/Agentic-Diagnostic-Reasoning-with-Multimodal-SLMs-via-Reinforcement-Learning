                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Port-A-Cath tip portion of the SVC
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed. Central catheter extends to the lower SVC. The cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion. Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests underlying chronic
 pulmonary disease, though no definite acute focal pneumonia is appreciated
