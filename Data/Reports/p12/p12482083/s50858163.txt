                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent hiatal hernia repair and
 respiratory failure, evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:47.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 5:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  Left subclavian
 central line is unchanged in position.  There are layering bilateral effusions
 with associated airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There has been interval resolution of
 the pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged given differences in positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Nodularity at
 the right apex is felt to be related to degenerative changes of superimposed
 bony structures.
