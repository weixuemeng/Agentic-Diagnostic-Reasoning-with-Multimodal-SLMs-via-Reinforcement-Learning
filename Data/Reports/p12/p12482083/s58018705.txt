                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a large paraesophageal hernia, question any
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Intrathoracic portion of hiatus hernia looks smaller, but is difficult to
 assess since it no longer contains appreciable contrast agent.  The axilla is
 smaller, and mediastinal veins are no longer as distended.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are no larger.  Upper lungs are clear.  Left basal
 opacification is probably atelectasis related to the large hernia.  Same may
 be true for right basal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube
 ends in the subdiaphragmatic portion of the stomach.
