                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for fluid overload.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar pleural effusions are again seen with compressive atelectasis at the
 lung bases, similar in appearance to the prior exam.  A superimposed
 infectious process should be considered if there are clinical symptoms. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Superimposed
 pneumonia should be considered if there are clinical symptoms.
