                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post paraesophageal hernia repair. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate decreased bibasilar pleural
 effusions with persistent small left pleural effusion with associate adjacent
 atelectasis.  Within the right lower lobe, there is minimal interstitial lung
 abnormalies, less likely to be secondary to cardiac etiology and more likely
 chronic changes.  No pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidation.  Patient is
 significantly rotated.  Allowing for this and differences in technique, the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouette is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved bibasilar pleural effusions with persistent small left pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
 
 Chronic right lower lung interstitial changes, likely chronic.
