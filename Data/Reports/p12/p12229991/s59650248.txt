                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but similar compared to the
 previous study.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There is new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggestive of a
 diaphragmatic hernia which contains colon.  Minimal atelectasis is noted in
 the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild multilevel degenerative changes seen
 in the thoracic spine.  Moderate degenerative spurring is also noted in the
 right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left hemidiaphragmatic elevation, new in the interval, suggestive of a
 diaphragmatic hernia.
 2.  Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases.
