                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated lactate upper GI bleed.  Question pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen from the same day. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes limit the evaluation of the lungs. With this in
 mind, there is bibasilar atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia.  Heart size
 is exaggerated by a epicardial fat pad as well as the low lung volumes.  An NG
 tube is seen coursing into the stomach and curling upon itself.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The right hemidiapghram is elevated;
 the CT from the same day demonstrates liver causing the elevation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study without evidence of pneumonia.
