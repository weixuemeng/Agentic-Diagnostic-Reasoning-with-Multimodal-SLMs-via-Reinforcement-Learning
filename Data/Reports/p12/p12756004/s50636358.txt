                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with intracranial hemorrhage status post
 intubation with question of pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube with tip
 projecting 3.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube traverses below the
 diaphragm inferiorly out of view.  Low lung volumes are unchanged.  The heart
 size is top normal, with minimal unfolding in the thoracic aorta and arch
 calcifications.  The lungs are clear with the exception of trace subsegmental
 atelectasis in the left base.  Previously seen periaortic lucency one day
 prior persists, which remains concerning for pneumomediastinum and/or
 pneumopericardium.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or large right
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent periaortic lucencies raising concern for
 pneumomediastinum and/or pneumopericardium. As suggested before, a CT is
 recommended for further assessment in the absence of known cause.
