                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC has been slightly withdrawn but continues to terminate
 just below the expected location of the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are
 lower than on the prior study with associated crowding of bronchovascular
 structures at the lung bases.  Otherwise, no relevant changes since the recent
 study.
