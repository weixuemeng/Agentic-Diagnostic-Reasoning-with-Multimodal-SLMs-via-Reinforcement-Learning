 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Apical lordotic projection accentuates the cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinal contours.  With this factor in mind, they are probably grossly
 stable compared to the previous study.  Upper zone vascular redistribution is
 present, without evidence for pulmonary edema.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
