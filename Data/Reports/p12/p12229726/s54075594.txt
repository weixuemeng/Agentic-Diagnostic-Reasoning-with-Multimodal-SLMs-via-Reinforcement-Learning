                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:24 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Preop chest radiograph.  Previous severe consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Previous severe colonic distention has improved in the region of the imaged
 upper abdomen.  Severe left lower lobe consolidation which developed between
 ___ and ___ and worsened subsequently is still present. 
 Given the severe cardiomegaly and distortion of the left main bronchus, this
 could all be left lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of severe
 cardiomegaly, particularly left atrial enlargement.  Right lower lung shows
 borderline edema.  There is no appreciable right pleural effusion.  Some left
 pleural effusion is presumed.  No pneumothorax.
