                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ man in septic and cardiogenic shock from presumed UTI
 artery and Gram-negative bacteremia, requiring multiple pressors for inotropic
 support, serial chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON: Exan is compared to CXR of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Right IJ catheter ends in mid SVC.  ET tube ends at 7 cm from
 carina.  NG tube ends in distal gastric cavity.  Pericardial drain is
 unchanged.  Minimal interval improvement of the right lung opacification, for
 reduced pleural effusion.  Left pleural effusion is unchanged and moderate. 
 Heart size is still enlarged, probably due to pericardial effusion.  Central
 vascular distension is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of right lung ventilation for reduced
 pleural effusion and reduced pulmonary edema.  Persist left moderate pleural
 effusion and enlarged cardiac silhouette, likely related to pericardial
 effusion.  All of the monitoring and supporting devices are unchanged.
