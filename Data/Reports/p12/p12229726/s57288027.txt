 HISTORY:  Abdominal distention.  Rule out free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There is mild

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities worse on the left, presumably due to atelectasis,
 however given the extent of chronic consolidation in the left lower lobe an
 underlying infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 
 3.  Increased colonic distension. No free air.
