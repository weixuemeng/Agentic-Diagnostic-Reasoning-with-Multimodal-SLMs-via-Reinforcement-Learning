                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever, left chest pain, HIV positive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 increased interstitial markings bilaterally with a more confluent opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung.  Findings are somewhat similar to prior,
 though it is unclear whether findings resolved in theinterval and reoccurred
 or have been present throughout.  Findings are nonspecific and could be due to
 infection with mild pulmonary edema, but an atypical infection is also in the
 differential.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally with more confluent
 area in the right lung base.  Findings are similar to prior; however, it is
 unclear whether findings may represent chronic pulmonary edema, pneumonia with
 superimposed pulmonary edema or atypical infection.
