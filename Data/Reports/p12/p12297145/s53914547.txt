                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Increased interstitial markings are demonstrated the lung bases, moreso than
 on the prior exam, with more focal opacity within the left lower lobe.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is scarring within the
 lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings within the lung bases with more focal opacity
 in the left lower lobe.  Findings may reflect pneumonia with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, but atypical infection should also be considered.
