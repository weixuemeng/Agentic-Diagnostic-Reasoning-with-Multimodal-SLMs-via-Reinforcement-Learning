                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and fever  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker with 2 leads is seen in appropriate position. Heart
 size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  A subtle, equivocal
 retrocardiac opacity projected over the thoracic vertebral bodies is seen and
 may represent an area of infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Of note, there appears to be some vertebral body sclerosis, not
 appreciated on the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal, retrocardiac opacity seen and in the appropriate clinical setting
 could represent pneumonia. Possible thoracic vertebral body sclerosis, not
 appreciated on the prior examination. Oblique views could be obtained for
 better evaluation of the possible pneumonia and the thoracic spine.
