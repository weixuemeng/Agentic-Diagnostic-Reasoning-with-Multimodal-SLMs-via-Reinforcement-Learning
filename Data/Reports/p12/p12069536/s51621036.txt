                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain, rib pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 Elevated left hemidiaphragm is noted, slightly more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  Old rib fractures are noted on the left.  No definitive new
 fractures are seen but if clinically warranted, correlation with dedicated rib
 views might be considered.
