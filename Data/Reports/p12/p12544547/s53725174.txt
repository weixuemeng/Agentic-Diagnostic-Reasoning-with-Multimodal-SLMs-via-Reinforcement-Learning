  1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
  
  2.  Bilateral asymmetric pleural thickening with calcifications, suspicious
  for asbestos exposure. In this context, interstitial markings may reflect
  fibrosis with possible superimposed interstitial edema. Follow-up imaging
  could be performed after diuresis to further clarify this issue.
  High-resolution CT would also be helpful on a nonemergent basis to better
  characterize the patient's underlying diagnosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB and chest pain r/o infectious process  //
 R/o infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Bilateral asymmetric pleural thickening with
 calcifications is seen, suggestive of prior asbestosis exposure.  Interval
 worsening of basilar predominant reticular opacities.  No focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Sternotomy wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral asymmetric pleural thickening with calcifications, suggestive of
 previous asbestos exposure.  In this context, worsening basilar reticular
 opacities may reflect chronic interstitial lung disease with possible
 component of superimposed acute edema.  Follow-up chest radiograph could be
 performed after diuresis to further clarify this issue.  High-resolution CT
 would also be helpful on a nonemergent basis to better characterize the
 patient's lung findings.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Bilateral asymmetric pleural thickening with calcifications,
 suspicious for asbestos exposure. In this context, interstitial markings may
 reflect fibrosis with possible superimposed interstitial edema. Follow-up
 imaging could be performed after diuresis to further clarify this issue.
 High-resolution CT would also be helpful on a nonemergent basis to better
 characterize the patient's underlying diagnosis.
