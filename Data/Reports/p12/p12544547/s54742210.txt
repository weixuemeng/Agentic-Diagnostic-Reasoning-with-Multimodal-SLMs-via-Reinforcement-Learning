 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weakness.

 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Moderate interstitial markings are
 seen, possibly representing interstitial edema vs. chronic underlying lung
 disease.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 definite acute pulmonary process.  There is right-sided lateral pleural
 thickening vs. extrapleural fat.  Cardiomegaly is seen.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is seen in the aortic arch.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are noted.  The lateral view demonstrates probable coronary stent. 
 Diffuse bone demineralization is noted.
