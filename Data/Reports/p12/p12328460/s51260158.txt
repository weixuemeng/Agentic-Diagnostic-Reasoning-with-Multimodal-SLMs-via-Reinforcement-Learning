                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ s/p partial nephrectomy, now with
 cardiomegaly / widened mediastinum on CXR, concern for aortic dissection. Exam
 can be performed at 17:00  // Please assess for interval change in
 cardiomegaly / widened mediastinum. Also please evaluate new dialysis line
 placement. Can perform exam at 17:00   Please assess for interval change in
 cardiomegaly / widened
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ tube
 as a ___ and 9:22.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Allowing for differences in patient position and level of inspiration there
 has probably been no change in the real caliber of the widened mediastinum
 since earlier in the day.  Acute aortic dissection is not specifically
 suggested by this appearance, but there are no radiographic findings by which
 it can be excluded.  The cardiac contour is unusual, with a bulge along the
 left heart border that does not correspond to the cardiac apex.  There could
 be left hilar enlargement and that would explain an unusual region of
 atelectasis in the left midlung.  Small right pleural effusion is present. 
 There is no the pre left pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 All of the unresolved anatomic questions described above could be clarified
 with chest CT scanning.
