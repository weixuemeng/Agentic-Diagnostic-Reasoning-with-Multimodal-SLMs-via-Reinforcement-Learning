 HISTORY:  Year old man after CABG.  Re-evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ menses preoperative) through ___ 6:24 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postoperative pulmonary consolidation, particularly severe in the right
 perihilar and left upper lungs has worsened progressively.  Cardiac portion of
 the postoperative mediastinal silhouette is stable but upper mediastinal
 widening suggests vascular congestion.  It is difficult to distinguish
 worsening multifocal pneumonia from pulmonary edema on conventional
 radiographs but subsequent chest radiographs and chest CT scan available to
 time of this review show that much of the abnormality, subsequently improved,
 is edema.  The more peripheral components could be small areas of concurrent
 pneumonia or even pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the lower esophagus, repositioned
 appropriately on conventional chest radiographs.  Right jugular line ends at
 the superior caval atrial junction.
