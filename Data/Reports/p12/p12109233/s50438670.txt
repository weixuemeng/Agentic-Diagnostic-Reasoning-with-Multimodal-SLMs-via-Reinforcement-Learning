                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Status post coronary bypass surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 Lines, tubes, and drains have been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  Slight residual blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle suggests a very small effusion.  In the basal left lower
 lobe, there is a focal opacity.  Whether this may be residual improved
 atelectasis associated with fairly recent prior surgery or pneumonia is
 uncertain, but in general the lungs are much better aerated, including the
 left base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity.  This appearance could be due to improving
 left basilar opacification, although new pneumonia in the left lower lobe is
 not excluded.
