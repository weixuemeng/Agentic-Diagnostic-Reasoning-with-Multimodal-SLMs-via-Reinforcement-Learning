                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is somewhat limited by kyphotic positioning.  Heart size is not
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar with unchanged left
 mediastinal opacity in the region of the AP window which correlates to a
 chronic soft tissue density lesion on prior CT.  Bronchiectasis within the
 left upper lobe medially is again noted along with cystic lucencies,
 correlating to a multi-septated lesion seen on prior CT.  Remainder of the
 lungs are clear without new focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple clips are again noted within the upper
 abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar chronic changes within the left upper lobe and left mediastinal
 region, previously characterized as potentially reflective of prior infection
 or a congenital cystic lesion.  No new acute cardiopulmonary process.
