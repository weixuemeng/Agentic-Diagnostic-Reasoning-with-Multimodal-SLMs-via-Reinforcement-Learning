                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Evaluate for evidence of
 acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___; and CTA
 of the chest of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The right lung is clear without focal
 opacities.  The left lung demonstrates apical scarring with hilar traction
 unchanged from prior.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Air cavities
 noted in the anterior mediastinum in the lateral view were seen in the prior
 CT of the thorax and represent postop changes.  Surgical clips are noted in
 the upper abdomen.
 
 Of note, aneurysmatic dilatation of the ascending aorta is better evaluated on
 CT. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrapulmonary process.  Left apical
 scarring and mediastinal air aerated cavities represent stable post treatment
 changes.  Of note, aneurysmatic dilatation of the ascending aorta is better
 evaluated on CT.
