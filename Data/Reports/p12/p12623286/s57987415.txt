                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Night sweats and history of positive PPD.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Assessment of the
 anterior mediastinum demonstrates questionable anterior mediastinal opacity
 that potentially might represent anterior mediastinal mass, but summation of
 shadows is another possibility.  Given patient's history, re-assessment with
 chest CT would be required to exclude the possibility of mediastinal lesion.
