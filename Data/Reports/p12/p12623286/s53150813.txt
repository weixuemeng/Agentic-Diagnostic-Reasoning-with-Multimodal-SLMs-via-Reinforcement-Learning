                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs and pleural surfaces
 are clear.  Although the radiograph was not tailored to evaluate the ribs, no
 focal lytic or blastic rib lesion is detected.  Degenerative changes are
 present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.  If clinical
 suspicion for left rib abnormality persists, dedicated rib radiographs with
 metallic marker at sites of symptoms may be helpful for more complete
 evaluation if warranted clinically.
