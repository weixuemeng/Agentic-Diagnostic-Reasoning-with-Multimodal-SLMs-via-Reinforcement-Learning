                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and tachypnea.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Outside CT of the neck ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest wall pacer leads are in standard position in the right
 atrium, right ventricle and through the coronary sinus.  Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact.  Bibasilar predominent interstitial opacities likely
 reflect moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Heart size is mildly enlarged.
 There is worsening atelectasis at the left base. There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic arch is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased mild cardiomegaly and bibasilar interstitial opacities
 suggesting pulmonary edema in the setting of congestive heart failure.
