                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic resp failure  // eval for edema,
 infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is 6.4 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart
 size and mediastinum are unchanged. Distension of the azygos vein is re-
 demonstrated and although potentially might represent vasculature engorgement,
 lymphadenopathy in this location cannot be excluded and giving the persistence
 of this finding, correlation with chest CT is justified.
 
 Bibasal opacities are present and currently there is more nodular appearance
 in the left lower lobe again would be justified to assess with chest CT.
