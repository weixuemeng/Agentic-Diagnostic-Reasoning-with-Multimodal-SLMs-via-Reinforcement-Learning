                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory failure, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube remains in place with its tip located at least
 5.8 cm from the level of the carina.  A Dobbhoff tube tip is positioned over
 the stomach.  A right IJ central venous catheter tip is located in the lower
 SVC.  A hemodialysis catheter tip is located within the right atrium.  
 
 Linear atelectasis in the left lung base is little changed.  Decreased lung
 volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal, and pleural surfaces
 appear normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tip little changed in position located 5.8 cm from the level
 of the carina.
 2.  Decreased lung volumes from prior, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature,
 with similar linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
