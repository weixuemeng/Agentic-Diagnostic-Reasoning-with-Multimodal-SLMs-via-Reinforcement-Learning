                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and rib pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No marker was
 used to denote the location of patient's pain; no acute rib fracture is
 detected, but the sensitivity of routine chest radiography in detecting chest
 cage trauma is low.
