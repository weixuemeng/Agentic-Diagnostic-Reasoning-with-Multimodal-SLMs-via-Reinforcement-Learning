                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of rheumatoid arthritis.  Severe fatigue.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear streaky opacity at the left base is most consistent with
 plate-like atelectasis.  In comparison to the prior exam, bilateral
 atelectasis is improved and the lung volumes have increased.  There is no
 dense consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Surgical clips are noted in the left
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Improved, but persistent, left basilar
 atelectasis.
