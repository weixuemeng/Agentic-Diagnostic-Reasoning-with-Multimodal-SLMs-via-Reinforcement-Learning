                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes.  Hilar vascular engorgement and interstitial
 edema has increased since ___.  Trace if any bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  A subtle confluent opacity in the left midlung may
 represent pneumonia vs. fissural fluid.   Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Heart
 and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary edema.
 2.  Focal opacity in the left upper lobe may reflect fissural fluid vs.
 superimposed pneumonia. Consider f/u CXR post diuresis.
