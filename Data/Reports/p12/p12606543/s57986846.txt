                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 17:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoventilation, status post trach and
 increasing secretions, question interval change in edema or infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 17:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place and likely unchanged in position. 
 There continues to be bilateral airspace disease which does not appear to be
 appreciably changed and most likely represents stable pulmonary edema,
 although bilateral pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours remain enlarged despite portable technique, but are likely stable
 given differences in positioning.  The lung volumes remain relatively low.  No
 large pneumothorax or pleural effusions are appreciated.
