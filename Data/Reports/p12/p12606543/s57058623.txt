 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. A
 tracheostomy is in standard position. Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding. Vessels are more numerous and dilated than
 yesterday, suggesting mild edema. Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged.
 Bibasilar and left upper lobe inear atelectasis are unchanged.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
