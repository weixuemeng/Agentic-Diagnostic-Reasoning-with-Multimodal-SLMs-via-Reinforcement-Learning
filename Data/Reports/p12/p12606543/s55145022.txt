                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diastolic CHF with increase from dry weight, lower
 extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged and similar in appearance since
 the prior study.  Interstitial pulmonary edema is again seen, fairly similar
 in severity as compared to the prior study.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  A posterior left infrahilar opacity is seen, somewhat
 rounded in contour, not as well seen on the lateral view on ___, could be
 due to underlying consolidation; recommend followup to resolution to exclude
 an underlying nodular lesion.  The opacity measures approximately 2.4 cm.
