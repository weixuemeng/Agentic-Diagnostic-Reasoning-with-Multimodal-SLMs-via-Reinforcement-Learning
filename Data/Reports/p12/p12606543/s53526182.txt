                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary hypertension and worsening
 hypoxia.  Evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ at 00:08.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of
 pulmonary edema since the prior study eight hours earlier.  The left mid lung
 opacity is unchanged acutely and could be atelectasis or scarring, but appears
 to have grown over the past several months, and could therefore be a mass. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Marked cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  A face mask rests over the tracheostomy.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval worsening of pulmonary interstitial edema.  Left mid
 lung opacity and marked cardiomegaly unchanged.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 10:00, at the time the discovery was made.
