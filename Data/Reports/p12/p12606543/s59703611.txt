 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new tracheostomy and Dobbhoff

 obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  The patient has now been
 extubated and a tracheostomy cannula has been placed.  The position is
 unremarkable and no pneumothorax has developed.  Previously identified right
 internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. 
 A Dobbhoff tube is identified and seen to reach well below the hiatus with the
 terminal portion reaching well into the fundus of the stomach.  No new
 pulmonary abnormalities are seen.
