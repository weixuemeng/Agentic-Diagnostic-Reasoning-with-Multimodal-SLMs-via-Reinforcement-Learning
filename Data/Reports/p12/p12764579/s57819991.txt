                                 FINAL REPORT
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ET tube and NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 ET tube was in the right main bronchus.  In the followup study, the ET tube
 tip is 5.8 cm above the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a
 small pleural effusion.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Large left lower lobe
 atelectasis is new.  Left perihilar opacity is consistent with a large area of
 atelectasis.  Opacity in the right mid lung at the level of the chest tube is
 increased, could be due to atelectasis or contusion.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
