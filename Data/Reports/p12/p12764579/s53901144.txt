 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  VATS decortication, new chest tube, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:28 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  New tracheostomy tube, the tip is approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  New chest tubes in the right hemithorax.  Slightly increased right
 pleural fluid amount.  Minimal linear structure to right apex, potentially
 reflecting a small right pneumothorax.  Increase in extent of the pre-existing
 right basal opacity, likely post-surgical atelectasis.
 
 Unchanged are the other monitoring and support devices.
