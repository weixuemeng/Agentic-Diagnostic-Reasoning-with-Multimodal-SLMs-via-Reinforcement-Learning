                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and unsteadiness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits and
 unchanged.  Streaky opacities at the left lung base indicate mild atelectasis.
 A small calcification projecting over the right upper lobe and the course of
 the right anterior fourth rib as well as the posterior right seventh rib
 suggests a bone island or parenchymal granuloma but unchanged. Mild pleural
 thickening appears unchanged at each lung apex.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The chest appears hyperinflated.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
