                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fevers, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour appears
 relatively unchanged.  Calcified right hilar lymph node seen on previous CT is
 not well assessed on the current radiograph. Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present as result of low lung volumes without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities are present within the lung bases which may reflect
 atelectasis. Previously seen 7 mm right upper lobe nodular opacity is
 unchanged, and likely reflective of prior granulomatous disease. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present. Mild degenerative
 changes are noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis, though infection is not
 completely excluded.
