                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia.  Eval for volume status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low, causing crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lungs may
 be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or infection, in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Apical nodularity in the right upper lung is unchanged since ___ and therefore benign.  Prominence of the right heart border is in keeping
 with the known ascending aortic aneurysm.  No new focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusions are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lungs may be due to atelectasis,
 aspiration, or infection, in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Prominence of the right heart border is in keeping with the known
 ascending aortic aneurysm, previously characterized on the chest CT of ___.
