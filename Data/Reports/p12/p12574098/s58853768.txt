                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // r/o acute infectious process      . 
 Review of prior study shows a history of prior adenoma CA of unknown primary
 to brain in ___.  Known right upper lobe with AP window lesions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___.  Targeted review
 of chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diaphragms are flattened, consistent with COPD.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.
 
 Vague rounded soft tissue density in the AP window corresponds the AP window
 lesion seen on the ___ CT scan.  Lesions seen in the right and left
 upper lobes on the ___ CT are not well depicted radiographically.
 
 No CHF, focal consolidation or effusion is detected.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis/scarring and the infrahilar regions bilaterally is similar to the
 prior study.  No new infiltrate is identified.
 
 On the AP view, with the arms both slightly abducted, there is asymmetry of
 the breast shadows larger and/or lower on the right.  This could be
 accentuated by differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 Known left AP window lesion again noted.  Abnormalities seen in the right and
 left upper lobes on the previous CT scan are not well depicted
 radiographically.
 
 Possible asymmetry of the breasts, best correlated clinically.
