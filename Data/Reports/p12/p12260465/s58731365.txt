 // Eval PICC placement      Eval PICC placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian PICC line
 again extends to the mid portion of the SVC.  There is continued opacification
 at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm.  This could merely
 reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 There is also suggestion of less prominent increased opacification at the
 right
