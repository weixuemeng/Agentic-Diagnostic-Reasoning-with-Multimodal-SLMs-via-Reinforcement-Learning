                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and chest CT on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Subtle opacity involving the right middle
 lobe may represent an area of infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. A nodular density is seen in the mid, left lower lobe is consistent
 with known mass, better characterized on prior PET-CT. As before there are
 streaks of fibrosis seen in the bilateral lungs consistent with posttreatment
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity involving the right middle lobe may represent an early focus of
 infection. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
