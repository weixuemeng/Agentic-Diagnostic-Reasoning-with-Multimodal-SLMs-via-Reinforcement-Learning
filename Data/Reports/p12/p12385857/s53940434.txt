                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with gastroparesis and coughing up thick
 sputum, evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two AP single views of the chest were obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  The present frontal views
 with patient in rather left-sided tilted position demonstrate again normal
 heart size and absence of any pulmonary congestion.  Noted are again linear
 peripheral lung densities compatible with scar formations.  The somewhat low
 positioned and slightly flattened diaphragms are suggestive of some element of
 COPD, but no acute infiltrates can be identified.  No pneumothorax in the
 apical area and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.
