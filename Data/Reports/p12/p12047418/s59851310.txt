                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p trach/peg now w/worsening hypoxia.  // Is
 there a new process?      Is there a new process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:___ at
 05:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 05:31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain in satisfactory
 position.  There is persistent complete opacification of the left lower lobe
 which could reflect a consolidated pneumonia but does raise concern for a
 mucus plug with subsequent collapse of the left lower lobe.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Moderate to large left pleural effusion which may
 have a loculated component as most of the opacity is centered around the left
 base and obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  Since ___, the opacity
 at the right base has improved suggestive of resolving right middle lobe
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.
