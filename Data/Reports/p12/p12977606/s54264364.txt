                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tuberculosis.  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is right apical and right
 perihilar scarring.  There are no prior studies available for comparison. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right perihilar and right apical linear opacities are most
 consistent with scarring.  Comparison with prior studies would be helpful.
