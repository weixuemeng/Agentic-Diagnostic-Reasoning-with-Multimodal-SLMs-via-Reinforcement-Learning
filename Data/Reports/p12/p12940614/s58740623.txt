                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pain, s/p assault // acute traumatic process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate well expanded, clear
 lungs. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.  No acute displaced rib
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is
 clinically warranted, the location where there are focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
