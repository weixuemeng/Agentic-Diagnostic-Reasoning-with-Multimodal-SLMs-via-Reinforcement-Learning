  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
  4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left eighth rib posteriorly. This
  could reflect a pulmonary nodule or a sclerotic focus within rib. Comparison
  with prior chest radiographs would be helpful to determine the stability of
  this finding for alternatively bilateral oblique views

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  2 episodes of syncope today.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Pleural parenchymal
 scarring is seen within the lung apices, more so on the right. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  4 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the eighth posterior rib on the left could reflect a
 pulmonary nodule or osseous lesion. Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine
 is present. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. 4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left eighth rib posteriorly.  This
 could reflect a pulmonary nodule or a sclerotic focus within rib.  Comparison
 with prior chest radiographs would be helpful to determine the stability of
 this finding for alternatively bilateral oblique views.
