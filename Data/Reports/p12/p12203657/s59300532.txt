                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain after biopsy, assess for pneumothorax or
 hemorrhage.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies including CT from ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The patient has known mediastinal and hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Multiple lung nodules are better seen in prior CT. 
 Increased opacities in the right lower lobe most likely correspond to
 procedural hemorrhage.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small
 right effusion.  There are low lung volumes.
