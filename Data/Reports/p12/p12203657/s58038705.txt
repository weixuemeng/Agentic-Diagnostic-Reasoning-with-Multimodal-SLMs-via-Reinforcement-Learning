                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with likely septic emboli on outside hospital chest
 x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are multi focal bilateral
 regions a consolidation scattered throughout the lungs bilaterally which have
 a somewhat rounded configuration.  There is no effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple bilateral relatively rounded regions of consolidation in the lungs. 
 These could certainly represent septic emboli in the proper clinical setting. 
 The differential, however is broad and also includes multifocal infection and
 vasculitis or masses among others.  These could be better characterized by CT.
