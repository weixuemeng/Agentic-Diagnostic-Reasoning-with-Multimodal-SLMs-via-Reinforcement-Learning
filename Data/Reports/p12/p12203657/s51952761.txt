                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with acute onset of chest pain following lung biopsy.  Please
 assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, CT chest for interventional
 procedure, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased poorly delineated fluffy patchy densities in the right
 lower lung fields in a patient with a history of septic emboli.  Location
 matches the biopsy site from earlier today.  Multiple similar-appearing
 densities throughout lungs are unchanged. Low lung volumes most notable in
 right likely relates to decreased inspiratory effort given recent procedure. 
 No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The heart size is top normal and
 mediastinal contour is normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity in the right lower lung field is likely related to
 biopsy earlier today.
 2.  Low lung volume most notable in right is related to less inspiratory
 effort from procedure earlier today.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Results were conveyed via telephone to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 1:10 p.m. within 10 minutes of results.
