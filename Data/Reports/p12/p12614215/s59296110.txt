                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer and decreased breath sounds  //
 r/o effusion on right
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities at the right
 lung base and in the mid right lung are constant in appearance. Stability in
 extent and morphology suggests scarring rather than inflammation or infection.
 The extent of the partly organized right pleural fluid is constant.  No new
 opacities seen on the left. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
