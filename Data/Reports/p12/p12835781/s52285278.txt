 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LUL seg  // check interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain decreased.  There is a small left sided pleural effusion
 with a probable tiny left apical pneumothorax. Linear atelectasis at the right
 lung base has improved. Streaky opacities in the left lung base are still
 present and likely reflect mild atelectasis.  Postsurgical changes are seen in
 the left upper lobe. No new focal consolidation identified.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small left sided pleural effusion with a probable tiny left apical
 pneumothorax.
 
 2. Improved atelectasis of the right lower lobe with mild atelectasis of the
 left lower lobe.
