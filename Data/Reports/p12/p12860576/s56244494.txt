                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bulge below the breast, access for incisional hernia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are hyperexpanded
 with blunting of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally, perhaps due to pleural
 thickening or trace pleural effusions, unchanged from the previous
 examination.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The heart and mediastinum are
 unremarkable aside from post-surgical changes and mild cardiomegaly,
 unchanged.  Accentuation of thoracic kyphosis is seen without compression
 fracture.  Valvular prosthesis and moderate hiatal hernia are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with unchanged blunting of the
 costophrenic sulci due to pleural thickening or trace effusions.  
 
 Sensitivity for chest radiographs is low for incisional herniae.  Consider
 cross-sectional imaging if diagnostic uncertainty persists.
