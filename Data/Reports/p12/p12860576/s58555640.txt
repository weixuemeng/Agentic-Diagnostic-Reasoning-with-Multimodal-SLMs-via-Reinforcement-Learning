                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AS, status post repair.  Question volume overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is cardiomegaly. 
 There is prominence of the hilar silhouette, and additional opacity at the
 right base, not fully characterized, but arguably slightly more pronounced
 than on the film from ___.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  No definite consolidation or gross
 effusion.  Clips noted over superior mediastinum and left hilar region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  CHF, with interstitial edema and probably early alveolar opacities.  
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly.  
 
 3.  Prominence of right greater than left hilar silhouettes and additional
 opacity at right base not fully characterized on this exam.  
 
 Addendum - Targeted review of a CT dated ___ suggests that the right base
 opacity may correspond to an area of eventrated hemidiaphragm.
