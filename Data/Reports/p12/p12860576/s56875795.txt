                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, question pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with prosthetic cardiac valve
 noted.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.  Minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.  A large rounded
 density is noted in the middle mediastinum, without fluid level.  However,
 this presumably represents the patient's known moderate-sized hiatal hernia. 
 The density in the right cardiophrenic region is thought to represent a
 portion of eventrated diaphragm with underlying herniated liver (see CT
 ___).
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Cardiomediastinal silhouette and upper zone redistribution are unchanged
 c/w ___; mild vascular plethora has increased.  
 
 2) No acute pulmonary infiltrate identified.
