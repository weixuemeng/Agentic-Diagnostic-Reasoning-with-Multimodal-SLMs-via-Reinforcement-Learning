                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alcoholic hepatitis with new dobhoff
 placement.  // placement of dobhoff; ensure tube is in esophagus
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, a Dobbhoff feeding tube has been placed. The
 tip extends beneath the diaphragm and most proximal portion of the radiopaque
 tip appears to overlie the proximal stomach. The distal most edge of the tube
 lies beyond the inferior edge of these films.
 
 Again seen is a left subclavian PICC line with tip over distal SVC.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. There is upper zone redistribution hand
 diffuse vascular blurring. There is a small left effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation. Some patchy opacity is also seen in the right
 cardiophrenic region and a focal ill-defined opacitiy is seen in the right mid
 zone laterally. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube with the tip projecting over
 the left upper quadrant, beyond the edge of this film.
 2. New left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Vascular
 plethora and  areas of more confluent opacity in the right cardiophrenic and
 right mid zone regions, which are new or more pronounced compared with ___. The differential diagnosis includes developing CHF, areas of
 aspiration, or possible early pneumonic infiltrates.
