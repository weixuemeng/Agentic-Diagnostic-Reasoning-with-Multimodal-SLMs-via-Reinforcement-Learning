                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NG tube readvanced.  // asess position
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ at 01:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An orogastric tube is present. The radiopaque tip overlies the expected
 location of the GE junction and perhaps also the uppermost fundus, but has not
 passed completely beyond the GE junction. Again seen is a left subclavian PICC
 line with tip over distal SVC.
 
 Also again seen is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation as well as vascular plethora and blurring consistent with CHF.
 Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is unchanged. Faint more
 confluent opacity in the right mid zone is new. The right costophrenic angles
 excluded from the film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip overlies both the GE junction and upper fundus.
 Probable CHF, slightly worse. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 and small left effusion similar to the prior film. The possibility of
 pneumonic infiltrates in this setting cannot be entirely excluded.
