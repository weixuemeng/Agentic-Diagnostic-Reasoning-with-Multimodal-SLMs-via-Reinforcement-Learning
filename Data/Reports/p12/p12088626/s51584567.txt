                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with acute bleeding, s/p line  // Eval line
 placement      Eval line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Side chest radiograph performed earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been interval placement of a right supraclavicular large bore
 catheter, which terminates at the level of the upper to mid SVC. A left EJ
 catheter is unchanged in the left neck. The inspiratory lung volumes are
 decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely
 within normal limits as on the outside same day radiograph. No infiltrate,
 effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  Healed bilateral rib fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes slightly accentuate the cardiomediastinal silhouette, which
 is likely normal.
