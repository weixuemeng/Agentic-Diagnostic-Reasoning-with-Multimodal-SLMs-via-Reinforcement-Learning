 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment
 of a nasogastric tube, terminating in the lower portion of the patient's
 neoesophagus with interval advancement of the tube compared to the prior
 recent radiograph.  Otherwise, little interval change in the appearance of the
 chest except for increasing patchy opacities in the left mid and lower lung
 regions.
