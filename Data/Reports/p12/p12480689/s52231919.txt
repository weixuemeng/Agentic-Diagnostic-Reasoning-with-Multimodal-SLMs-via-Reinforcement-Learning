                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  HISTORY: ___F WITH NEUTROPENIC FEVER  // ACUTE PROCESS?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 NODULAR OPACITY PROJECTING OVER THE LOWER LUNG FIELDS, SYMMETRICALLY
 BILATERALLY, ARE LIKELY DUE TO NIPPLE SHADOWS; THIS CAN BE CONFIRMED WITH
 REPEAT WITH NIPPLE MARKERS. OTHERWISE, NO FOCAL CONSOLIDATION, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nodular opacity projecting over the lower lung fields, symmetrically
 bilaterally, are likely due to nipple shadows; this can be confirmed with
 repeat with nipple markers. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
