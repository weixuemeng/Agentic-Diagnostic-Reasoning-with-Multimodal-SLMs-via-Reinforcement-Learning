                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cabg  // eval for effusion      eval for
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the degree of pulmonary vascular
 congestion has decreased. Some of this may merely reflect the erect PA rather
 than supine portable position. The hazy opacification seen at the bases with
 poor definition of the hemidiaphragms has decreased. However, on the lateral
 view there is still evidence of pleural effusion.
