                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Severe fatigue.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.  
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  On the PA view, the lungs
 are clear.  On the lateral view, there is nodular density projecting above the
 aortic arch and over the trachea.  Although this area, 2.5 cm in diameter,
 might potentially represent summation of shadows, lesion in this location
 cannot be excluded and appears to be a new opacity as compared to prior
 studies.  Correlation with chest CT is required to exclude the remote
 possibility of pulmonary nodule.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
