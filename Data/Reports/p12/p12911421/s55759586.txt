                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, ECG changes.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. 
 Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Lung volumes are relatively normal. 
 There are worsening opacities in the left lung and more mild at the right
 base.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The pleural effusions have decreased/resolved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening opacity predominantly in the left lung may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, pneumonia is possible.
