                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o COPD and recent CABG p/w cough and
 shortness of breath. Assess for infiltrate, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple postoperative chest radiographs, dating back to ___ most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild diffuse increased density of the left lung compared with the
 right lung, which has been an usual radiographic finding since the CABG, with
 different degrees of severity on subsequent exams, suggestive of asymmetric
 recurrent pulmonary edema of the left lung. A vague opacity in the right upper
 lung as well as foci of more conspicuous opacities along the inferior left
 cardiac margin and above the left hemidiaphragm, which margins are obscures,
 may represent overlapping infection/inflammation. There may be a small
 right-sided pleural effusion. No left-sided pleural effusion is identified.
 Significant biapical scarring is present. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac
 size is top-normal. Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Asymmetric diffuse interstitial opacities in the left lung is slightly
 improved from the previous exams but a repeated finding since CABG procedure.
 Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric pulmonary edema from ipsilateral
 venous or lymphatic obstruction. If symptoms presist a pulmonary venogram
 could be performed. Aspiration should also be considered although this
 appearance is rather atypical for this diagnosis.
  2. Vague bilateral opacities may represent superimposed infectious or
 inflammatory process. Correlate with clinical signs of pneumonia.
