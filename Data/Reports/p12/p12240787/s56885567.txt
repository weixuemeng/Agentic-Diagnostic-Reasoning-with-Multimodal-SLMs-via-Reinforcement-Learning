                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RUL infiltrates s/p RUL biopsy  // ?
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an opacity in the right upper lobe, a portion of which is wedge
 shaped and grossly similar to the recent CT on ___, accounting for
 differences in technique.  However, more superiorly near the apex, there is
 also increasing hazy alveolar opacities.  This is new from the preoperative
 chest radiograph on ___, and therefore unclear whether this
 represents worsening airspace disease or a component of post biopsy
 hemorrhage.  The remainder of the lungs are otherwise similar compared to ___.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening right upper lobe opacity since the preoperative CXR on ___,
 which may reflect worsening airspace disease or a component of post biopsy
 alveolar hemorrhage.  Close follow-up is advised.
