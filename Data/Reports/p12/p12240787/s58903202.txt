                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new T tube  // r/o PTX      r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs history since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New tracheostomy tube in place is not fully evaluated by this study.
 
 Large elliptical opacity in the right midlung now more clearly defined than on
 ___ could be fissural pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  The
 bulbous contour of the right hilus or adjacent mediastinum is unchanged since
 at least ___, presumably adenopathy.  If there is clinical concern
 for infection, or active malignancy, chest CT with intravenous contrast would
 be warranted.
 
 
 Lung volumes have improved, and are grossly clear.  Previous moderate right
 pleural effusion is substantially smaller or has induced costal pleural
 thickening.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Mild tracheal narrowing and displacement by the large left
 thyroid lobe is chronic.
