 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left pleurx catheter that isn't draining 
 // Please evaluate for kinks, malposition
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  Left basal linear opacity is caused by a skin fold. The
 tracheostomy tube is also unchanged. Unchanged course and position of the left
 PICC line.  The pre-existing opacity in the right upper lobe has substantially
 decreased in extent and severity. The heart continues to be slightly enlarged,
 with retrocardiac atelectasis and a small atelectasis at the right lung bases.
 No new focal parenchymal opacities.
