                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w/ chronic resp failure, s/p t-tube trial now
 with trach back in place, newly tachypnic with coarse breath sounds, concern
 for aspiration vs pneumonia  // ? pneumonia? ?aspiration?    ? pneumonia?
 ?aspiration?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 18:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is now in place and has its tip approximately 5 cm above
 the carina.  Right mid peripheral opacity is increasing and more likely
 reflects loculated fluid in the fissure, although parenchymal consolidation
 should also be considered.   Increasing bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  In
 addition, there is prominence of the interstitium which could reflect a
 component of fluid overload, although no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Right
 paratracheal and hilar fullness is unchanged and likely reflects
 lymphadenopathy as evident on chest CT dated ___.  Blunting of both
 costophrenic angles suggest the presence of small effusions.2
