                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p trach replacement // Assess for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph dated ___.  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube has been inserted. The patient is rotated. The patient has
 had prior right lung wedge resection with stable volume loss.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The left-sided PICC line has
 been removed.  A small left layering pleural effusion has slightly increased.
 A right upper lobe airspace opacity is unchanged. Airspace opacification at
 the left base has increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged right upper lobe airspace opacity which is most likely due to
 pneumonia.
 
 Status post left pigtail catheter removal with increased small left layering
 pleural effusion.  A chest CT may be obtained to distinguish between
 consolidation with aspiration or pleural effusion at the left base if
 clinically warranted.
