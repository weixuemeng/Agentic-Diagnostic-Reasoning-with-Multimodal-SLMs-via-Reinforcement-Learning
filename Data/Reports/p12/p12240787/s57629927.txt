                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of tracheal stenosis status post
 tracheostomy, history of pleural effusion with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is in standard position. Left PICC remains in unchanged
 position with the tip terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic
 veins.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain similar with mild enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette again noted, and widening of the superior
 mediastinum re- demonstrated, attributable to underlying lymphadenopathy. Mild
 pulmonary edema is slightly improved in the interval but persists. Chain
 sutures are noted in the right hilar region with evidence of volume loss in
 the right lung, unchanged. Focal peripheral opacity within the right upper
 lobe adjacent to the minor fissure persists and appears more consolidated in
 the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are
 noted, not substantially changed in the interval, with associated atelectasis.
 There is no pneumothorax. Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is partially
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval, with relatively
 unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Focal
 peripheral right upper lobe opacity adjacent to the minor fissure may reflect
 an area of infection, and appears more consolidated than on the previous exam.
