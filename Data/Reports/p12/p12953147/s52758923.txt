                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper and lower lung wedge
 resection procedures.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  Worsening opacity in
 the right lower lobe near the wedge resection site could be due to localized
 hemorrhage, atelectasis, and less likely a developing infection in this
 region.  Improving opacity in right upper lobe wedge resection site is likely
 resolving atelectasis.  Additional band-like areas of atelectasis are present
 in both lower lobes.  Possible small pleural effusions bilaterally.
