                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper and lower wedge resection, to assess for post-operative
 changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains
 in place.  There is a small apical pneumothorax that is now visible with the
 change in position of the overlying clavicle.  Continued low lung volumes. 
 There is increasing opacification at the right base that raises the
 possibility of developing consolidation.  Engorgement of pulmonary vessels
 persists, consistent with volume overload, and there are atelectatic changes
 at the left base.
