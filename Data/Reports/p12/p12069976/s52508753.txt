                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, dementia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT C-spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The lungs are
 hyperinflated. There is right apical scarring. Large, peripheral opacities in
 the lung apices, right larger than left with focal calcifications in the right
 opacity and right hilar retraction. A large apparent lung nodule at the upper
 pole of the right hilus could be a healed rib fracture instead. Additionally,
 there is a diffuse interstitial abnormality with more confluent opacity at the
 right lung base. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: The findings are most likely chronic and may represent progressive
 massive fibrosis, which can be seen in ___ pneumocosis with or without
 silicosis as well as sarcoidosis. Recommend correlation with patient history
 and prior radiographic studies. If we are unable to show that this is chronic
 and stable from prior radiographs, CT would be helpful for further evaluation.
 
 
 Updated findings and recommendations after attending review discussed with Dr.
 ___ (ED) at 8:45am on ___.
