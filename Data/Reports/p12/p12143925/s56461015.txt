                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cholangiocarcinoma and cholangitis, now with
 fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Small right sided pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis has increased slightly over the interval, and may be
 reactive.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 pneumothorax.  Left-sided PICC line ends in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has
 increased slightly over the interval, and may be reactive. Recommend
 ultrasound of the subdiaphragmatic region to evaluate for abscess or biliary
 collection.  No pneumonia.
