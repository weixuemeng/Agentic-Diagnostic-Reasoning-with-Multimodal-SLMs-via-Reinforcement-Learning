 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, left-sided rales, evaluation for
 pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  There is a minimal middle lobe atelectasis
 but no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No larger
 pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
