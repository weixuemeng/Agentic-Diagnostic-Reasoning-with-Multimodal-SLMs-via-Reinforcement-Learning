                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and fever, status post ERCP, assess for
 pneumonia or free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  A metallic
 stent is seen in the right upper quadrant, likely residing within the CBD. 
 Bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis.  No free air is seen
 below the right hemidiaphragm.  Given the presence of lower lobe atelectasis,
 the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, most compatible with atelectasis.  Please
 note, a superimposed subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No signs of
 pneumoperitoneum.  Stent visualized in the upper abdomen.
