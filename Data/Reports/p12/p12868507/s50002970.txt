                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient status post fall, intubated selectively for MRI.  Evaluate
 location of the endotracheal tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT performed 5 hours prior to this study.
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position below the thoracic
 inlet and its tip is 4 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube is noted with
 the tip below the gastroesophageal junction and the sideport in the lower
 esophagus. The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral degenerative changes of the shoulders are demonstrated, right worse
 than left.  The right humeral head is flattened suggesting prior episode of
 osteonecrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Supporting devices as described
 above.
