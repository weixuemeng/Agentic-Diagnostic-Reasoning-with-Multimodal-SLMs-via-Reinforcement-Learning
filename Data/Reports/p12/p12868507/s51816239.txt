 INDICATION:  Patient with dementia status post fall with left shoulder
 dislocation, new oxygen requirement, concern for aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Low lung volumes with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings are noted.  Opacification within the right medial
 lung base may represent atelectasis vs aspiration/pneumonia.  Band-like
 atelectasis is noted at the right lung base.  Small right pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  Degenerative changes about the right glenohumeral joint
 with bone fragments better seen on shoulder radiographs obtained on the same
 day.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right medial lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis vs
 aspiration/infectious process.  A wet read was provided by the resident on
 call on ___.
 2.  Degenerative joint disease of left glenohumeral and degenerative changes
 with possible fractures of the right shoulder joint better delineated on same
