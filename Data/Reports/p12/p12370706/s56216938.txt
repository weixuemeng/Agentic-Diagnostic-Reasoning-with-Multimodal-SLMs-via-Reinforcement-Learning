                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with uterine carcinosarcoma on chemo (___/taxol) presents
 w/ acute onset SOB and chest discomfort  // r/o pneumonia, r/o effusion -
 decreased breath sounds on R.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, the previously seen right upper lobe region of
 consolidation is smaller and more nodular. Vague left upper lung opacity has
 near completely resolved. There is however new parenchymal opacity in the
 right lower lobe. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
 Persistent right upper lobe nodular opacities which have decreased since prior
 exam. While this may represent resolving infection, the possibility of
 metastatic disease cannot be excluded and therefore followup will be necessary
 after treatment to ensure resolution.
