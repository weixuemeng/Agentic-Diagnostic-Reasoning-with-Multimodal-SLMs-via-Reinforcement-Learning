                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New oxygen requirement and fever, rule out infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The possibility of a patchy pneumonic opacity posteriorly, probably on the
 left, cannot be excluded.  Relative lucency in the lung apices suggests
 background COPD. No effusion or CHF.
