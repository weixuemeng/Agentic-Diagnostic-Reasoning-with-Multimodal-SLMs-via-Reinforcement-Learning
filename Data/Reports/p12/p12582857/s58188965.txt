                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pain and hematoma status post fall out of electric
 scooter on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bullous
 changes at the upper lobes, again consistent with emphysematous changes. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  Patient is rotated to the right.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable
 given differences in patient position.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient rotated to the right and patient's chin overlies the
 medial right lung apex, partially obscuring the view.  Given the above,
 pulmonary emphysematous changes are again seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  No definite displaced fracture; however, limited evaluation of
 the lateral ribs, and if high concern for fracture, suggest dedicated rib
 series.
