                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal and one lateral chest radiograph were obtained.  There
 is a background of bullous emphysema.  Opacity previously seen projecting over
 the lower portion of the spine may represent a focal consolidation.  No other
 areas of concerning consolidation are identified.  There is linear opacity at
 the right base.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The appearance of the heart
 and mediastinum are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity at the right base could represent atelectasis, or
 a small focus of consolidation. Suggest follow-up to resolution given the
 background COPD.
