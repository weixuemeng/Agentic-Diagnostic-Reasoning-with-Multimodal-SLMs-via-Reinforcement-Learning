                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is present.  There are minimal
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta.  Mediastinal contours
 otherwise are unremarkable.  Diffuse hazy opacities are noted bilaterally,
 with probable small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
 noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild anterior wedge deformity at the
 thoracolumbar junction is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse hazy ill-defined opacities in the lungs may reflect mild pulmonary
 edema, though an atypical infectious process cannot be completely excluded. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Mild anterior
 wedge compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction, age indeterminate.
