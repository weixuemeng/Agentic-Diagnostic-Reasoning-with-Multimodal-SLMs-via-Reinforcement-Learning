  1. Mild reticular pattern throughout the lungs can be seen with fibrotic lung
  disease.
  2. Right lower and mid lung atelectasis.
  3. Asymmetric vascular congestion primarily involving the right mid and lower
  lung.
  4. Small right pleural effusion.
  5. Persistent mild cardiomegaly with tortuous aorta.
  6. Apparent widening of the mediastinal contour is most likely related to
  patient positioning and low lung volumes. If clinical concern consider repeat
  frontal chest radiograph with patient centered.
  7. Interval progression of now severe anterior compression fracture at
  thoracolumbar junction, age indeterminate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Cold arm, preop evaluation. Assess cardiomegaly. Assess for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mild reticular pattern
 throughout the lungs suggestive of fibrotic lung disease. Right lower and mid
 lung atelectasis is present. Heterogeneous opacity within the right mid and
 lower lung is most consistent with combination of atelectasis and asymmetric
 vascular congestion.
 
 Small amount of fluid within the minor fissure. Small right pleural effusion
 is present. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is
 noted. A tortuous aorta is present. Apparent widening of the mediastinal
 contour is most likely related to patient positioning and low lung volumes.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Limited
 assessment of osseous structures demonstrate interval progression of now
 severe anterior compression fracture at thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild reticular pattern throughout the lungs can be seen with fibrotic lung
 disease.
 2.  Right lower and mid lung atelectasis.
 3.  Asymmetric vascular congestion primarily involving the right mid and lower
 lung.
 4.  Small right pleural effusion.
 5.  Persistent mild cardiomegaly with tortuous aorta.
 6.  Apparent widening of the mediastinal contour is most likely related to
 patient positioning and low lung volumes. If clinical concern consider repeat
 frontal chest radiograph with patient centered.
 7.  Interval progression of now severe anterior compression fracture at
 thoracolumbar junction, age indeterminate.
