                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse prominence
 of interstitial markings consistent with some combination of vascular
 congestion and chronic lung disease.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
 seen and there is no pneumothorax.  Extrapleural mass is again seen in the
 right upper zone laterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
