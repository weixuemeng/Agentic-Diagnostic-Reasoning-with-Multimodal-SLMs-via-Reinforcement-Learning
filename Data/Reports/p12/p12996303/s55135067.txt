 greater than left, are essentially unchanged from previous imaging.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  A chest tube is again seen in place on the
 left.  There is no pneumothorax.   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest tube in place with no pneumothorax.  Essentially unchanged
