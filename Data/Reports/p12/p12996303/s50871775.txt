                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer, bilateral
 pleural effusions who spiked a fever,? pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained with the patient in
 the upright position.  Heart size is stable.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Coarse opacifications seen previously at the right base are
 relatively unchanged. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Stable small right
 pleural effusion.  Small left pleural effusion has increased in size. 
 Increased density of left lung opacifications is consistent with
 consolidation. No pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacification of the left lower lobe is consistent with
 consolidation and pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 context.
 2.  Increased small left pleural effusion.
