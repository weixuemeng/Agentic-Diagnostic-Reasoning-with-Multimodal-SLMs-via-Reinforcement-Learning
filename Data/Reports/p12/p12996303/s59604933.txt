 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer, pleural effusions, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement in
 severity and extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities in both lungs. 
 The opacities, however, are still clearly visible.  No evidence of larger
 pleural effusion, but the lateral radiograph shows basal areas of atelectasis.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
