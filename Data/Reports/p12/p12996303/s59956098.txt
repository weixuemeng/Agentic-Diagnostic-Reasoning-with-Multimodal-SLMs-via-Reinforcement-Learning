 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent pleural effusion,
 evaluation for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved
 ventilation at both lung bases.  Otherwise, the radiographic appearance of the
 lungs is unchanged.  Unchanged cardiomegaly, unchanged extensive parenchymal
 opacities, right more than left, unchanged position of the right chest tubes. 
 The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
