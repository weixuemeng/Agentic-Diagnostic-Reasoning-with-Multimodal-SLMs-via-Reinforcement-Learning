                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is a moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion.  A pleural effusion is also suspected on the left.  A mild
 interstitial abnormality is predominantly perihilar and suggests pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Prominence of each hilum also probably reflects
 mediastinal adenopathy as does widening of the right paratracheal stripe. 
 Pulmonary nodules are not well assessed.  Suture material projects over the
 left lower chest as before.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right-sided pleural effusion and findings suggesting
 fluid overload or mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.
