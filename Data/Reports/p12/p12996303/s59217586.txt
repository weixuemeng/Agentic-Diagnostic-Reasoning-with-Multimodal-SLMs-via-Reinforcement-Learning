                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia after pleuroscopy and talc pleurodesis.  Please evaluate
 for residual disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable chest radiograph demonstrates appearance of a widened mediastinum,
 likely exaggerated by patient rotation; however, may also be due to increased
 lymphadenopathy.  Extensive increased interstitial prominence extending from
 the right infrahilar region is suggestive of worsening lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis given.  Increased opacifications in the left retrocardiac space
 as well as mid lung, likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious
 process. No overt pulmonary edema evident.
 
  Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with near resolution of right
 pleural effusion and development of subcutaneous emphysema. No pneumothorax
 evident.  Small left pleural effusion may be minimally increased compared to
 prior study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resolution of right-sided pleural effusion with placement of new
 right chest tube. No pneumothorax.
 2.  Newly apparent increased diffuse interstitial markings on the right,
 concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
 3.  Increased left lower lung consolidation may represent combination of small
 left pleural effusion and atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious
 process.
