 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities are constant in extent and
 severity.  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.  The
 lateral radiograph confirms the presence of minimal pleural effusions.  No
 other relevant changes.  A previously placed drain projecting over the right
 upper quadrant is no longer visible.
