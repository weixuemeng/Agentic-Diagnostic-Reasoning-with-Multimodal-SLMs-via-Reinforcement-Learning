                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS AND LEFT-SIDED
 DECUBITUS.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  An additional left-sided
 down decubitus film was obtained.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  The previously observed and
 described parenchymal densities in the right hemithorax remain and represent
 the patient's advanced lung cancer.  Mild mediastinal shift towards the right
 indicating lower lobe volume, appears unchanged.  Linear basal atelectasis on
 the left base as before and mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus is
 identified.  No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates in the left
 hemithorax.  The lateral view demonstrates that the pleural effusion extends
 into the posterior pleural sinus, which appears blunted.  The left lateral
 decubitus image clearly demonstrates about 2-3 cm high fluid level along the
 lateral chest wall. An estimate suggests that this amounts to about 500 mL. 
 No pneumothorax can be identified on either side.
