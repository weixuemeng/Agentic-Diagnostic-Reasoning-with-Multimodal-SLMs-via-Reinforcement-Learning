                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleurx catheter placement, to assess pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the Pleurx catheter on the left.  The degree of opacification at
 the left base is less prominent, though much of this may merely reflect the
 true upright position.  Right effusion is again seen as well as a loculated
 collection of fluid laterally in the upper zone on the right.  Volume loss at
 the bases is again noted, with continued patchy opacification in the right mid
 and lower zones that could represent regions of consolidation.
