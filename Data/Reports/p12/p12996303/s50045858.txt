 INDICATION:  Metastatic lung cancer with persistent pleural effusions. 
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged to slightly worse. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is a persistent small left
 pleural effusion and no right pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.
