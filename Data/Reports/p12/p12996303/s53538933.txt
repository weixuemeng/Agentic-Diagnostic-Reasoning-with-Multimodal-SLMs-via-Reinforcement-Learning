                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:04 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right PleurX catheter for effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right apical pleural tube still in place.  No pneumothorax.  Residual effusion
 is small and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall and neck has
 almost entirely resolved.  Moderate pulmonary edema, has worsened since ___, and in addition to the large right hilar or juxtahilar mass, there is
 suggestion of new consolidation in both the right suprahilar lung and at the
 left lung base medially.  How much of that is asymmetric edema, atelectasis or
 even fissural pleural fluid is impossible to say, but raises a real concern
 for pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly stable.  No pneumothorax.
