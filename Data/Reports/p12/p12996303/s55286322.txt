                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, status post chest tube, evaluation for changes
 after pleurodesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the two right-sided chest
 tubes are in unchanged position.  Bilaterally, the extent of pleural effusion
 has increased and, as a consequence, the lung parenchyma at the lung bases is
 denser than before.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The amount of soft
 tissue air is smaller than before.  A small lucency at the level of the aortic
 arch is no longer visible.
