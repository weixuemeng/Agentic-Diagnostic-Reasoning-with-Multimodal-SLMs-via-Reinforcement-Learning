 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube
 and other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  Again
 there is severe diffuse infiltrate of pulmonary disease bilaterally, more
 prominent on the right.  The cavitary lesion in the left upper zone is not as
 well appreciated, though its inferior margin is quite well seen. Specifically,
 no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
