 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman O2 dependent COPD, HTN, + HLD, PVD s/p
 bilateral common iliac artery stenting, presenting for NSTEMI with known CAD
 lesion, with WBC elevation and focal exam findings concerning for PNA  //
 Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aorta is heavily calcified. Bilateral apical opacities
 are extensive, most likely chronic giving the upwards shift of the hila
 although infectious process cannot be excluded. A left basal and to lesser
 extent right basal opacity and noted as well. Overall the findings might
 potentially reflect infectious process in the process but more colonic
 etiology is per for pole. If No previous studies available for comparison,
 father assessment with chest CT is to be considered.
