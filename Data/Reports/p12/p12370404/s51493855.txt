 Heterogeneous opacification of both lungs, sparing only the left midlung, has
 worsened, probably a combination of pulmonary edema and disseminated
 infection.  Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly smaller.  The
 asymmetric thickening of the left apical pleural margin, due to peripheral
 consolidation and the adjacent cavitation are unchanged.
 Heart is normal size.  ET tube and right jugular line are in standard
 placements and a nasogastric tube passes to the low stomach.  No pneumothorax.
