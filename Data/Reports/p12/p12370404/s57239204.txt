                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD and respiratory distress now s/p
 intubation  // s/p intubation      s/p intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 8:46 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large scale opacification of the right lung has worsened, consistent with
 progressive pneumonia or aspiration or hemorrhage.  Relative sparing of the
 left midlung is the reason I do not call this asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 
 New endotracheal tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
 upper stomach but would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports
 beyond the gastroesophageal junction.  Moderate right and small left pleural
 effusions are smaller.
 
 See the report of the subsequent chest radiographperformed at 15:33, dictated
 previously.
