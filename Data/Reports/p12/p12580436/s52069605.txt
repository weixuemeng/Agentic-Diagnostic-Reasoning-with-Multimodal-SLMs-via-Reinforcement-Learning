                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is calcification of the aortic knob. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Increased opacity at the right lung
 base likely reflects a moderate sized pleural effusion.  However, an
 underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  The upper lungs are
 essentially clear.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate right pleural effusion, an underlying infectious process
 however cannot be excluded.
