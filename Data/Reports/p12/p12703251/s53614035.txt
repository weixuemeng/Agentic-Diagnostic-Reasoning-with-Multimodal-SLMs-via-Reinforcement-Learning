                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is left basilar opacity compatible with
 pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis and consolidation is also
 possible.  Linear opacity at the right lung base is most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to delineate given left base opacity.  Degenerative changes are
 noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis and
 possible underlying consolidation.  Clinical correlation suggested.  Probable
 right basilar atelectasis.
