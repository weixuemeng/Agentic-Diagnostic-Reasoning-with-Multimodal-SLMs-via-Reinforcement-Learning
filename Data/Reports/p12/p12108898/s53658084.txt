                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough - already on levaquin for
 Right middle lobe PNA, pt with worsening symptoms.  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Bilateral diaphragmatic eventration is unchanged from the prior
 examination.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis is noted.  Asymmetrical
 opacity overlying the first costochondral junction is present.  The right lung
 and upper left lung are otherwise grossly clear.  There is no large pleural
 effusion identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within
 normal limits.  Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is noted involving
 the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and left retrocardiac atelectasis.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Asymmetric opacities noted overlying the first costochondral junction. 
 Findings may be degenerative in nature, although an overlying pulmonary nodule
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend apical lordotic views for further assessment.
