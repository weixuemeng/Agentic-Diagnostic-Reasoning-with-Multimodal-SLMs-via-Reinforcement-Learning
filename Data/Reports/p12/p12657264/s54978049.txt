 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with prior study, lung volumes are lower and increasing
 bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. Allowing for differences in
 technique and positioning, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is
 no large effusion or pneumothorax. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with
 no overt pulmonary edema. Port-A-Cath with tip at the cavoatrial junction is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes with increased bibasilar atelectasis, otherwise unchanged.
