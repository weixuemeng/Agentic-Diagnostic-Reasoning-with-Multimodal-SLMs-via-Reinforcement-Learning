 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis. Lungs are hyperinflated. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Loss of height anteriorly of
 an upper lumbar vertebral body is unchanged from the previous CT.

 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
