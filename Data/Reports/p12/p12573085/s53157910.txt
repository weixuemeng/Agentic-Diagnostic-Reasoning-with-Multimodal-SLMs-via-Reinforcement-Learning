                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ongoing hypoxia s/p hepatectomy due to PNA
 vs atelectasis  // ? interval change      ? interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is hazy opacification at
 the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm consistent with moderate
 layering right pleural effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis.  Areas of
 opacification at the left base most likely are related to atelectasis, though
 in the appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
