 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is a somewhat indistinct area of
 increased opacification at the right base.  Although this could merely room
 reflect atelectasis common the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered, especially in the absence of a lateral
 view.  Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild
 elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
