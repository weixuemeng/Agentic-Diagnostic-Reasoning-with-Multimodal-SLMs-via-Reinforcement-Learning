                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggests some chronic pulmonary disease, but no acute focal pneumonia.  No
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 There is some prominence of the region of the pulmonary outflow tract.  This
 could be a normal finding, though if there are appropriate clinical murmurs,
 the possibility of pulmonic stenosis would have to be considered.
