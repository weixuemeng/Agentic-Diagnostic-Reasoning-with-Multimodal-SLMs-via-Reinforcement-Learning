                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, increase shortness of breath, COPD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A moderate size right pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the
 previous exam.  Right basilar opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.  Aeration of the left lung base is improved
 with residual streaky opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of the moderate right pleural effusion.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema
 vascular congestion is demonstrated.  Small left pleural effusion has
 decreased in size.  There is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are seen
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased size of moderate right pleural effusion.  Decreased size of small
 left pleural effusion.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, worse on the
 right and improved on the left may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
