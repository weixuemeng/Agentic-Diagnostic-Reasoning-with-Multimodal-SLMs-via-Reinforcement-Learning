                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right sided chest tube  // Right sided chest
 tube      CHEST TUBE PULLED ; R/O EFFUSIONS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous small, loculated, right basal pneumothorax has nearly filled with
 fluid.  There is no pleural air elsewhere in the right chest.  In the setting
 of pulmonary vascular congestion the greater opacification in the right lower
 lung could be dependent edema and atelectasis.  More severe consolidation at
 the left base is long-standing, probably atelectasis or chronic consolidation
 associated with chronic left pleural effusion.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  Overall hyperinflation indicates severe emphysema.
