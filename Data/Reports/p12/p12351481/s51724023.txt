 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, both the left and the right pleural
 effusions have substantially decreased in extent. Also decreased are the
 pre-existing areas of atelectasis. Signs of pulmonary edema are no longer
 present. A small retrocardiac atelectasis is visualized but there is no
 evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax, a hyperlucent line paralleling the
 left chest wall is caused by a skin fold.
