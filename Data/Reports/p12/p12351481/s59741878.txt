 infiltrate, interval change, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.
 Again there are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left and small to
 moderate on the right.  Area of increased opacification is again seen in the
 left mid zone, worrisome for superimposed pneumonia.  The prominence of
 pulmonary vascularity seen on the previous study is not definitely appreciated
 at this time, consistent with some improving pulmonary vascular congestion.
