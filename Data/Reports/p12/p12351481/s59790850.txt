                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, weight gain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic knob.  Moderate
 pulmonary edema is similar to that seen on the previous examination.  There
 are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, perhaps
 minimally decreased in the interval.  Ill-defined consolidative airspace
 opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated, potentially reflecting a
 combination of atelectasis and infection or aspiration.  No definite
 pneumothorax is detected on this examination, and a previously noted air-fluid
 level within the right lung base is not clearly delineated on the current
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar consolidative airspace
 opacities may reflect a combination of atelectasis and infection or
 aspiration.
