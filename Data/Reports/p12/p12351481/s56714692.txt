                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, congestive heart failure, and recent pneumonia
 presenting with dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest radiograph from ___. CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph at the end of ___, there is been an interval
 increase in the size of the small right pleural effusion which is layering
 laterally and into the fissure.  An opacity at the right base has also
 increased, and may represent pneumonia or rounded atelectasis.  The moderate
 left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis are not significantly
 changed. The spiculated lesion seen on the prior CT in the left upper lobe is
 not appreciated on today's radiograph. The previously identified vascular
 congestion has improved. There is no pneumothorax. Mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity have increased since the
 end of ___.  The opacity may represent pneumonia. Alternatively, this
 could represent rounded atelectasis adjacent to the effusion. Clinical
 correlation is recommended.
 2. Unchanged left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
 3.  Interval improvement in the vascular congestion since the radiograph from
 two days ago.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:28 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
