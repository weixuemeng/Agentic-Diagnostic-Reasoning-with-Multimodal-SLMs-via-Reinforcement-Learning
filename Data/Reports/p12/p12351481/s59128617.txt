                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube  // ? ptx      ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___:55, with insertion of a right basal pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter, most of the previous moderate right pleural effusion has
 been evacuated.  Small localized pneumothorax is new.  Opacification in the
 right lower lobe could be atelectasis alone or there could be pneumonia. 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Left lower lobe is chronically
 atelectatic reflected in elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and leftward
 mediastinal shift.  Overall lung volumes are large, due to emphysema or
 obstructive lung disease.  Moderate cardiomegaly is underestimated as a
 result.
