 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged heart.  Obscuration of
 bilateral costophrenic angles is suggestive of pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.  Right hilar opacity appears to have been present on prior
 examination.  New opacity projects over the right lower lung zone, concerning
 for infectious process.  Overall appearance of the left hemi thorax is similar
 relative to prior examination.  Retrocardiac airspace opacities persist. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema or evidence of a pneumothorax.  Prominent
 central pulmonary vasculature is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  New consolidation
 projects over the right lower lung zone worrisome for infection. Prominent
