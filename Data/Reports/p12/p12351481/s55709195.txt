                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a a perhaps very mildly decreased moderate to large left-sided
 pleural effusion with presumed atelectasis of parts of the lingula and left
 lower lobe, noting mild leftward shift suggesting volume loss. Small pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening on the right appears unchanged with opacities
 at the right lung base suggestive of chronic unchanged round atelectasis.
 Irregular pulmonary architecture suggest emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent pleural effusions. Emphysema. Heterogeneous opacity seen on the
 prior chest CT in the left upper lobe is not well assessed, difficult to see
 on radiographs, so it is not possibly to exclude whether is may persist.
 
 Short-term follow-up chest CT is recommended to reassess.  Findings and
 recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:30 am on ___ by
 telephone.
