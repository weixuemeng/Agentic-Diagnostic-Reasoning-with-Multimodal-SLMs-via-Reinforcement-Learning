                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due to
 small pleural effusions and/ or pleural thickening.  Right mid to lower lung
 opacity is seen raising concern for pneumonia.  There is also for subtle left
 base opacity and possible small left upper lobe patchy opacity.  Prominence of
 bilateral perihilar vasculature suggests vascular congestion.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings concerning for pneumonia, possibly multifocal.  Vascular congestion. 
 Small pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.
