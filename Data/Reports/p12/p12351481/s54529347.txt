                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate to large pleural effusion on the left which is similar in
 size allowing for differences in technique.  There is probably associated
 atelectasis of the lingula and left lower lobe.  On the right, there is a
 small pleural effusion with curvilinear peripheral opacification which
 suggests round atelectasis.  The degree of effusion on the right side has
 decreased.  Otherwise, there has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent left-sided pleural effusion.
 2.  Decrease in small right-sided pleural effusion with round atelectasis.
