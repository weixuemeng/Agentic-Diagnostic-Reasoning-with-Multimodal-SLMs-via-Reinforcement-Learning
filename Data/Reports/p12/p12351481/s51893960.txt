                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, recent PNA  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with areas of increased opacification
 involving the bilateral lung bases.  Though the right basilar opacity has
 remained relatively stable since the prior examination, there has been
 progressive opacity at the left lung base.  Though some of this may represent
 edema with atelectasis, underlying aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded. 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged since the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, largely
 similar to prior examination.
 2.  Worsening left basilar opacity may be consistent with aspiration/pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical context.
