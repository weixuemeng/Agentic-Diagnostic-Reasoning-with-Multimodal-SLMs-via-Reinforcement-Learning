                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Six weeks of cough with diffuse rhonchi.
 
 FINDINGS:  The area of increased opacification at the right base has cleared. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion.  There is a vague suggestion of increased opacification
 in the retrocardiac region which is difficult to evaluate since there has been
 no recent lateral view.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia in this
 region cannot be unequivocally excluded.
