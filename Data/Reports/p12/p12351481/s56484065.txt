 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Small to moderate size
 bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged, right greater than
 left. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No new
 areas of focal consolidation are present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute
 osseous abnormality detected.

 Little overall change compared to the prior exam with small to moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
