                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough  // cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent partial left lower lobe collapse.  Left perihilar opacity
 is similar.  There has been interval increase and opacity along the lateral
 right mid to lower lung suggesting a moderate to large pleural effusion, which
 may be partially loculated.  Medial right base opacity may be due to
 atelectasis, infection, or aspiration.  There is likely component of
 underlying a mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity along the lateral right mid to lower hemi thorax most likely
 moderate to large pleural effusion which may be partially loculated.  Medial
 right base opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection, or aspiration.  Also
 likely underlying mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Persistent left lower
 lobe volume loss.
