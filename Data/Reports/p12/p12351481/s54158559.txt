                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval intubation
 with ET tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube extends
 inferiorly out of view into the stomach.  There is persistent perihilar
 vascular congestion with more confluent bilateral lower lobe opacities, which
 could represent congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, although
 supervening infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Small pleural
 effusions may be present.  Incidental note is made of bilateral glenohumeral
 degenerative disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New ET tube in appropriate position without pneumothorax.
 2.  Slight interval worsenining of pulmonary edema and more confluent lower
 lobe opacities, raising question of supervening infection, particularly in the
 right lower lobe.  Suggest follow-up to resolution following treatment to
 exclude underlying mass in the right lower lobe.
