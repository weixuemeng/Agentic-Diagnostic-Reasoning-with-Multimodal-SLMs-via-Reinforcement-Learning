                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, hypoxia, low grade fever  //
 pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal contour similar with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Perihilar haziness with
 vascular indistinctness and increased interstitial opacities are compatible
 with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions persist, not substantially changed.  More focal
 patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of infection or
 aspiration.  No pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes are noted
 within both acromioclavicular joints as well as within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with similar appearance of
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal bibasilar airspace opacities
 could reflect infection or aspiration.
