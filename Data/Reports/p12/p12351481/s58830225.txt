                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, similar in
 amount as compared to the prior study. A small right pleural effusion appears
 decreased but persistent. Right basilar opacity may be due to overlying
 atelectasis although a consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No
 pneumothorax is seen. There appears to be mild vascular congestion as well.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent large left pleural effusion. Left mid lung zone consolidative
 opacity has decreased in the interval.
 
 Small right pleural effusion appears decreased. Increased right basilar
 opacity may be due to overlying atelectasis although consolidation is not
 excluded.
 
 Mild vascular congestion.
