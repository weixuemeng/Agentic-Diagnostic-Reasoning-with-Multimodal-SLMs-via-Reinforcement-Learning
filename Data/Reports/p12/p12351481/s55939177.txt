                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with ___, dyspnea, hypoxia  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning is noted.  Right basilar opacity is compatible with at
 least some component of pleural effusion.  Distortion of the underlying
 parenchyma may be due to scarring and likely atelectasis.  Superimposed
 infection would certainly be possible.  There is suggestion of a nodular
 density at the right lung base as seen on prior.  Possible small left pleural
 effusion is also suspected.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is noted, not
 grossly changed given differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely in part due to pleural effusions and atelectasis
 noting that superimposed infection is entirely possible.  Nodular opacity
 projecting over the right lung base for which followup will be necessary and
 proximally with PA and lateral views if patient is amenable.
