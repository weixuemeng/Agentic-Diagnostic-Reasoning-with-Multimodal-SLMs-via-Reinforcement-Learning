                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, there is a similar appearance of the chest compared to the prior
 study. Large left pleural effusion, with overlying atelectasis and findings
 compatible with known chronic aspiration are again seen. Smaller right pleural
 effusion and basilar consolidation are similar. Superimposed mild vascular
 congestion is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with underlying severe
 emphysema and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Similar appearance of
 bilateral opacities likely reflect chronic aspiration versus pneumonia.
