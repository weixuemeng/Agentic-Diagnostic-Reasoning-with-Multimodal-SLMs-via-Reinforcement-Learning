                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:38 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with multifocal pneumonia.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 More consolidation in the right lower lung suggests recurrence of pneumonia. 
 As noted before, I cannot say whether there is a mass in the right lung or
 whether there are chronic changes from a previous episode of pneumonia 
 because we have no chest radiographs between ___ and ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are
 exaggerated by lower lung volumes, but I suspect the patient is on the edge of
 cardiac decompensation.  Pleural effusions though are small if any.
