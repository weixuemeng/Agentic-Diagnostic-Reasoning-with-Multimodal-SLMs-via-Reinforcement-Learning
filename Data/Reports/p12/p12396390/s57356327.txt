                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage status post
 intubation, here to evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single supine portable frontal radiograph of the chest
 demonstrates an ET tube with the tip terminating 1.3 cm from the carina which
 needs to be retracted 2-3 cm for appropriate positioning.  An orogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the port in the expected location of
 the stomach.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac
 opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border may
 represent a developing infiltrate or atelectasis.  Right base atelectsais is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely assessed but maybe mildly enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube 1.3 cm from the carina, recommend withdrawal by
 approximately 3 cm for appropriate positioning.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm may represent
 developing pneumonia or atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Right
 base atelectasis.
 
 Discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ emergency medicine by phone at the
 time of discovery on ___ at approximately 5:30 PM.
