                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with questionable right upper lobe opacity on
 chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  Right PICC has been retracted, and now
 terminates in the mid-to-lower SVC.  There is no significant pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Focal right upper lobe opacity is
 unchanged.  Rightward deviation of the trachea and elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm again suggests volume loss.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right upper lobe opacity with volume loss.  Please
 follow radiographically as patient's symptoms resolve;  if findings do not
 clear, chest CT should be ordered.
