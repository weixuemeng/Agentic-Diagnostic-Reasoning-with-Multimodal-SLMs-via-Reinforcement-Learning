                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 increased pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Blunting of
 the posterior costophrenic angles on the lateral view suggests trace pleural
 effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema and trace pleural effusions.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.
