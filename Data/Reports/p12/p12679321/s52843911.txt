                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm from the carina, this should be
 advanced for optimal placement.  An endotracheal tube terminates within the
 stomach.  A left approach PICC terminates within the distal SVC.  Multiple
 mediastinal clips are unchanged.
 
 A large left pleural effusion is new from the prior study causing near
 complete opacification of the left lung.  Minimal rightward mediastinal shift
 is likely exaggerated by rotation, suggesting significant associated left lung
 collapse.  The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm from the carina and should be
 advanced for optimal placement.
 2. New large left pleural effusion with significant associated left lung
 collapse.
