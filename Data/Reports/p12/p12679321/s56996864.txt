                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p lap convert to open ccy c/b retained stone s/p ERCP c/b
 post-ERCP pancreatitis, WOPN with spontaneous perforation s/p
 ex-lap/pancreatic debridement,washout ___  // Interval assesment
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large left and moderate right layering pleural effusions have increased
 compared with the prior study.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.  Endotracheal tube terminates 8 cm from the carina.  A left
 PICC terminates in the mid SVC, and a right IJ central venous catheter
 terminates in the distal SVC.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and
 outside of the field of view.  Multiple mediastinal clips are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in large left and moderate right layering pleural
 effusions.
 2. Unchanged positioning of support devices including an endotracheal tube 8
 cm from the carina, which should be advanced 3 cm for optimal placement.
