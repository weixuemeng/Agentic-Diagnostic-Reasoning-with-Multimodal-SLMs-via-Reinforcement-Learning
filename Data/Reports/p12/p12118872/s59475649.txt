                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post abdominal surgery now with tachycardia. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Engorged pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins is
 suggestive of volume overload versus cardiac decompensation.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 Right pectoral Port-A-Cath ends at the origin of the SVC.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Engorged pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins is suggestive of volume
 overload versus cardiac decompensation.
