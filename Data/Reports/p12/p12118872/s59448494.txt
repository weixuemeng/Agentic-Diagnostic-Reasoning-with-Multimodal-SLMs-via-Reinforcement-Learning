 Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position from the prior exam, tip ending
 probably in the right internal jugular vein origin.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Focal consolidation in the left lower lung with obscuration of the lateral
 aspect of the descending thoracic aorta new and most likely represents edema
 in the setting of cardiac decompensation, but could be underlying pneumonia. 
 The heart size is moderately enlarged, increased from ___.  Pulmonary
 vascular tree is engorged, and contributes to the wider mediastinum, new since
 ___.  Edema is new and moderate. Probable small left pleural effusion as
 well. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild biventricular heart failure and/or volume overload.  More conspicuous
 left lower lung consolidation is likely edema, but could reflect superimposed
 pneumonia. Recommend close follow-up radiograph after treatment for cardiac
 decompensation.
