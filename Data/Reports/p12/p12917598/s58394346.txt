                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Brain mass.  Evaluate for pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate chronic elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm, although, to a lesser degree than prior.  There is
 linear atelectasis noted at the right lung base.  There are new widespread
 reticulonodular opacities throughout both lungs.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  A large mass is
 again seen within the AP window and appears grossly unchanged.  The previously
 seen pulmonary nodules are too small to be appreciated on this study.  The
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. New, widespread reticulonodular opacities since ___ of uncertain
 chronicity. Differential diagnosis includes lymphangitic spread of neoplasm
 versus more acute processes such as edema, drug toxicity and atypical
 pneumonia. Consider HRCT for more complete characterization if warranted
 clinically.
 2. Persistent aorticopulmonary window mass.
 3. Right basilar atelectasis adjacent to a chronically elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.
