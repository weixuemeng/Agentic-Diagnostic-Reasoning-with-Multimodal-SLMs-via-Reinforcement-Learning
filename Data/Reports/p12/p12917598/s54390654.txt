                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 As compared to the prior study, the NG tube appears to be more distally
 located, most likely within the stomach portion of the hiatal hernia.  The
 rest of the findings are grossly unchanged.  Interval improvement in vascular
 congestion is demonstrated, currently with relatively clear lungs.
