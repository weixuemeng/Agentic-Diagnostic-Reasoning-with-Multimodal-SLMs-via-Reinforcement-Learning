                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with severe epigastric pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen a significant portion of large and small bowel within
 the right lower portion of the chest, compatible with patient's known history
 of Morgagni hernia.  A hiatal hernia is also present.  The extensive bowel gas
 within these herniated loops limits assessment for subtle free air.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The visualized lung portions
 show basal atelectasis, likely secondary to the herniated viscera.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Morgagni and hiatal hernias, but no acute cardiopulmonary
 process; limited assessment for subdiaphragmatic free air.
