                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, now with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are slightly better lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is probably within normal limits given the low
 lung volumes.  No definite vascular congestion.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles suggests bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at
 the bases.
