                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with prior exam from approximately five hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Post-cardiac surgery with right IJ converted to TLC, assess
 line position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are again noted.  The right IJ sheath has been removed and
 there is now a right IJ TLC with its tip at the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  Lung volumes are quite low, which limits the evaluation.  There is
 probable mild pulmonary edema, though overall there has been no significant
 change.  No large pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  There are likely small bilateral effusions,
 unchanged.  There are clips in the left axilla and left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right IJ TLC tip in the cavoatrial junction.  Pulmonary edema
 persists.  Evaluation limited due to low lung volumes.
