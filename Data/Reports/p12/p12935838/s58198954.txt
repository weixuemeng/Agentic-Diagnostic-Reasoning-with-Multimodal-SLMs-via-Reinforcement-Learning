 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pursed lip breathing, wheezing, history of CABG, mitral valve
 replacement, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The diameter of the pulmonary vessels continues to suggest mild fluid
 overload.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists, a stent is seen in unchanged
 position.  Clips in the left axilla, the sternal wires are of constant
 alignment.  Unchanged position of the left PICC line.  No pleural effusions
 seen on the frontal or the lateral radiograph.  Minimal atelectasis at both
 the left and right lung bases, but no evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
