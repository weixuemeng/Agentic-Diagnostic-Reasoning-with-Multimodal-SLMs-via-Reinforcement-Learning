                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is again enlarged but difficult to assess, owing to low lung volumes. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, more conspicuous on the right,
 and there is mild-to-moderate but worsening interstitial process compared to
 the prior study including indistinctness of pulmonary vessels.  The appearance
 is most consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
