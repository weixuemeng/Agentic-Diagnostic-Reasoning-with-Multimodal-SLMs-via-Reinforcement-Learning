 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post mitral valve repair, evaluation for pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  However, part of the pre-existing atelectasis has resolved.  There is,
 however, still mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, combined to bilateral basal
 areas of atelectasis as well as a mild left pleural effusion.  The alignment
 of the sternal wires and the position of the right internal jugular vein
 catheter are constant.
