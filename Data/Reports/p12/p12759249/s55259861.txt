                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with preop chest radiograph for lumbar
 surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 increased opacity at the retrocardiac lung base (spine sign) could be due to
 atelectasis, although a right base consolidation cannot be entirely excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Multiple
 surgical clips are seen overlying the right axilla and right lower hemithorax.
