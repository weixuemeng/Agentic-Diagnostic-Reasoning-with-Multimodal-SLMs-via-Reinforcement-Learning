                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:30 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  SMA stent.  Check ET tube position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 With the chin slightly flexed, ET tube position 23 mm from the carina is
 acceptable.  Lung volumes are low and combined with supine positioning to
 exaggerate mild mediastinal pulmonary vascular engorgement though there may be
 mild volume overload.  Heart size is top normal.  The stomach is appreciably
 distended with air and fluid, but there is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
