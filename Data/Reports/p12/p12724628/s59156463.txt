                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with subtotal gastrectomy, now with hypoxia.  Please
 assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT torso performed ___ and
 chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal and
 hilar contours.  Rounded opacity projecting over the right heart border likely
 represents combination of rounded atelectasis and prominent pericardial fat
 pad evident on the ___ CT.  Bibasilar atelectasis is evident. 
 Minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles likely due to small
 pleural effusions.  The sideport of the NGT is at the GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No overt pulmonary edema or evidence of
 pneumonia.
 2. NGT with sideport at GE junction.  Recommend advancing 3-4 cm.
