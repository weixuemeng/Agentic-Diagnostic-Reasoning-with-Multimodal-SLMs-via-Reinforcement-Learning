                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and history of pleural effusions
 with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been no substantial interval change in the appearance of the chest
 compared to the radiograph obtained 1 day earlier.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged, with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy better seen on
 the recent CT.  Hilar contours are also unchanged and remain enlarged
 compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  There is likely mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Small to moderate size right pleural effusion and small
 left pleural effusion are unchanged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis or infection.  Multiple nodular opacities in both lungs
 are re- demonstrated, but better seen on the previous CT. No pneumothorax is
 identified. There are mild to moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change compared to the radiograph from 1 day
 previously.  Small to moderate biilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left, with bibasilar opacities possibly reflecting atelectasis or
 infection.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Known pulmonary metastatic
 lesions are better assessed on the previous CTA as is the mediastinal and
 hilar lymphadenopathy.
