                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with subjective fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is focal opacity
 projecting at the right lung apex.  Associated volume loss is seen on the
 right.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta is
 somewhat tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical opacity with associated right-sided volume loss is
 most suggestive of a chronic process.  However, given lack of priors to
 document stability, additional imaging would be suggested and can be performed
 by chest CT unless older films become available.
