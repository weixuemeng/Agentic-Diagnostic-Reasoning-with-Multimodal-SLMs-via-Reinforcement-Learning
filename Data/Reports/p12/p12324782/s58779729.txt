                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, status post fall with right rib pain.
 Evaluate for pneumonia or obvious fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, with no consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax identified.  Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  No
 displaced right rib fractures are appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Note that a dedicated rib
 series with a radiopaque marker at the site of pain is more sensitive for rib
 fractures.
