                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote study from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is moderate unchanged unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  The main pulmonary artery and right hilum appear
 slightly prominent, probably due to mild enlargement of central pulmonary
 arteries, but without change.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted along the
 lower thoracic spine including prominent anterior osteophyte formation along
 the lower thoracic vertebral body, increased since the remote prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Mildly prominent central pulmonary
 arteries although without change.
