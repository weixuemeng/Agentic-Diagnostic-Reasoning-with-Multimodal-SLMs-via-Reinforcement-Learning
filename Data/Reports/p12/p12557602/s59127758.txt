                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG and chest tube removal, evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There is however a new moderate right pneumothorax along with new subcutaneous
 air in the neck and pectoral regions bilaterally.  There is no significant
 shift of the mediastinal structures at this time. Lucency is also noted under
 the left hemidiaphragm and may be representative of a subpulmonic portion of
 the pneumothorax. 
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, and bilateral chest tubes have
 since been removed.  A right IJ sheath appears in place with the tip at the
 junction of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins.  
 
 Post-surgical changes are again noted with intact CABG wires.  There is a
 small left pleural effusion; otherwise, the lungs are without focal
 consolidation. Cardiac silhouette appears stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate right pneumothorax with new bilateral air in the
 neck and chest subcutaneous tissues. While there is no significant shift of
 the midline structures at this time, close continued followup is recommended. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ via telephone at
 10:50 a.m. on ___.
