                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG with clamping of chest tube.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent from same day
 at 7:27.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right chest tube with the tip at the right base and a right internal jugular
 central venous catheter with tip in the upper SVC appear unchanged.  Median
 sternotomy wires appear intact and aligned.  Otherwise, there is little
 interval change in comparison to the prior study.  It is difficult to exclude
 tiny right basilar pneumothorax.  There is no shift of midline structures. 
 Postsurgical appearance of the heart appears stable.  Subcutaneous air is
 again noted in the right axilla and flank. Atelectatic changes are again noted
 at the left base.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little change in comparison to the prior study but tiny right basilar
 pneumothorax is no longer clearly identified.
