                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post chest tube placement,
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained two hours earlier during the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  During the latest examination interval, a new right-sided internal
 jugular approach central venous line has been placed, seen to terminate
 overlying the right-sided superior mediastinal structures at the level 2 cm
 above the carina.  This is compatible with the upper third of the SVC.  On the
 right base, the previously existing pigtail end catheter has been removed.  A
 chest tube has now been inserted through the right-sided lateral chest wall at
 the level of the sixth rib interval.  The chest tube makes a sharp kink in
 caudal direction to terminate in the posterior pleural sinus.  There is
 significant increase of local chest wall edema at the site of the chest tube
 entrance.  No new increased pleural effusion can be identified.  Small
 right-sided pneumothorax appears to be unchanged, but is rather difficult to
 assess because of the overlying tissue edema.  ___ was paged at 3:45
 p.m.
