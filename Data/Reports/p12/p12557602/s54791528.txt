 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post coronary bypass graft surgery with chest tube placement
 for post-operative pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A chest tube again projects over the right hemithorax.  There is a
 similar small quantity of associated subcutaneous emphysema along the right
 lateral chest wall and base of the neck.  There is apparently a trace right
 apical pneumothorax but not substantial noting an in situ chest tube.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Increased volume loss
 and retrocardiac opacification are noted in the left lower lobe with a new
 small possible pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very small suspected right apical pneumothorax.
