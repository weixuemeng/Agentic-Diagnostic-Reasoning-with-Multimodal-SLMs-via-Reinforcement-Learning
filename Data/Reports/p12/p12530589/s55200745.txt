 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post accident in 5 CAT today while moving
 snow.  Evaluate for left rib fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are somewhat
 low.  The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The imaged bony
 structures are intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  No definite displaced rib fractures.  If
 there is persistent clinical concern, a dedicated rib series may be performed
 to further assess.
