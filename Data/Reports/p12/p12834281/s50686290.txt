                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers, fatigue and dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes remain decreased but improved from the
 most recent prior study.  There is no significant pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax on this single frontal view.  Minimal patchy opacities projecting
 over the left mid lung field may represent atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Mild streaky opacification of the
 bilateral lung bases is most compatible with atelectasis on the left greater
 than the right.  Retrocardiac opacification corresponds to the patient's known
 large hiatal hernia.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Unchanged large
 hiatal hernia.
