 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a right PICC.  There is minimal
 right lower lung atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size
 is top normal, unchanged.  There is a moderate to large hiatal hernia, as
 before.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base, most consistent with
 atelectasis, although an early infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 Clinical correlation recommended.
 2.  Moderate to large hiatal hernia.
