                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD on 3 L nasal cannula at home.  Increased
 work of breathing.  Evaluate for pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest x-ray was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No consolidation or pulmonary edema is seen.  Continued elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged, consistent with previous left lower lobectomy. 
 Opacities at the left base are likely secondary to scarring.  Stable
 calcifications of the aortic knob continue to be seen, and post-thoracotomy
 bony changes are seen.  The left 6th rib is not seen posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary disease including pneumonia or fluid overload.
