                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The heart is normal in size.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a streaky left infrahilar
 opacity as well as more generalized reticulation and peribronchial cuffing in
 the right lower lung.  There is no prior chest radiograph with which to
 compare.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected interstitial abnormality in the right lower lung,
 possible developing pneumonia, atypical presentation of edema or atelectasis. 
 Depending on clinical circumstances it may be appropriate to consider
 short-term followup PA and lateral radiographs to reassess.
