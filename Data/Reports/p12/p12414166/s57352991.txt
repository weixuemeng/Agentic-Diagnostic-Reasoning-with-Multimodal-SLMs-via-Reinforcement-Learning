                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Increased interstitial markings are demonstrated diffusely,
 similar compared to the prior exam. More focal opacity within the right lung
 base is also noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no
 pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. More
 focal opacity in the right lung base may reflect an area of developing
 infection. Follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
