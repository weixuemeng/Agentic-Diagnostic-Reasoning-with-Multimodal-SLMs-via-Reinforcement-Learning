                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pulmonary contusions and right rib fracture.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  Diffuse opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe
 have increased in the left lower lobe.  This could be due to worsening
 atelectasis.  There is probably a small left effusion.  Small right effusion
 is unchanged.
