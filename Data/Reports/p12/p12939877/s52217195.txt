                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with rib fractures, evaluate rib
 fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 available portable AP single view chest examination of ___. 
 Previously described moderate cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary
 congestion has regressed.  Heart size is presently within normal limits. 
 There is moderate widening and elongation of the thoracic aorta, but no
 evidence for any local contour abnormality.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  With the exception of a thin plate atelectasis in the mid field of
 the right lung, there is no evidence of any remaining acute pulmonary
 infiltrate.  Thus the on previous CT identified pulmonary densities suggestive
 of contusion are not seen anymore.  Again noted are local rib fractures
 beginning with the posterior aspect of the right second rib and reaching to
 the posterior aspect of the eighth rib on the right side.  There are
 additional rib deformities in the lateral chest wall involving the lateral
 portions of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rib where there is some
 increased soft tissue density surrounding the non-displaced fractures
 indicating beginning callus formation.  There is no evidence of any
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion in lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of beginning rib fracture healings.  Regression of
 previously identified pulmonary contusion.  No new pulmonary abnormalities.
