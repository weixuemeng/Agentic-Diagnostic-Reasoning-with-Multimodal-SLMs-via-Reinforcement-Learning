                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD and PTX s/p endobronchial valves.  //
 eval PTX and valve placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed ETT tip is in standard position.  There has been interval
 placement of endobronchial valves which project over the right upper lobe and
 lower lobe bronchi.  2 pigtail catheters project over the right mid thorax,
 unchanged.  A small right apical pneumothorax overall unchanged.  The lungs
 are hyperexpanded with background hyperlucency and flattening the
 hemidiaphragms, consistent with emphysema.  Opacities in the right upper lobe
 are overall unchanged.  Left upper lobe increased interstitial markings in
 reflect chronic scarring.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small right apical pneumothorax status post right and endobronchial
 valve placement.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
