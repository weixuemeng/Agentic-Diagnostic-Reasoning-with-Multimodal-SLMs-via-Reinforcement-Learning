                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man h/o spont R PTX, S/P EBV placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to exam on ___ at 14:14, there is no significant change.
 Lungs are hyperinflated because of extremely severe emphysema, particularly
 large biapical bullae.  Small right pneumothorax, if any, has not changed,
 though the assessment is unreliable in setting of bullous emphysema.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic sulcus and basal opacity likely reflect pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  The left lung appears unchanged from prior with
 scarring and atelectasis at the apex.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema or pulmonary consolidation.  Pigtail catheter is in place,
 unchanged in position.  Valves are seen at the right hilum, unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged appearance of bilateral emphysematous lungs.  Possible small
 right pneumothorax, unchanged.
 2. Small right pleural effusion and atelectasis, unchanged.
