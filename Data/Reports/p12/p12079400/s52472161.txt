                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spont ___ transferred from OSH  // Right
 side PTX and Pigtail position      Right side PTX and Pigtail position
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is indeed moderate right pneumothorax, despite the right pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter.  Lateral view is recommended to exclude fissural placement
 of the catheter.  Patient has extremely severe bullous emphysema.  Radiographs
 earlier in this illness should be evaluated to see if pneumothorax preceded
 placement of the drain.
 
 The generalized increase in left perihilar interstitial abnormality could be
 due to redirection of blood flow contributing to borderline edema.  Right
 pleural effusion is minimal.  Heart size is normal.
