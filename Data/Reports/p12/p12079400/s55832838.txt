                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumothorax.  Evaluate after changing chest
 tube to waterseal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to baseline chest radiograph
 ___ and ___:
 
 Emphysema and scarring are so severe that it is difficult to say whether
 pneumothorax is entirely resolved.  The walls of giant bullae mimic a pleural
 edge, and it is possible that adhesions developing in the pleural space could,
 in turn mimic the walls of bullae.  My best judgment, however, is that there
 is no appreciable residual pneumothorax.  If there were, there would be a
 fluid level with respect to the small right pleural effusion.  The fluid level
 one can see on the current lateral view is in the stomach.
 
 Spontaneous pneumothorax even in patients with severe emphysema is relatively
 rare and raises concern for predisposing conditions such as a subpleural
 malignancy.  At some point, it would be prudent to perform a chest CT looking
 for malignancy, and it might be necessary to do a chest CT to exclude
 pneumothorax.
