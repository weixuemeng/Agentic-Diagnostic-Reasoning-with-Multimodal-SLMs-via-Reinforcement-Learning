                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new chest tube placed  // CT and pigtail in
 place, both suction. PTX?      CT and pigtail in place, both suction. PTX?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___:58.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indwelling right pigtail pleural drainage catheter has been withdrawn to the
 lateral aspect of the right hemi thorax and a second pigtail drainage catheter
 has been placed in the vicinity.  Right pneumothorax is substantially smaller,
 but precise determination is difficult because of severe paraseptal emphysema.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema persists.  Greater opacification at the left apex will
 need to be followed to exclude concurrent pneumonia.  Heart size is normal. 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
