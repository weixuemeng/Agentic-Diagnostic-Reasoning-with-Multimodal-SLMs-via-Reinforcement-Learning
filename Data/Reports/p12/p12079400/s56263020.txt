                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p EBV placement for R PTX  // check interval
 change with CTs on suction
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two right pigtail catheters are in place.  Pneumothorax has decreased with
 small residual right apical pneumothorax.  There is a background of severe
 emphysema with large apical bulla bilaterally.  Again there is blunting of the
 right costophrenic sulcus likely reflecting some combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Overall appearance of the left lung is stable. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval decrease in size of right pneumothorax with residual small apical
 pneumothorax.
 2. Small right pleural effusion is increased.
