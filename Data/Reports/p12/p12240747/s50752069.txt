                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-sized right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in
 size since the recent chest radiograph, and a small to moderate left pleural
 effusion is similar to the prior exam.  Cardiomediastinal contour similar
 allowing for differences in positioning between the exams.  Persistent
 bilateral lower lobe retrocardiac opacities, most likely due to atelectasis in
 the setting of bilateral effusions.
