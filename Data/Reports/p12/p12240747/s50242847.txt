                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, ultrasound-guided thoracocentesis,
 evaluation for the resolution of the effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  The effusion on the right has substantially decreased
 in extent but is still visible at the lung bases.  On the left, pre-existing
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion has slightly increased in extent.  At both
 lung bases there are areas of atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly that is
 unchanged.  The previously malpositioned right PICC line has been
 re-positioned.  The tip projects over the lower SVC.  There is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
