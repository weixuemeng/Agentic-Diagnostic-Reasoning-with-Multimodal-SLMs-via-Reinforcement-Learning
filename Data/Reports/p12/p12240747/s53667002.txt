                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post recent surgery, now presenting with
 tachycardia and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Moderate right and small left bilateral pleural effusions persist,
 although right pleural effusion appears decreased in extent..  There is also
 likely a component of bibasilar atelectasis.  Underlying infection in these
 locations cannot be ruled out.  The remainder of the lungs bilaterally is
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. 
 The cardiac size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with associated
 atelectasis.  Underlying infection in the lower lobes cannot be excluded.
