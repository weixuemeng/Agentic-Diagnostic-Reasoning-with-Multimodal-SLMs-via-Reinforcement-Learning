                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF and leg swelling and altered mental status, question
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are low lung volumes
 which exaggerate the prominence of the vascular structures as well as heart
 size.  Given the low lung volumes, edema or consolidation cannot be ruled out.
 Pacemaker leads are in stable position.  There are aortic knob calcifications.
 There is no pleural effusion identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  PICC line
 ends in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes obscure the study and edema or pneumonia cannot
 be entirely ruled out.  The left lung is slightly obscured from overlying
 hardware.
