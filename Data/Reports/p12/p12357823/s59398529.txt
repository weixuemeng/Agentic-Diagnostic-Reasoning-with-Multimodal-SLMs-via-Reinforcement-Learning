                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p intubation after motor vehicle trauma from
 the prior day.  Evaluate endotracheal tube and OG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.9 cm above the carina comment should
 not be withdrawn any further.  The OG tube tip terminates in the left upper
 quadrant in the region of the stomach.  A right-sided mid line is present.
 
 Patient is post CABG, denoted by intact median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal surgical clips.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities likely reflect atelectasis and/or
 scarring, as seen on the recent torso CT.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Known fracture through the superior aspect of the T7 vertebral body is better
 evaluated on the CT torso from the prior day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.9 cm above the carina and should not be
 withdrawn any further.
 
 2.  OG tube tip terminates in the region of the stomach.
 
 3.  Persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities, likely due to atelectasis and/
 or scarring.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
