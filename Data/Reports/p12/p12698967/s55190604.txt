                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with mechanical fall vs syncope and new onset of
 weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA head and neck ___ at 10:38, CT chest ___,
 chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  Triangular opacity within the
 right upper lobe measuring approximately 12 mm is more apparent than on the
 prior chest radiograph from ___, but was seen in ___. 
 Tree-in-___ nodular opacities seen in the right upper lobe on the recent CTA
 head and neck likely reflect small airways disease, but is not well assessed
 on the current radiograph.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may be due to
 chronic pleural thickening versus a trace pleural effusion.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.  Multiple compression fractures within
 the mid and lower thoracic spine as well as the upper lumbar spine appear
 grossly unchanged.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are also re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the most recent chest radiograph.  Small
 airways disease seen in the right upper lobe on recent CTA head and neck is
 not well assessed on the current radiograph.  Right upper lobe 12 mm
 triangular opacity is grossly unchanged from ___, but should be
 further assessed with dedicated chest CT.
