                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Persistent nausea, vomiting and headache.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Each hilum shows an engorged appearance with upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vascularity and a central interstitial
 abnormality, worse than on the prior study and suggestive of mild-to-moderate
 vascular congestion.  The lateral view shows a small pleural effusion on the
 right and also patchy posterior opacification in the left lower lobe, probably
 due to a combination of parenchymal opacity and pleural effusion.  This
 appearance is accompanied by increased volume loss with new elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm, which may imply atelectasis.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Small suspected bilateral pleural effusions and patchy dependent opacity
 in the left lower lobe with volume loss.  Although pneumonia is hard to
 completely exclude, this appearance could likely be explained by atelectasis.
