                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CVA and left hemipelvis with
 worsening lower extremity edema and chronic lower extremity pain, assess for
 signs of fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions which are small and not significantly changed from
 the prior exam.  Mild interstitial prominence is most conspicuous from prior
 exam though its persistence reflects the presence of interstitial edema.  No
 pneumothorax or definite signs of pneumonia.  The heart and mediastinal
 contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions are stable with possible mild
 interstitial edema.
