                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is an increasing posterior basilar
 opacity, probably on the left and suggesting a consolidation with a pleural
 effusion, perhaps loculated.  Although a diffuse generalized interstitial
 abnormality appears similar to slightly increased suggesting mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion, a more focal new left infrahilar opacity is
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no free air.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left lung opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  There may
 be a coinciding pleural effusion, potentially loculated.  Background
 interstitial abnormality appears similar-to-mildly increased, suggesting
 coinciding vascular congestion.
