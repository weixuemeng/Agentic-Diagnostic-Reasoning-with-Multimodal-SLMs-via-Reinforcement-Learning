                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with reexplored patient for bleeding after
 mediastinoscopy, please evaluate for mediastinal hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval development of marked mediastinal widening
 consistent with clinical history of hematoma.  Previously noted mediastinal
 gas is no longer seen. The cardiac silhouette remains normal in size.  There
 is no large pleural effusion.  Bilateral infrahilar opacity is new and may
 reflect atelectasis, or aspiration.  A right hilar mass is again noted.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Marked interval mediastinal widening, consistent with hematoma.
 
 2.  Bilateral infrahilar airspace opacity, atelectasis versus aspiration.
 
 3.  Right hilar mass, unchanged.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3pm by phone.
