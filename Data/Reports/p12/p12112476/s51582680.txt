                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with stage III non-small cell lung cancer on
 chemotherapy with lethargy and vomiting.  Low blood pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Volume loss in the right hemithorax is
 seen with streaky right midlung and perihilar opacity with rightward shift of
 the mediastinum.  These findings are presumably in part due to treatment for
 patient's known cancer however underlying mass is also possible.  There is no
 prior to evaluate for interval change.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax on either side.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right sided volume loss and streaky right midlung and perihilar opacity likely
 in part due to treatment for patient's known cancer however underlying mass
 cannot be adequately assessed.  There is no prior to evaluate for interval
 change.  No pneumothorax.
