                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 921
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right lower lobectomy, now with chest tube
 removal, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 921 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be some resolving subcutaneous emphysema within the
 soft tissues of the lateral chest wall.  There is a moderate right-sided
 effusion with opacity at the right mid and lower lung, which likely represents
 compressive atelectasis, although infection cannot be entirely excluded.  The
 left lung remains grossly clear.  Stable pleural thickening along the right
 lateral chest wall.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient
 positioning.
