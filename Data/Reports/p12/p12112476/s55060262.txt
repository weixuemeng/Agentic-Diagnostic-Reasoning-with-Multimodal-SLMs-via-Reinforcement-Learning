                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:57.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right lower lobectomy, evaluate
 chest tube status.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:00
 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 10:57, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the right chest tube with residual subcutaneous emphysema
 in the right lateral chest wall soft tissues.  There is a moderate right-sided
 effusion with some opacity at the right mid to lower lung which may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although an infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded.  The left lung is grossly clear, although diminished in volume.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on
 the current examination.
