                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M hx of right lung nodule, CLL, PAF, COPD and EtOH abuse s/p
 right upper lobectomy on ___, admitted to SICU for hypoxic respiratory
 distress on the floor requiring non-rebreather mask. Recovery c/b EtOH
 withdrawal and hallucinations  // follow up
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___ p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Tracheostomy is in place.  Right IJ line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax detected.  Multiple lines overlie the chest.  Of note, the
 previously seen left-sided PICC line is not visualized on the current study.
 
 Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 are low inspiratory volumes and prominent bilateral opacities in both lungs,
 with relative sparing of the right mid/upper zone.  There is prominent fluid
 and/or pleural thickening at the right apex, unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is partially obscured by the pulmonary opacities, but not clearly
 changed.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change in cardiomediastinal silhouette are diffuse bilateral
 opacities.
 
 Previously seen left PICC line not visualized on this examination.  Clinical
 correlation is requested.
