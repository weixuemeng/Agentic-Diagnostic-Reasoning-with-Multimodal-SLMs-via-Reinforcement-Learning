 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 11:12 AM
  1.  Nasogastric tube properly positioned within the stomach.
  2.  Worsening left lung atelectasis causing volume loss.
  3.  Stable mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
  4.  The endotracheal tube could be advanced 1.5 cm for optimal positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NG tube position in patient with perforated diverticulitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ back to
 ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The tip and sideport of the
 nasogastric tube terminate within the stomach.  An endotracheal tube is in
 unchanged position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  A left central
 venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 Atelectasis of the left lung is slightly worse, causing volume loss and
 subsequent leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  The low lung volumes are
 causing crowding pulmonary vasculature.  The small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
