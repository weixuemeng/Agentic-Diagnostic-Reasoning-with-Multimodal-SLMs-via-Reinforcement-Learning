 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  If any, there are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Bibasilar atelectases, larger
 on the right side, have increased.  Cardiac size is top normal, is accentuated
 by the low lung volumes.  Right upper lobe opacity could be due to
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
