 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest was compared with
 prior chest radiographs through ___, with the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.4 cm above the carina with the
 patient's neck in neutral position and is appropriate.  Subclavian line ends
 at lower SVC.  The orogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach, but its
 distal end is beyond the radiographic view.  Since ___,
 bilateral lower lung atelectasis, left side more than right side, is
 unchanged.  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Pleural effusion, if any, is
 minimal bilaterally and similar.
