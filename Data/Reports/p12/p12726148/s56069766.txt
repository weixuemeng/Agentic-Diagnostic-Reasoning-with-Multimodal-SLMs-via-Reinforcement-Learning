                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with perforated diverticulitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube passes
 into the stomach.  There is a right IJ central line as well as a left
 subclavian central line, both of which extend to the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right. 
 This likely accounts for worsened basilar opacities.  Additional ill-defined
 perihilar opacities are suggestive of slight progressive worsening of
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is progressively enlarged compared to prior
 studies.  Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is most compatible with
 significant volume loss. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Continued progressive worsening of volume status, with increased cardiomegaly,
 bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema. 
 
 Dense retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects volume loss.
