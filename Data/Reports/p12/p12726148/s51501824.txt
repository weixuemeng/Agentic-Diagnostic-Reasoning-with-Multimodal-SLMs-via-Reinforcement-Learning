                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with resolving sepsis.  Evaluate for fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the
 carina, positioned above the level of the clavicular heads.  Nasogastric tube
 passes into the stomach, tip not well seen due to underpenetration.  There is
 a left subclavian central line, which extends to the upper SVC.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is resultant basal atelectasis and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Heart size is stable.  There is a left pleural
 effusion layering posteriorly and causing diffuse increased opacity of the
 left hemithorax.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, with
 perihilar haziness compatible with pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes, vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema
 little changed compared to one day prior.
 2.  Left pleural effusion, now latering dependently.
 3.  Slightly high positioning of the endotracheal tube, which could be
 slightly advanced for optimal positioning.
