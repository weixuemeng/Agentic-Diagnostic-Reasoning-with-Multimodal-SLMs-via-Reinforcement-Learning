                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion has improved.  The monitoring and support devices remain in place. 
 Continued low lung volumes.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region suggest
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Superimposed
 pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.  There is also some opacification at
 the right base consistent with atelectasis, though an infectious focus again
 cannot be ruled out.
