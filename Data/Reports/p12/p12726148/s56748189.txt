                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old female with perforated diverticulitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina, above the level of the
 clavicular heads.  Nasogastric gastric tube passes into the stomach and off
 the inferior margin of the film.  There is a left subclavian line extending to
 the mid SVC.  The lung volumes are low. There is decreased lucency of the
 lungs bilaterally, which likely reflects in large part increased layering
 effusions, though increased pulmonary edema is also likely present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There is no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increased opacity at the lungs, most likely reflecting
 increased effusions, left greater than right, also likely worsened pulmonary
 edema.  No definite pneumonia.
