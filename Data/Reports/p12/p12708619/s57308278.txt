                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with known bilateral ___ transferred from OSH for
 large SAH, now s/p EVD placement and coiling/embolization of aneurysm with no
 change in neuro exam w/ persistent fevers  // interval change    interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The overlying ED board greatly obscures detail. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels that could represent elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 The hemidiaphragms are not partially obscured with hazy opacification at the
 left base.  This suggests layering pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis.
 In view of the bilateral pulmonary changes and limitations due to the ED
 board, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
