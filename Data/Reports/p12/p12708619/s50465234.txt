                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p intubated  // eval for tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. 
 Dual lead left-sided pacer device is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema.  Patchy right base opacity may be due to
 combination of atelectasis fluid overload however, aspiration or infection are
 also in the differential diagnosis.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Left greater than right biapical pleural thickening is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Patchy right base opacity could be due to
 combination of pulmonary edema in atelectasis however, aspiration or infection
 are also in the differential diagnosis.
