                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base are likely
 secondary to atelectasis, although early infection in this region cannot be
 excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion without frank interstitial edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is noted. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Streaky right lower lung opacities, likely atelectasis, although early
 infection in this region cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation
 recommended.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
