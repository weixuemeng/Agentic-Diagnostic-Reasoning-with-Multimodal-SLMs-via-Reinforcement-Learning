 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, pain over the left chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is
 noted.  In particular, there is no evidence of vertebral compression
 fractures, rib lesions, or pneumothorax.  In case of persisting clinical
 complaints, dedicated rib series may be considered as a further evaluation
 step.
 
 The pacemaker leads are intact.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
