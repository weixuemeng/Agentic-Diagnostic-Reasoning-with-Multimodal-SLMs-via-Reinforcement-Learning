 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Paramediastinal opacities are compatible with radiation
 fibrosis.  Hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal
 consolidation.  Biapical scarring with pleural calcifications are also noted,
 more pronounced on the right.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Multiple clips project over the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Post radiation fibrosis
 accounting for the paramediastinal opacities.  Chronic scarring in the lung
 apices.
