                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Increased retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis, but is compatible with infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right
 PICC terminates in the upper SVC.  Left humeral head screws are in stable
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis but could
 represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
