                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:50 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man after catheterization with metastatic prostate
 cancer and new shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of any recent chest imaging:
 
 Heart size is normal and pulmonary vasculature unremarkable.  Greater
 opacification at the lung bases, particularly right, could be atelectasis
 alone, or aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion is also present.  Followup
 recommended with conventional chest radiographs when feasible.
