                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ischemic CMP s/p CABG complaining of new CP
 and SOB.  // eval for PNA, effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, persistent pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by slight improvement in extent of interstitial
 edema.  Moderate left and small to moderate right pleural effusions appear
 slightly larger, but positional differences may potentially contribute to this
 apparent change.  No other relevant changes since recent study.
