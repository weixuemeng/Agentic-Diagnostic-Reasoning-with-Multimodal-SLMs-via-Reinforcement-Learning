                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough and question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.  Please note that comparison
 to old films can be helpful to assess for interval change.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is prominent interstitium with more focal
 linear opacities in the right middle lobe and at the left base which may
 reflect scarring, small airways disease or underlying bronchiectasis.  Early
 pneumonia can not be excluded.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral interstitial prominence with more focal linear opacities involving
 the RML and LLL.  This raises the possibility of small airways disease. Early
 pneumonia can not be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.
