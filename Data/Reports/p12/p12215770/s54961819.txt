                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of asthma and Churg-___
 vasculitis, now has a persistent cough, with dyspnea, fatigue, and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased, but heart size is normal and
 there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is the suggestion of a
 small lesion in the right lung projecting over the anterior aspect of the
 fourth rib.  Previous consolidation at the medial aspect of the right lung
 base has similar appearance on the frontal view, but is much improved on the
 lateral.  Lateral shows a new small region of consolidation in the middle lobe
 or lingula.
 
 Findings altogether suggest either minimal infection or return of vasculitis. 
 If symptoms persist, I would suggest a chest CT scan, which can be compared
 with ___
