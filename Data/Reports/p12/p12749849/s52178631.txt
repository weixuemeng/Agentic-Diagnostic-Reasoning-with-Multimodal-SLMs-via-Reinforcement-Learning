                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead pacer
 is unchanged with proximal lead in the expected location of the right atrium
 and distal lead in the expected location of the right ventricle.  No focal
 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild vascular
 redistribution which is likely suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No frank pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
