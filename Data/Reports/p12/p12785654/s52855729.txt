 AP CHEST, 5:31 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with increasing oxygen requirement.  Possible
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Heart size top normal, pulmonary vasculature minimally congested.  Mild
 peribronchial opacification right lower lobe.  Findings most likely due to
 mild atelectasis.  No good evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Pleural
 effusion minimal on the left if any.  No pneumothorax.  Catheter projecting
 over the midline has the appearance of an epidural infusion catheter, but I
 cannot be sure what it is.
