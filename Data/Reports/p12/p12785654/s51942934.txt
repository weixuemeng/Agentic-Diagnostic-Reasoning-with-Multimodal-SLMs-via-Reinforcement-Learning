                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 11:34 from outside
 institution, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  Mediastinal contours remain unchanged
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Subsegmental atelectasis versus scarring is again noted within the
 right middle lobe and lingula, unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with
 underlying mild emphysema.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are visualized. 
 Compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  Mild to
 moderate multilevel degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Subsegmental atelectasis versus
 scarring within the lingula and right middle lobe, unchanged.  Mild emphysema.
