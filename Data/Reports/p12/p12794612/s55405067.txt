                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 similar moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Streaky
 opacities are present in the left lower lung, but mostly the lungs are much
 better aerated and this finding could be seen with patchy associated
 atelectasis.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung opacity, although more suggestive of atelectasis
 or scarring in the presence of an elevated hemidiaphragm than pneumonia.  The
 possibility of an infectious cause is not entirely excluded, however.
