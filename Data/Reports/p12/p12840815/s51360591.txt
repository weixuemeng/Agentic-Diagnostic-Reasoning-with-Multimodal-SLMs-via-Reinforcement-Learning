                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LLL basal segmentectomy  // check interval
 change      check interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___:50 and 17:35.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall volume of the moderate left hydro pneumothorax is unchanged, but the
 fluid component has increased, best appreciated on the lateral view.
 The unusual round abnormality in the left lung that developed after left chest
 surgery is no longer apparent, probably smaller, and therefore probably
 resolved atelectasis.
 Right lung is hyperinflated, due to emphysema, but clear and small right
 pleural effusion has decreased.  Heart is normal size.  Leftward mediastinal
 shift reflects greater volume loss in the left lung than displacement by the
 hydro pneumothorax.  Moderately extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left
 chest wall is unchanged.
