                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with confusion, headache, difficulty walking.
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are diffusely increased interstitial
 markings seen throughout the lungs but no confluent consolidation.  Blunting
 of the posterior costophrenic angle suggests small effusion, potentially on
 the left.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is upper normal limits.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially from chronic
 lung disease vs mild interstitial edema.
