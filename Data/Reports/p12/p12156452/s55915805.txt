                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p high grade sbo intubated  // eval for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent from ___. 
 Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are stable with moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly.  Dilated mediastinal vessels are chronic in appearance.  Left
 lower lobe consolidation is a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion,
 although infection is not excluded.  A small right pleural effusion is likely,
 and right basilar consolidation, reflecting atelectasis or pneumonia, is
 increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  ETT is in standard position.  Enteric
 tube is seen coursing towards the stomach with distal tip not captured on the
 current study.  Internal jugular line is present with tip terminating in the
 mid to low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increase in right basilar consolidation, which may reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia, with a small right pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable appearance of the left base, with consolidation and small left
 pleural effusion.
