                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, CT abdomen and pelvis
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates no focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia.  Compared to prior study dated ___, overall
 appearance of the chest is not significantly changed.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable, the heart appears mildly enlarged.  Prominence of
 the mediastinum is stable. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely
 secondary to pleural thickening.  Streaky atelectasis is seen in the left lung
 base with unchanged mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  No focal
 consolidation is present.  No large pleural effusion, pneumothorax or evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.
