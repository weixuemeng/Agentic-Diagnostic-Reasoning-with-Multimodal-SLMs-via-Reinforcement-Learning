                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right internal jugular central line placement
 and status post 6L NS
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the SVC/right
 atrial junction.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 top normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities
 are noted in the lung bases, more pronounced in the left lung base,
 potentially atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 There may be a tiny left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the junction of the
 SVC and right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and patchy
 opacities at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration
 particularly in the left lung base cannot be completely excluded.
