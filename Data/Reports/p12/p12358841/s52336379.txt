 There is increased opacity projecting over the right lower chest. Some of this
 is soft tissue due to the position of the breast. An underlying infectious
 infiltrate can't be totally excluded. There is a small right pleural effusion
 that is slightly increased compared to prior. The right central line is been
 removed.  The NG tube is been removed. The left lung is clear

 Small right pleural effusion. The opacity projecting over the right chest is
 felt to be soft tissue in etiology. If further delineation is desired a repeat
 study with the patient more upright and with a lateral view would be helpful
