                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes. 
 Unusual tubulated shape of the upper mediastinum and azygos enlargement are
 unchanged since ___. The diminutive inferior vena caval contour on the
 lateral view is an indication that the mediastinal appearance is due to venous
 anomalies such as hepatic interruption of the inferior vena cava, of no
 clinical significance.
 However there is also a lateral bulge in the margin of the descending thoracic
 aorta, that is larger today.  That could also be unimportant, such as dilated
 accessory hemiazygos vein or even hiatus hernia.  I discussed the lesser
 possibility of aortic pathology with Dr ___,  ___ the appropriate use of
 CTA in the workup of this patient's chest pain at 8am.
 
 No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.    Heart size is
 normal.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 See discussion of mediastinal abnormalities above.
