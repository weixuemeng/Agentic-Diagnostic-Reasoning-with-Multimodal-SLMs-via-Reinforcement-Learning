                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and palpitations.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumothorax or aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated and clear.  Mild vasculature
 engorgement is not very different than before, and apparent mild cardiomegaly
 could be due to differences in projection.  Nevertheless cardiac evaluation
 would be reasonable; these findings neither suggest nor exclude pulmonary
 embolism.  Bulges in the contours of descending thoracic aorta and azygos vein
 are due to dilated veins in patient with the anatomic variant hepatic
 interruption of the IVC.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 See Findings, above.
