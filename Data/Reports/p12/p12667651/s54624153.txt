                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis, wheezing on exam, concern
 for pneumonia  // Evidence of pneumonia      Evidence of pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 The upper paramedian chest has a very abnormal appearance, suggesting either a
 very large esophageal hernia or prior esophagectomy and gastric pull-up
 surgery or hilar or lung masses, mucoid impactions or fissural pleural fluid
 loculations.  Unfortunately the explanation is not clarified by the lateral
 view and CT scanning is recommended if the accurate clinical history is not
 known.
 
 Thickening of the left lateral costal pleural margin and deformity of the
 adjacent ribs suggest prior trauma, perhaps recent.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged.  I do not see pneumonia or pulmonary edema and pleural effusion if
 any is small.  No pneumothorax.  Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
