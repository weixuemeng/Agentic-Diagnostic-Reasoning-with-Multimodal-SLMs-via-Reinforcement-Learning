                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVC acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Lordotic positioning and underpenetration on the AP view.  There is prominence
 of the right heart border -- this could reflect mild right-sided cardiomegaly,
 but is likely accentuated by technique.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion
 is detected.  No pneumothorax or free air beneath the diaphragm identified. 
 Limited assessment of osseous structures shows mild  thoracic spine DJD
 degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Possible cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
