                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and rales on exam.  Evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 8:14.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to radiograph for 24 hours prior, there is no
 significant interval change.  Again seen is the right IJ catheter terminating
 in the mid SVC (deflection to the right suggests goiter).  There is no
 cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement, or large pleural effusion.  Mild
 atelectatic changes at the left lung base are only partially imaged.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pulmonary edema.
