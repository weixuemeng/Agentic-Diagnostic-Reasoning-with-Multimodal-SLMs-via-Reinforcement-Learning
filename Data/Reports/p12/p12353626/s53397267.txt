                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bradycardia and complete heart block  //
 evaluation
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning, which considerably distorts in limits assessment of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Allowing for this, there are sternotomy wires
 and a prosthetic valve, mid probable prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Possible prominence of the left pulmonary artery.
 
 Possible background COPD.  There is mild vascular plethora.
 
 There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A small effusion would be difficult to exclude.  Possible
 minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle.  Atelectasis at the right
 base cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Sternotomy wires, with prosthetic valve.  Allowing for significant rotation, I
 suspect there is enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 Probable background COPD.
 
 Probable mild CHF.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and possible small effusions.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, changes at the left base could include a pneumonic
 infiltrate.
