                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  As on the study of ___, there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with a large hiatal hernia.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at
 the bases, without frank pulmonary edema.
 
 Severe compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine are again seen and
 there is a healed rib fracture in the left mid zone.
 
 In the retrocardiac region on the frontal view, there is some increased
 opacification that raises the possibility of supervening pneumonia.  This is
 not definitely confirmed on the lateral view.
