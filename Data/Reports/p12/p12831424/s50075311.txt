  1. Increased opacity projecting over the left lung base laterally without
  correlate on the lateral view.  This could potentially be due to overlying
  soft tissues although underlying parenchymal opacity is possible, noting no
  correlate to confirm on the lateral view.  Consider repeat exam with greater
  inspiratory effort for further characterization.
  2. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
  pulmonary edema.

  pleural effusion.
  2. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
  pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a recent fall and low oxygen saturation,
 no evidence of chest wall trauma on exam, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, reflective of moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly.  Known hiatal hernia is not as clearly seen on today's exam. 
 There are low lung volumes.  When compared to the prior, there is increased
 opacity projecting over the left lung base on the frontal view.  There is no
 clear correlate on the lateral view.  The right lung is clear.  There is
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Lower thoracic and upper lumbar compression
 deformities are similar compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacity projecting over the left lung base laterally without
 correlate on the lateral view.  This could potentially be due to overlying
 soft tissues although underlying parenchymal opacity is possible, noting no
 correlate to confirm on the lateral view.  Consider repeat exam with greater
 inspiratory effort for further characterization.
 2. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.
