                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears
 mild to moderately enlarged. A moderate size hiatal hernia is again
 demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar, with crowding of
 bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, with no focal
 consolidation identified. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 Compression deformities of several vertebral bodies at the thoracolumbar
 junction remain unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. Moderate size hiatal hernia.
