                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation on the AP view.  Low lung
 volumes are present which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which
 is likely mildly enlarged.  A moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacities in
 both lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Remote left-sided rib
 fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Moderate size hiatal hernia.
