                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with reduced O2 sat. Previous study with poor effort  //
 characterization for consolidation. Emphasize respiratory effort
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 307 p.m..  And portable film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Apparent increased opacity at the lateral aspect of the left lung base is less
 apparent on the current exam and is likely due to overlying soft tissues in
 combination with prominent pericardial fat which obscures the left
 costophrenic angle.  The appearance has not dramatically changed since prior
 portable film from ___.  Old thoracolumbar compression deformities again seen
 as well as a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process, no focal consolidation worrisome for
 infection.
