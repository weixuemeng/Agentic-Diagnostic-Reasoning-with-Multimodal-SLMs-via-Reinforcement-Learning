                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitation.  Assess for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS: Single frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates heterogeneous
 opacity within the right middle lobe with elevation of the right hemidiaphram
 consistent with right middle lobe atelectasis with crowding of vasculature. No
 additional focal opacities.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion. 
 Bilateral right greater than left hyperdense line along bilateral apices are
 consistent with bilateral pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Right middle lobe atelectasis with crowding of vasculature, this
 may present early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
