                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain s/p cardiac catheterization today
 // Pneumothorax?      Pneumothorax?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY OF ___, THERE IS AGAIN ENLARGEMENT OF
 THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE WITH EVIDENCE OF ELEVATED PULMONARY VENOUS PRESSURE.
 PROBABLE BIBASILAR ATELECTATIC CHANGE. HOWEVER, IN THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL
 SETTING, MORE COALESCENT OPACIFICATION AT THE RIGHT BASE COULD REPRESENT A
 DEVELOPING CONSOLIDATION.
 SINGLE PACER LEAD AGAIN EXTENDS TO THE REGION OF THE APEX OF THE RIGHT
 VENTRICLE.
