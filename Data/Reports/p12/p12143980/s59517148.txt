                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMH significant for T2DM, HTN, ischemic
 cardiomyopathy, and CAD s/p MI x2 and PCTA x2 with stent placement in ___,
 LAD stent in ___, with 2 recent BMS in ___, and recent admission to CCU
 ___ for STEMI s/p 2 DES to RCA presenting from ___ for CHF
 exacerbation. Current leukocytosis and chronic cough.  // Evidence of
 infectious process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On today's exam, inspiratory volumes may be slightly low, but there is
 background hyperinflation. There is moderate cardiomegaly the pulmonary hila
 are grossly unchanged. There is slight upper zone redistribution similar to
 the prior film, without other evidence of CHF. On today's film, the left
 hemidiaphragm is well defined and there is no increased opacity at the left
 base. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a
 small pleural effusion. Incidental note is made of an incomplete azygos
 fissure.
 
 Again seen is a single E left-sided pacemaker with lead tip over the right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, without other evidence
 of CHF.
 2. The left base is now seen to be clear, without significant collapse and
 without consolidation.
 3. Small right effusion.
 4. Pacemaker noted.
