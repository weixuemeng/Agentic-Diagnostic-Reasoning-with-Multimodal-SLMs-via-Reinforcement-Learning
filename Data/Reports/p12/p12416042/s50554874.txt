                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-AVR and CABG following tube removal, assess for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of mediastinal drains and left basal chest tube
 no left-sided pneumothorax is seen.  Small right-sided pneumothorax persists. 
 Lungs are otherwise well aerated aside from bibasilar atelectasis.  Right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
