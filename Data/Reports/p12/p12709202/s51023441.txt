                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever, assess for acute infectious
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is seen with diffuse alveolar
 opacities compatible with moderate pulmonary edema as seen on the recent
 prior.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with resultant atelectasis is
 seen.  Given the retrocardiac consolidation, followup imaging after diuresis
 is recommended to exclude underlying infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 Left pleural effusion with adjacent parenchymal opacity, likely atelectasis
 but pneumonia is not excluded.  Follow up CXR may be helpful in this regard.
