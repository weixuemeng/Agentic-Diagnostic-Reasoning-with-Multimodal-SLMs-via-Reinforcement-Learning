                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal with the heart size within normal
 limits.  Volume loss within the right upper lobe with slight elevation of the
 minor fissure and persistent but somewhat improved linear appearing
 opacification in the right upper lobe are noted, suggestive of improving
 infection.  Left lung is clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and the
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent volume loss in the right upper lobe with slightly decreased right
 upper lobe opacity suggestive of improving infection.  No new focal
 consolidation identified.
