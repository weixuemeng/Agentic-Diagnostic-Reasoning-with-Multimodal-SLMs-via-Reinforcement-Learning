                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and cough. Evaluate for
 pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, particularly on the lateral view.  There are new
 bilateral basilar opacities, left greater than right. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, bibasilar opacities, left greater than right. This may represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, however, infection should be
 considered in the correct clinical setting.
