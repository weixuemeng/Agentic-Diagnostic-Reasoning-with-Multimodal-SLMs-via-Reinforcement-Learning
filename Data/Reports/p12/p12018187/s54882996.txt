                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Heavy tobacco abuse, chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is relatively unfolded.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Some degenerative changes are seen along
 the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Hyperinflated lungs without focal consolidation.
