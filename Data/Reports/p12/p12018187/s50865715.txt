                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weight loss, weakness  // eval mass,
 cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. There appears to be some right upper
 lung scarring with possible bronchiectasis. Right suprahilar opacity may
 relate to the above although underlying consolidation is not excluded. The
 left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes demonstrate a tortuous, calcified aorta and a mildly
 enlarged cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggest COPD.  Right upper lobe scar with possible
 bronchiectasis. Right suprahilar opacity may relate to the above level
 underlying consolidation not excluded. This high clinical concern for
 intrathoracic mass, CT is more sensitive.
