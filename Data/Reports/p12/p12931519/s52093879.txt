 Assess lead placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs in ___.
 
 New trans subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead originates in
 the new left pectoral generator and ends in the proximal right ventricle.  It
 is possible that the shielding traverses  the tricuspid valve.  No
 pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
 
 Peribronchial opacification in the left lower lobe is more pronounced today
 than before, could be active pneumonia but is more likely increased
 suppuration in a region of severe, chronic bronchiectasis.  Tiny left pleural
 effusion is most likely related to the lower lobe abnormality, rather than
 lead placement.
