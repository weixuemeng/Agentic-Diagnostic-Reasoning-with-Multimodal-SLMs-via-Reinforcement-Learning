                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post ___ rollover.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The soft tissue of the upper anterior chest wall is markedly
 thickened, and should be inspected for possible hematoma.  The manumbrium is
 not clearly delineated and could be fractured. The mid thoracic spine which is
 scoliotic is also difficult to see.  Bone detail views of both manubrium and
 thoracic spine, or Chest CT, are indicated.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate
 a mildly tortuous aorta, but no mediastinal widening.  The lungs are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is
 appreciated but conventional radiography is not designed for detection of
 subtle chest cage trauma; for that determination, detail views of the
 locations of physical findings would be required.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible hematoma, upper anterior chest. Mid thoracic scoliosis;
 trauma must be excluded.  
 
 Findings were communicated to ___ at 8:45 AM on ___ by ___
 ___ over the phone.
