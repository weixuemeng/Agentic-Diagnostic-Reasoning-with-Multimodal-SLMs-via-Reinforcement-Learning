                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lower hemithorax is more dense than previously and there
 is increased pleural thickening at the right costophrenic angle.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears increased in size in comparison to the
 prior study. The lungs are without a focal consolidation or effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Increased right lower hemithorax density is likely due to increased pleural
 thickening. However, a dedicated chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation. 
 2. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is increased in size in comparison to the
 prior study and may be representative of a pericardial effusion. This can be
 further assessed with a dedicated chest CT as well.
