  3. Retrocardiac airspace opacity may represent atelectasis or consolidation,
  depending upon the clinical circumstances.
  4. Moderate cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with CHF exacerbation, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with mild associated interstitial
 edema.  Layering pleural fluid is seen on the lateral view, likely bilateral. 
 Airspace opacities in the lower lungs bilaterally likely represent
 atelectasis, however a superimposed infectious process is not excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  A left pectoral dual-chamber pacemaker and its leads
 project in unchanged location.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with mild associated interstitial edema.
 2. Moderate layering pleural effusions, likely bilateral.
 3. Retrocardiac airspace opacity may represent atelectasis or consolidation,
 depending upon the clinical circumstances.
 4. Moderate cardiomegaly.
