                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent seizure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso obtained at outside hospital ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, accentuated by the
 presence of low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.  Wedge compression
 deformity of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
