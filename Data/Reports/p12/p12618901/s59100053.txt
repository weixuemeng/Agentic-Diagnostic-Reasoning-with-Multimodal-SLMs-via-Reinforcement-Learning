                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe dyspnea, treating for PCP  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 A left Port-A-Cath ends at the mid SVC.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Diffuse, ground-glass and reticular opacities
 predominantly in the left hemithorax, corresponding to ground-glass and
 reticular opacities from CT ___
 
 No pleural effusion. A small, linear opacity projects of the right lung apex.
 
 Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  A small, curvilinear opacity projects over the right lung apex.  This
 likely represents an external structure, however a repeat radiograph after
 removal or repositioned of external structures is recommended to exclude a
 small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2. Diffuse, ground-glass and reticular opacity, predominantly in the left
 hemithorax, corresponding to ground-glass and reticular opacities from CT ___. These appear minimally improved in comparison to ___.
 
 3. Left Port-A-Cath ends at the mid SVC.
