                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of recent pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Resolution of the bilateral mild multifocal opacities that was present in the
 previous exam and mostly compatible with an infectious disease.  There is mild
 pleural residual scaring in the left lateral sulcus that is unchanged. 
 However, there is a new round density of 1.5 cm, only seen on the lateral view
 superimposed to the twelfth vertebral body.  It was difficult to assess this
 region during the last CT scan due to effusion and atelectasis in the lower
 lobe.  Abdominal CT scan done in ___ only showed a tiny micronodule in
 this region. Mild pulmonary hyperinflation.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable and normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Resolution of the multifocal opacities that were mostly compatible with
 disseminated infection.
 
 2.  New nodule only seen on the lateral view superimposed to the twelfth
 vertebral body could be a scar or an active lesion. A CT scan is suggested.
