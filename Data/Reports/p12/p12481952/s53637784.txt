                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Scattered poorly
 defined nodular opacities are seen bilaterally predominantly in the right
 upper lobe and to a lesser extent in the left mid and lower lungs.  Findings
 are most compatible with pneumonia, though followup to resolution is advised
 to exclude underlying lesions.  A small left pleural effusion noted.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette normal.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Scattered poorly defined lung opacities most compatible with
 pneumonia, though followup to resolution is advised to exclude underlying
 lesions. Tiny associated left effusion.
