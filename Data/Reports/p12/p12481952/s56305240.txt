                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment for pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 ill-defined parenchymal opacities in both lungs.  The opacities predominate in
 the left perihilar region, but are also seen in the right perihilar region. 
 The opacities are about 2-3 cm in diameter and show subtle air bronchograms. 
 In absence of a clinical history, the morphology is most suspicious for
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation and further radiographic followup are
 required.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No hilar or mediastinal
 abnormalities.
 
 The referring physician, ___. ___ was not ___ at the time of
 dictation.  Therefore, the physician was contacted by E-mail and informed
 about the new findings.
