                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased
 AP diameter, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No focal
 consolidation is seen; however, there are increased interstitial markings in
 the right ___- and infra-hilar region, increased compared to the prior study,
 which could be due to chronic disease; however, infectious process is not
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Some degenerative
 changes are seen along the spine.  There is again seen anterior wedging of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body.
