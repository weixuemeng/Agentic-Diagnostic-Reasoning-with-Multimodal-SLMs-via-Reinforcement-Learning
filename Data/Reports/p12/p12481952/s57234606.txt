                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough and chest pain after left chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is a new left chest tube with mild decrease in left pleural effusion,
 still moderate-to-large.  Cardiomediastinal structures now are midline.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  The right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac size
 cannot be evaluated, is obscured by the pleural effusion.  There is mild left 
 subcutaneous emphysema.
