 Assess abscess
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 12:03 are submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left peak tail thoracostomy catheter remains in place.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is
 blunting of both costophrenic angles which are consistent with small effusions
 as evident on recent chest CT ___.  There is an evolving opacity in the
 right upper lobe which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration and
 likely correlates to an opacity on the recent chest CT as well.  In addition,
 there are streaky opacities in the left mid and lower lung which could
 represent other areas of infection or possibly atelectasis. Clinical
 correlation is advised. No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
