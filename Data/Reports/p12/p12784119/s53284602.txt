                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left empyema, post drainage.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pigtail thoracostomy tube is unchanged in position, terminating at the
 left lung base.  There is overall decreased retrocardiac density as compared
 to the ___ radiograph, likely reflective of interval drainage. No
 new consolidation or collection is detected.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild
 left basilar atelectasis has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in density of the left retrocardiac opacity, likely
 secondary to drainage of known empyema.  No new consolidation or collection. 
 Improved left basilar atelectasis.
