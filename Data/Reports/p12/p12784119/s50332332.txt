                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Subtle increased opacity in the right lower hemi
 thorax could represent an early bronchopneumonia.  No edema, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not widened. 
 Prominent pulmonary arteries are similar to the prior exam and may suggest
 sequelae of chronic pulmonary hypertension.  A left posterior a lateral rib
 fracture is old, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle increased opacity in the right lower lobe could represent an early
 bronchopneumonia.
 
 2.  Prominent pulmonary arteries may suggest sequelae of chronic pulmonary
 hypertension.
