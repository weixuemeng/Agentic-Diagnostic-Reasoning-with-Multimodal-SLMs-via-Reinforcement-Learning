 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 chest tube draining the empyema in the left mid and lower lung zones. No
 evidence of air-fluid level at this time.  On the frontal view, of the
 increased opacification overlying and to the left of the heart border has
 cleared. If the condition of the patient would per min, a lateral view would
 be helpful to show similar complete clearing posteriorly.
 There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of
 mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles is seen bilaterally.
