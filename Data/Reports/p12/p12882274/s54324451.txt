                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of CHF, CABG, presenting with four days of
 worsening dyspnea, chills, and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  The lateral view is somewhat suboptimal due
 to the patient's overlying arm.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal lateral views due to the patient's overlying arm. 
 Otherwise, mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
