                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F on chemo with fever  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference mid chest CT from ___ as well as chest
 radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Innumerable bilateral pulmonary opacities are seen in this patient with
 extensive bilateral pulmonary metastases.  More confluent area in the left mid
 to lower hemi thorax was most likely present on the prior chest CT.  Slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace pleural
 effusion versus atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the low SVC/cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable bilateral pulmonary opacities in this patient with known extensive
 bilateral pulmonary metastases.  Difficult to exclude an underlying acute
 infectious process, particularly in the lateral left mid to lower lung.
 
 Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis
 versus a trace pleural effusion.
