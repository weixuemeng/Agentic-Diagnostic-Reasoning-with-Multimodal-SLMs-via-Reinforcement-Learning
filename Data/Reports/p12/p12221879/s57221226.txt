                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with 4 month history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mutiple lung nodules, up
 to a centimeter in diameter scattered in all lobes.  Background reticulation
 throughout the lungs reflects widespread interstitial abnormality.  Best
 identified in the right lower lung zone, there is bronchial wall thickening
 and likely bronchiectasis.  The right hilum is mildly enlarged, suggesting
 adenopathy.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral diffuse nodules with reticulations consistent with background
 interstitial process.  These findings are concerning for widespread
 metastasis, perhaps with preexisting diffuse interstitial lung disease. 
 Recommend comparison to and prior chest imaging.  If these are made available,
 an addendum will be added to this report.  If no priors, recommend chest CT
 evaluation. 
 
 These findings were communicated to the ordering physician by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone and in person at 13:30 on ___.
