                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Right-sided pleural effusion status post drainage.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest CTA.  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian approach Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the high right atrium. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are difficult
 to evaluate given diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases, better characterized
 on same-day CT examination.  There is persistent sub partial collapse of the
 right lower lobe.  Right base pleural drainage catheter is in place.  There is
 a small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion, appearing decreased in
 volume compared to the same-day CT examination.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small to moderate right-sided pleural fusion, decreased compared to
 same-day chest CT exam.
 2. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases and partial right lower lobe
 collapse, better characterized on same-day CT exam.
