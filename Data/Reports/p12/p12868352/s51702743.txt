                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion,
 question infiltrate.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heart is normal limits in size.  Lungs appear well inflated without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  There is soft tissue prominence in the right hilum which is
 felt to most likely be vascular in etiology and accentuated due to the fact
 that the patient is mildly rotated on the current study.  However, given the
 absence of comparison studies, short-interval followup chest plain film in one
 month would be prudent.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
