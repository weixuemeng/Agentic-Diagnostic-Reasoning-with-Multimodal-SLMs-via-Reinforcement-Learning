                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.  The lung volumes
 are low.  The mediastinal structures are shifted to the left.  The left
 costophrenic angle is obscured.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Leftward mediastinal shift likely due to left lower lobe atelectasis.
