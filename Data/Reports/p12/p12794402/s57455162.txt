                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, leukocytosis and ?pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The heart size is normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  No
 definitive acute cardiopulmonary finding is seen.  There is a subtle rounded
 opacity in the right lower lobe adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm but this
 is only seen on one projection and is of somewhat dubious significance. 
 Followup departmental radiograph may be helpful.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No definitive acute findings.
