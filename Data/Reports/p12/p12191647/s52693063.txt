                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new atrial fibrillation, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In
 comparison to the prior studies, lung volumes are lower. New moderate right
 pleural effusion with possible loculation. New increased heterogeneously dense
 opacification in the right lower lobe may represent compressive atelectasis or
 consolidation. Increased bilateral prominent interstitial markening probably
 represent mild superimposed edema. There left lung is clear. There is no left
 effusion. There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 otherwise unremarkable. 
  
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval development of moderate right effusion with possible loculation
 and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation. Pneumonia should be considered
 in the appropriate clinical context.
 2. Mild bilateral interstitial edema.
 3. Low lung volumes.
