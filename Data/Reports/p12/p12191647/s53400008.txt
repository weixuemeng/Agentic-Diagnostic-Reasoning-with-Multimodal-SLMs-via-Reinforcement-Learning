                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of hilar lymphadenopathy for interval change. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and FDG Tumor Imaging
 study from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated which crowd the bronchovascular structures. Again
 noted is right hilar prominence consistent with known lymphadenopathy, which
 while difficult to compare, appears more prominent.  Known right upper lobe
 pulmonary nodules are not clearly delineated on this study.  Linear right lung
 base opacity is noted and in a similar region as FDG-avid focus in the right
 lung base but difficult to assess and may be atelectasis.  No other focal
 consolidation is noted.  Cardiac silhouette appears stable.  Dextroscoliosis
 of the mid-thoracic spine is again noted along with kyphosis. Moderate hiatal
 hernia is again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated and crowd the bronchovascular structures.  There is
 however suggestion of increased right hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is also an
 opacity at the right lung base which may be atelectasis but in the same region
 as previously visualized FDG-avid focus noted on ___.  A
 contrast-enhanced CT of the chst is recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 These findings were submitted to the Radiology Critical Result Dashboard by
 Dr. ___ on ___.
