                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right hilus is prominant from known right hilar adenopathy recognized on CT
 component  of PET-CT, but hilar promimance is disproportionately smaller to
 the actual extent of lymphadenopathy.   Heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. Both lungs are clear.  No pleural abnormality.  Spine is
 remarkable for scoliotic deformity.  Old healed rib fractures are present on
 the right side.
 
 Contrast enhanced CT of chest if recommended for further evaluation of hilar
 lymphadenopathy.
