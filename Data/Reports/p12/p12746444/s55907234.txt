 atelectasis are unchanged from radiograph earlier today.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Right-sided internal jugular
 central venous line ends in the cavoatrial junction.  Endotracheal tube ends 7
 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and
 out of field of view. Gaseous distension of the stomach is present.
