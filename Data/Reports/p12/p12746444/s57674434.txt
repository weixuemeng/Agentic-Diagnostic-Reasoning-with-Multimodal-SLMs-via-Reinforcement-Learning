                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new nasogastric tube placement,
 evaluate position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 552.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ centered around the
 epigastric region was obtained, the lung apices are not included.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A nasogastric tube is in place with the tip projecting over the expected
 location of the stomach.  The distal end of a right internal jugular central
 line is seen with the tip in the distal SVC.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There continue to be bilateral patchy airspace opacities
 with a more focal area of consolidation in the retrocardiac region.  These
 findings may reflect mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema or possibly multifocal
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Skin ___ are seen overlying
 the mid abdomen and clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with
 prior cholecystectomy.
