                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new O2 requirement  // Evidence of pulm
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of CT torso
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hyperinflation, compatible with COPD.  There is moderate to
 moderately severe cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous and dilated, but
 similar in configuration.  The pulmonary artery is are probably enlarged. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis,  including lower lobe atelectasis seen on the
 lateral view.  There is minimal blunting of the right and left costophrenic
 angles.  No frank consolidation.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 Compared with ___, the PICC line has been removed in the
 bilateral effusions are probably smaller.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly with tortuous enlarged aorta, unchanged.  Note is made
 that the report of the ___ CT described an extensive type B aortic
 dissection.  Please see report of that study for additional details.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and minimal blunting of the right and left costophrenic
 angles.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Background COPD.
