                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation with rhonchorous breath sounds.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiographs from ___.  Outside
 hospital CT abdomen from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the outside
 hospital CT from earlier today at 5:32 p.m.  Bibasilar and right mid lung
 heterogeneous opacities are at least partially due to compressive atelectasis,
 although a concomitant bibasilar process such as aspiration pneumonitis or
 infection is thought likely.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  Enlargement of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aortic
 contours likely relate to a known intramural hematoma, as seen on CT from
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings concerning for bibasilar aspiration pneumonitis and/or pneumonia.
 Concomitant atelectasis is also present at the bases.
 
 2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions, as seen on CT from earlier today at
 5:32 p.m.
