                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures and nonproductive cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal in
 size and there is mild tortuosity of the aorta.  Lungs are clear without
 evidence of vascular congestion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 could represent pleural fluid or scarring.
