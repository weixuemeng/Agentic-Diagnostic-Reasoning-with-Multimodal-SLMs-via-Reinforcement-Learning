                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there still is a PICC line on the
 right in place.  The line shows a normal course and can be followed to the
 level of the lower SVC but not beyond that point, given overlaying anatomical
 structures. Lateral radiograph could be obtained to clarify precise line
 position.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild fluid overload.
