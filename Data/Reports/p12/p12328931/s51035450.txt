                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Lung volumes are slightly increased, but lungs are grossly clear
 bilaterally, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings. 
 Mild scoliosis is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No chest radiographic findings to suggest ___
 pneumonitis, but this diagnosis is more readily made by high-resolution chest.
 Consider CT for more complete evaluation if warranted clinically.
