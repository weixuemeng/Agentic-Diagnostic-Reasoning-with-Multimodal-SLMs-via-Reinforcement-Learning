                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There is mild diffuse increased interstitial lung markings of unknown
 etiology.  This could be related to pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Because the heart contour and azygous vein are not dilated,
 it would be a non cardiogenic edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Mild increased in interstitial lung markings of unknown origin.  It could
 possibly be due to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
