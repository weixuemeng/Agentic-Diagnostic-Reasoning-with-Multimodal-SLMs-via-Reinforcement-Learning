 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The heart size is borderline enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.

 Bibasilar atelectasis.
