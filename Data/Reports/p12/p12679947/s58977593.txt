                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Slight
 increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to mild
 interstitial edema.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 cardiac valve replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions, and
 interstitial edema suggest CHF.  Difficult to exclude underlying bibasilar
 consolidation.
