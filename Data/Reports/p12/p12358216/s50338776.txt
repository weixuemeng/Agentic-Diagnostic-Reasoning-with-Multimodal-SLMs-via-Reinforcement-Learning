                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position
 with the exception of endotracheal tube, whose tip now terminates
 approximately 3 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by peribronchial cuffing and bilateral combined
 interstitial and perihilar edema, worse since the recent radiograph.  Right
 pleural catheter remains in place in the lower right hemithorax, with an
 enlarging right pleural effusion, now large in size.  No visible pneumothorax
 on the supine radiograph.
