                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pneumomediastinum, seizures,
 intubated.  Study requested for evaluation of pneumonia, pneumomediastinum,
 and ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 loops in the gastric fundus.  Right PICC line terminates 6 cm below the level
 of the carina. 
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been
 interval improvement of large right pleural effusion. Heterogeneous opacities
 in the left lung have improved, likely due to edema.  There is no pneumothorax
 or appreciable pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. Right PICC line terminates 6 cm
 below the level of the carina. In order to locate it in the low SVC,
 withdrawal of 2 cm is recommended.
 
 2.  Interval decrease of large right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Improved heterogeneous opacities in the left lung, likely due to edema.
