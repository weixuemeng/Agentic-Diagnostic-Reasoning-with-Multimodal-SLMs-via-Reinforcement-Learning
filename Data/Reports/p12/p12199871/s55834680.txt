                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hx sarcoidosis with liver and lung involvement
 presents with multiple weeks of RUQ pain and recent waxing/waning AMS  // RUQ:
 eval for cirrhosis, portal vein patencyCXR: eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 bilateral interestitial opacities with subtle peribronchovascular abnormality
 in the juxta hilar regions, right greater than left. Mild cardiomegaly is
 present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable. A right port catheter tip terminates in the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial opacities may be due to pulmonary edema in the setting of
 cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement; however, given the clinical history,
 interstitial lung involvement due to sarcoidosis is also possible. Consider
 conventional PA and lateral radiograph or CT for further evaluation.
