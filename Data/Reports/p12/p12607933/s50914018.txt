                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ascending aortic replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal if any vascular congestion.
 The discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial
 effusion.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.
