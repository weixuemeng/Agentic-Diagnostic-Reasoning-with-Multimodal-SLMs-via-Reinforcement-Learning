 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:12 PM
  The patient has been extubated, otherwise there is no significant change since
  the prior study earlier this morning.  Left retrocardiac opacity with obscured
  left hemidiaphragm.  Atelectasis at the right base.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
  Support devices are in consistent position.  Right hilar fullness may have
  minimally improved although this appearance may be due to patient rotation. 
  There are likely at least small bilateral pleural effusions causing blunting
  of the costophrenic sulci.  There is no pneumothorax.
