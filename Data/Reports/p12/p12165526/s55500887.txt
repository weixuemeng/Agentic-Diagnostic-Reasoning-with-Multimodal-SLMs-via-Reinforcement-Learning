                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TIA, rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Probable slightly rotated positioning.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, which may reflect COPD.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  A rounded density projects
 in the right cardiophrenic region, seen only on the frontal view. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Possible background COPD.  
 2) No acute pulmonary process identified. 
 3) Rounded density in right cardiophrenic region, not fully characterized, ?
 rekated to tortuous descending aorta. If clinically indicated, oblique views
 may help for further assessment.
