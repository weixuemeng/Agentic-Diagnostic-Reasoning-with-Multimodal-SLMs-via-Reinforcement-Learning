                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p left pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis  //
 eval for reaccumulation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the left pleural effusion is probably slightly
 larger.  Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity, which may also be slightly
 more pronounced.  There is also slight left perihilar atelectasis.
 
 Again seen is a small right pleural effusion which may be slightly improved. 
 Minimal atelectasis in the right infrahilar region is improved.  Right lung is
 otherwise grossly clear, without CHF or focal infiltrate.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged, though partially obscured on the left. 
 Sternotomy wires again noted.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity and small to moderate left pleural effusion are
 slightly more pronounced.
 
 Patchy left perihilar opacity is also more pronounced, question due to
 atelectasis.
 
 Small right pleural effusion and right base atelectasis may be slightly
 improved.
