                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // f/u effusions, atx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, there has been progressive opacification in the
 retrocardiac region, with new near-complete obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There likely reflects a moderate size left pleural effusion,
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Mild atelectasis at the right lung base medially is noted.
 
 Mediastinum remains midline.  No CHF.
 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small
 right pleural effusion, improved compared with the prior film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac opacification, likely reflecting a combination of pleural
 fluid, together with atelectasis and/ or consolidation.
