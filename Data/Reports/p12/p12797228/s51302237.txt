                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 2 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the
 stomach.  The upper mediastinal contour is widened and indistinct with no
 clear visualization of a normal aortic arch contour.  There is also pleural
 thickening at the right apex.  The right upper to mid lung shows diffuse
 opacification with volume loss and there is also left basilar opacity that
 obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Mediastinal contour
 widening with a capped appearance of the right apex.  This appearance is
 nonspecific but includes the possibility of aortic syndrome or mediastinal
 mass.  CT is recommended to evaluate further on an urgent basis when feasible
 clinically.  Nonspecific patchy right upper and left lower lung opacities. 
 Differential considerations are broad and include atelectasis and pneumonia,
 which is probably the etiology regarding the right upper lobe opacity.  These
 can also be reassessed with CT.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:45 p.m. at the time of interpretation
 by telephone.
