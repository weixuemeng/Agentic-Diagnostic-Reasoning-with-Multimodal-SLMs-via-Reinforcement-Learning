                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:54 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman admitted for unresponsiveness.  Now intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has cleared from most of the lungs.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular distention persist reflecting cardiac
 decompensation.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 2.5 cm above the carina, with the
 chin in partial flexion this is reasonable.  An upper enteric drainage tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  I see no central vascular line.  No
 pneumothorax.
