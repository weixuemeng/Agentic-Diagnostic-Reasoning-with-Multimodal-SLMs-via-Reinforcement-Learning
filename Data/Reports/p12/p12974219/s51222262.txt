 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, patient is post-op, assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.

 layering pleural effusions.  Lung volumes are low.  Probable compressive
 atelectasis in the lower lungs.  The mid to upper lungs appear well aerated
 without pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour
 appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with lower lung compressive
 atelectasis.  Please note, in the correct clinical setting, a pneumonia in the
 left lung base cannot be excluded.
