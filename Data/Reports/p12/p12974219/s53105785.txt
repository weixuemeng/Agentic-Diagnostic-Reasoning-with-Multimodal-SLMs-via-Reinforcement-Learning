                                 FINAL REPORT
 Status post CABG, left chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 There are very low lung volumes.  The patient's body habitus makes for a film
 with low tissue differentiation.
 
 Since the prior chest x-ray, the nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube and
 Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed.  A right IJ sheath is present with the
 tip in the mid SVC.
 
 No pneumothorax is identified in either apex, but given the limitations, one
 could be easily overlooked.  Atelectasis at both bases is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax seen but not totally excluded.
