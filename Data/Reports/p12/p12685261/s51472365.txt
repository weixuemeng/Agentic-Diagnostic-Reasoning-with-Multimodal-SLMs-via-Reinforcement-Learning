                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with NG tube placed  // NG tube placement in proper
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 23:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and low lung volumes. An enteric
 tube tip appears to be within the stomach, though side port appears to be just
 superior to the gastroesophageal junction and would recommend advancement by
 approximately 5 cm for optimal positioning.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 terminates in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the right lung
 base.  Centrilobular nodular opacities in the right upper lobe seen on
 previous chest CT are not well assessed on the current radiograph.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.  Multiple clips are noted in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  Inferior vena cava filter is partly imaged in upper
 abdomen, just to the right of midline.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube tip appears to be within the stomach though side port lies just
 superior to the gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend advancement by
 approximately 5 cm for optimal positioning.
