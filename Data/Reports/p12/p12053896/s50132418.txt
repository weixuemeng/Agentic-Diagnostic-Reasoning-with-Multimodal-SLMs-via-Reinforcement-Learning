                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD, CHF, presenting with dyspnea on
 exertion, now with continued shortness of breath status post diuresis, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study, ___ at 15:16.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11:26, is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement but persistent mild pulmonary edema.  There is more focal
 airspace consolidation at the left base which could reflect persistent lower
 lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered.  There are
 layering bilateral effusions, left greater than right.  Given patient's marked
 rotation, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible on
 the current examination.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
