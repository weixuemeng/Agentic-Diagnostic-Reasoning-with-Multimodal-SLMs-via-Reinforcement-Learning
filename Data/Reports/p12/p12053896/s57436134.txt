                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a history of pneumonia and recent
 admission here with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged, unchanged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema.  There is
 retrocardiac opacity which could be secondary to atelectasis, but a developing
 infection cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity could be consistent with atelectasis
 or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
