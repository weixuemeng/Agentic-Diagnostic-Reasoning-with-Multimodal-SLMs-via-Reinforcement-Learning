                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman admitted for PNA (now resolved), oropharygeal
 dysphagia, known pleural effusions.  Previously weaned off O2, now with new O2
 requirement.  // hypoxemia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ an allowing for rotated positioning, the overall
 appearance is probably is slightly worse.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are quite low obscuring part of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Again seen are bibasilar opacities that likely represent a
 combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 There is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF -- this
 is probably slightly worse, but they could be exacerbated by low inspiratory
 volumes and changes at the bases.
 
 Tubing or probe is seen is now seen overlying the mediastinum.  It courses
 left, question due to hiatal hernia.  Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar opacities and CHF findings that appear
 slightly worse.  Possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Tubing overlying mediastinum -- question orogastric type tube, extending into
 hiatal hernia.  Clinical correlation requested.
