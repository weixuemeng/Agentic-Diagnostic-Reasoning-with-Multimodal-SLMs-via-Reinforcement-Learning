                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation, evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiograph from 9:46 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, 3.5 cm cranial to the
 carina.  A left internal jugular approach central venous catheter terminates
 in the low SVC.  Compared to earlier study, lung volumes are lower,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 redemonstration of small left-sided pleural effusion as well as hazy opacity
 at the left lung base in the background of some mild edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate position of endotracheal tube.
 2.  Redemonstration of left-sided pleural effusion, left base opacities in the
 background of mild edema, which could represent infection.  Lateral view may
 be helpful for characterization.
