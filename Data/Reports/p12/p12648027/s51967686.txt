 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube is in stomach.  The left internal jugular line tip is at the level
 of cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as
 there is no change in bilateral pleural effusions, bibasal consolidations and
 most likely present interstitial pulmonary edema and substantial scoliosis. 
 As compared to the prior study, the previously malpositioned NG tube has been
 removed.
