                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent Klebsiella pneumonia and ICU stay with intubation, assess
 for etiology of tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.  Dobbhoff tube
 terminates within the stomach.  Low lung volumes with chronically elevated
 left hemidiaphragm and resultant left basal atelectasis are noted.  Small
 pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  There is mild vascular congestion
 without overt edema.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  No pneumothorax.  S-shaped
 scoliosis and degenerative disease of the lumbar spine and glenohumeral joint
 changes are severe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable small pleural effusions and mild left basal atelectasis
 in part related to chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
