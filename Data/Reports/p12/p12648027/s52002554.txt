                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  f/u on pneumonia  // f/u on pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared the previous radiograph, the transparency of the lung parenchyma
 has substantially increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. There
 currently is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
 All pre-existing opacities have resolved. The nasogastric tube was removed in
 the interval.
