                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, fever  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Calcified left hilar lymph node and calcified nodule in
 the left mid lung field are unchanged, compatible with prior granulomatous
 disease. Aortic knob calcifications are present. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Right basilar and left lateral pleural calcifications are present suggestive
 of prior asbestos exposure. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild atelectasis at the lung bases. No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
