 most consistent with calcified granuloma is, also seen on prior study. Left
 hilar calcified lymph node also suggest prior granulomatous disease. There may
 be punctate right-sided calcified granulomas as well. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Right diaphragmatic pleural linear
 calcifications are better appreciated on the prior study. No pneumothorax is
 seen. Mild right basilar atelectasis. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may be due to overlying soft tissue however a very trace pleural
 effusion is not excluded.

 Bibasilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation. Slight blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, trace effusion not excluded.
