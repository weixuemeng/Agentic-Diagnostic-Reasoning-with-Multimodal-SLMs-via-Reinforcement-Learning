                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, getting intubated, check tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 23:44 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the patient has been intubated.  The ET tube tip
 lies at the lower edge of the midclavicular heads, approximately 5.6 cm above
 the carina.  
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette is again noted. There is upper zone redistribution
 and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, though this appears slightly improved compared
 with the prior film.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present.  No gross effusion is
 detected on either side, though the extreme right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.  Incidental note is made of bilateral left greater
 than right apical pleural thickening and calcification along the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 Calcified left hilar node and calcified left granuloma are noted.  Additional
 calcified granuloma may be present in the right upper zone as well. 
 
 A rounded density overlies the right upper quadrant of the abdomen -- ?  large
 calcified gallstone.  (This is in keeping with a finding on the ___
 abdominal CT.)
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip at lower edge of midclavicular heads, approximately 5.6 cm
 above the carina.  
 2.  Cardiomegaly and CHF, similar to the prior study.
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly improved.
