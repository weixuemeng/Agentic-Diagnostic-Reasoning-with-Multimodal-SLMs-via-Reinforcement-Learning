 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are lucent and hyper inflated consistent with known COPD. Linear
 density at the left lung base most likely represents a focus of scarring.  No
 signs of pneumonia or edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD without superimposed pneumonia or edema.
