 Linear atelectasis or scarring is again seen at the left lung base. The lungs

 particularly in the right upper lung raising the possibility of underlying
 emphysema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance.

 Hyperexpanded lungs with possible underlying emphysema.  Stable left basilar
 atelectasis or scarring without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
