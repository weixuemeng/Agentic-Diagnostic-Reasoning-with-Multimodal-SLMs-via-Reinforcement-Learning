 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Again seen is mild cardiomegaly, with sternotomy
 wires and left-sided pacemaker, lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  The
 mediastinum remains midline.
