                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New fever and shortness of breath, question pneumonia or aspiration
 in the setting of seizures.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Rotated positioning.  There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this,
 the heart is probably slightly enlarged.  Sternotomy wires are present.  Two
 leads from a far-left pacemaker pack are noted, with lead tips over right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Detailed assessment of the cardiac contour is
 limited by rotation and low lung volumes. 
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without definite CHF.  There is some hazy
 increased retrocardiac density, probably unchanged, which could reflect some
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Elsewhere, no focal opacity to
 suggest superimposed pneumonia/infiltrate is identified.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy retrocardiac density is similar to prior and could represent
 some collapse and/or consolidation in the left lower lung.  No new
 superimposed opacity is identified.
