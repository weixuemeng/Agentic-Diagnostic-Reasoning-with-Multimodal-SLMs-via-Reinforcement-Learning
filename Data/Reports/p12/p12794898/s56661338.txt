                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and fever and lower right side crackles.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There are bibasilar opacities that
 have developed in the interim, associated with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Most likely findings represent
 interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema given the rapid course. 
 Atypical infection is less likely.  Surgical clips in the left hemithorax are
 unchanged.
