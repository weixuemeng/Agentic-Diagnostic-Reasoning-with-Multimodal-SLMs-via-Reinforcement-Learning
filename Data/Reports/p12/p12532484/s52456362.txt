                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, off Coumadin for four days for a procedure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable without
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear opacities in both lung
 bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
