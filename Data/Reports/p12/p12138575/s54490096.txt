 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:11 PM
  Interval development of a small to moderate right pneumothorax with leftward
  mediastinal shift, under clear if due to previous left lower lobe collapse or
  new tension.  There has also been placement of a right-sided chest tube and 3
  left-sided chest tubes and presumed needle thoracostomy bilaterally. 
  Endotracheal tube projects 9.1 cm above the carina.
  
  The above findings were communicated urgently via telephone by Dr. ___ to
  Dr. ___ ___ at 20:49 on ___, ___ min after discovery.  An
  initial call was made earlier, but the patient was actively coding after
  intubation and attempt for bronchoscopy.
  
  
  Added images at 20:54 reveal interval placement of a transesophageal echo
  probe.  A radiopaque structure lateral to the distal trachea is of unclear
  significance, possibly loculated fluid or the aorta.  It appears slightly more
  dense when compared with the radiograph of 16:28 on the same day.  Small to
  moderate right pneumothorax persists.
  
  Updated findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
  at 21:00 on ___, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LLL collapse, s/p intubation,  // intubation
 tube placement      intubation tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs on ___ at 16:28.
 
 4 serial chest radiographs show successive insertion of thoracostomy tubes,
 ultimately numbering 3 on the left, one on the right.
 
 Since ___:00 a right thoracostomy tube has been inserted, and there is
 a new right pneumothorax at least small, perhaps larger an collected
 anteriorly in this supine view.  Orientation of the right thoracostomy tube is
 consistent with though not diagnostic of fissural placement.  There is no
 appreciable right pleural effusion or any abnormality in the compensatorily
 over inflated right lung.
 
 Severe leftward mediastinal shift and elevation of the left hemi diaphragm
 reflecting left lower lobe collapse and poor aeration of the left lower lobe
 is still present, but aeration in the left lower lobe has worsened and is a
 new left pleural effusion are presumably hemo thorax, that develops during the
 pleural tube insertions and is slightly smaller on the fourth in this series
 than on the previous images.  3 new left thoracostomy tubes have been placed. 
 New endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, 9 cm from
 the carina, 4 cm above optimal placement, particularly in light of presumed
 left bronchial obstruction responsible for left lower lobe collapse.  Heart
 size is indeterminate.
