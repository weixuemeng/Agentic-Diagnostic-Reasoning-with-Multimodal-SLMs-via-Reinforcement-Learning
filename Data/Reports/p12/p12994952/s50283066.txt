  In comparison to the chest radiograph of ___, no significant
  change.  The right lung appears better aerated.  There has been interval
  removal of the nasogastric tube and right IJ central catheter.  Marked
  elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again seen, with air-filled loops of
  bowel under the right hemidiaphragm.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
  opacification is likely due to pulmonary vascular congestion, although
  superimposed pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p open repair of AAA  // ? pleural effusions      ? pleural
 effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there are low lung volumes especially on the right, with marked elevation of
 the hemidiaphragm.  Bilateral opacifications most likely reflect pulmonary
 vascular congestion, though superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
 The right IJ catheter and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
