                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p open repair of ruptured AAA ___  // c/o wheezing     
 c/o wheezing
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.  Marked elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is again seen, increasing the apparent transverse diameter of
 the mildly elevated heart.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications is
 probably related to pulmonary vascular congestion, though it would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Right IJ catheter is unchanged.  There has been placement
 of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the esophagogastric junction,
 where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  An abdominal film could be
 obtained if the precise position of the tip of the enteric tube is required.
