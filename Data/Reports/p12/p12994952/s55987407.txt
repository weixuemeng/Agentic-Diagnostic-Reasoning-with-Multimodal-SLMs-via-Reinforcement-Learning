                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB  // SOB ?PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to a chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, there is been a
 mild increase in pulmonary vascular congestion.  Marked elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with an underlying prominent loop of air-filled colon are
 unchanged.  Left lung volume is low, but unchanged. No obvious pleural
 effusions or other pleural abnormalities.  Tracheal deviation is unchanged and
 consistent with known, large thyroid nodule seen on CTA chest dated ___.  Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased, moderate pulmonary edema.  No radiographic evidence of PE, although
 chest radiographs are suboptimal for PE evaluation and a CTPA should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical scenario.
