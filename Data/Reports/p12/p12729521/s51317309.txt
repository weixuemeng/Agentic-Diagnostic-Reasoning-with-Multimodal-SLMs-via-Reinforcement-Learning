                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with aortic valve
 replacement, assessment for infiltrates in a patient with leukocytosis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates stable appearance of post-sternotomy wires.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable except for mild cardiomegaly. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, decreased on the right but potentially
 slightly increased on the left as compared to the prior study.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No definitive focal consolidations demonstrated to suggest
 infectious process.  The replaced aortic valve is in expected position as
 demonstrated on the lateral view.
