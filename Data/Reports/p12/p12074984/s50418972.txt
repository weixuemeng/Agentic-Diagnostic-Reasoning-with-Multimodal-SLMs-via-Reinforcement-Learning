                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with multiple co-moribities including CHF,
 presenting with elevated WBC, abdominal distention, diarrhea, overall feeling
 ill
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mild to moderately enlarged.  Coronary artery stent is
 demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures noted.  No pulmonary edema is visualized. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis,
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax detected on this
 supine exam.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
