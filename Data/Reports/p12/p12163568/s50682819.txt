 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sudden-onset fever.  Chest x-ray with
 small consolidating atelectasis versus pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 21:47.
 
 AP portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 1:35 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PIC line remains in place with the tip in the mid SVC. 
 Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 There has been interval improvement in a patchy medial air-space opacity
 consistent with resolved atelectasis.  No focal air-space consolidation is
 seen to suggest pneumonia.  Surgical chain sutures are again seen at the left
 apex.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are appreciated.  There is some
 prominence of the perihilar vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
