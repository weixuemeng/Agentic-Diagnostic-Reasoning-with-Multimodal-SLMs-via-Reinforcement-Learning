                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 21:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mitral valve endocarditis,
 osteomyelitis status post washout and laminectomy in OR, now with fevers and
 tachycardia.  Evaluate for acute infectious process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 8:01.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 21:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line remains in place within the mid SVC.  Lung
 volumes are somewhat diminished.  There is patchy opacity at right medial lung
 base which may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  Followup imaging may be helpful.  Surgical chain sutures
 are seen at the left apex.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax has
 diminished given supine technique.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.
