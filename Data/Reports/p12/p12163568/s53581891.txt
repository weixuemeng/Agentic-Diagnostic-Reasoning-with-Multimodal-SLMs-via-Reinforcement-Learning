                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the PICC line
 extends to the mid portion of the SVC.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  No definite vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.
