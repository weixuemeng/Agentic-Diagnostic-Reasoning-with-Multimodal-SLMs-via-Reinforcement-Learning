 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, initially.  Final reading in conjunction with

 FINDINGS:   Low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular crowding and hilar
 size, but there is new heterogenous/ground glass opacification in both lower
 lungs, bronchial cuffing, and mild bilateral hilar adenopathy.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large effusion and no confluent consolidation.
