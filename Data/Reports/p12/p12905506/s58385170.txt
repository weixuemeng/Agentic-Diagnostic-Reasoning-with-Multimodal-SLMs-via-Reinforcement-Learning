                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with sarcoidosis and new dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs and CT scans
 since ___, most recently ___ and ___:
 
 CT scanning over the past ___ years has documented the worsening, between ___
 and ___, of a diffuse infiltrative abnormality of the lungs, most marked
 always in the right lung.  Since ___, the radiographic severity of the
 abnormality has improved. Symmetric entral adenopathy has been a feature of
 the abnormality since the earlier studies.  It is still present, but also
 improved.  Airtrapping is present at the lung bases.  Large pulmonary arteries
 corresponded with the clinical assessment of pulmonary hypertension. The
 rudimentary evaluation of cardiac chambers by non-gated chest CT has shown
 mild to moderate enlargement of the right ventricle and a surprisingly
 thick-walled left ventricle.  Review of chest radiographs shows a mild
 increase in the background attenuation of the lungs, particularly the right on
 ___, with an increase in heart size over baseline, both of which
 returned to the baseline appearance just eight days later.  The time course
 suggests there was a transient overlay of pulmonary edema.  Today, once again,
 there has been a modest increase in the background density of the right lung
 as well as an increase in caliber of the circulation to that side, pointing to
 cardiac decompensation once again.  There is no pleural effusion, or any
 findings to suggest pneumonia.
