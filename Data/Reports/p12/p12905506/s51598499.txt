                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for increased fibrosis in a patient with shortness of
 breath and a history of sarcoidosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 most recent chest radiograph of ___, interstitial abnormality has
 increased especially in the left lung which could be due to increased
 pulmonary fibrosis; however, interval increase in severe cardiomegaly may
 indicate a component of pulmonary edema due to heart failure.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Absence of the right fifth posterior rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral interstitial abnormality has increased since ___ especially in the left lung which may be due to increased pulmonary
 fibrosis or pulmonary edema from heart failure.  CT is recommended to clarify
 the etiology of the increased interstital abnormality; however, diuresis and a
 repeat chest x-ray are recommended if failure is suspected.
 
 Findings were placed on the critical results dashboard by Dr. ___
 at 5:48PM.
