 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with interstitial abnormality.  History of CHF
 post-diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild interstitial edema has
 improved.  Remaining diffuse interstitial abnormalities are worse in the right
 upper and right middle lobes, are more longstanding, related with lung
 fibrosis.  There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or pleural
 effusions.  The aorta is tortuous.  The main pulmonary artery is enlarged as
 before, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
