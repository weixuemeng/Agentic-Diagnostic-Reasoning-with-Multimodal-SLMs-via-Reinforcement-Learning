                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHSET RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  On chemoradiation treatment for cervical cancer, presenting with
 two days of not feeling well.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy areas of opacity in the lingula and
 probably right middle lobe appear unchanged.  Right mid lung opacification has
 decreased substantially however.  However, there is streaky new opacity in the
 right upper lobe.  Reverse S shaped moderate S shaped thoracolumbar curvature
 is observed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague new right upper lobe opacity, possibly due to atelectasis or airway
 inflammation; although probably less likely, early development of pneumonia is
 not excluded.  Decreased right mid lung opacity.  Otherwise no significant
 change.
