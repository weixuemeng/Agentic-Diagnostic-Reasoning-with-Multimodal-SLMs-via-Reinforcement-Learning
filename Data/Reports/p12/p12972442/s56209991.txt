                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs of pulmonary edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is a subtle nodular opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung, seen only on the frontal view, which is of
 unclear etiology.  This finding was not seen on prior exam.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or CHF.  Vague nodularity in the left mid lung for
 which non-emergent chest CT is recommended to further assess.
