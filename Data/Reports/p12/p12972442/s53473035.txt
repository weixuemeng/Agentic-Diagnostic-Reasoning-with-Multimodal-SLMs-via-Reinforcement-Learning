                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, diverticulitis, s/p renal transplant
 // Eval for pneumonia vs. pulmonary infiltrates (?aspiration)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal. Mediastinum is stable. Since the prior study there
 is no substantial change in upper and lower lobe interstitial opacities
 consistent with pulmonary edema. Potentially superimposed infectious process
 in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small.
