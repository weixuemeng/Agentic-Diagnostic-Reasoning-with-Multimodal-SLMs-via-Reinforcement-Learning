                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath, acutely worsening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and two lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Mild cardiomegaly is slightly
 worsened since the prior study.  Flattened hemidiaphragms with hyperinflation
 are indicative of COPD.  New prominent interstitial markings are compatible
 with mild pulmonary edema.  Additional new band-like opacity partly obscuring
 the right heart border may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is
 evidence of prior hernia repair in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New interstitial prominence compatible with mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, with a new right basilar opacity, which may represent
 pneumonia or atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
