                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with respiratory distress, COPD vs CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta
 is diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with
 unchanged enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature,
 slightly worse in the interval.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Streaky
 atelectasis is noted in the retrocardiac region.  No focal consolidation. 
 Mild thickening of the minor fissure is unchanged.  A small left pleural
 effusion is likely present.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Multiple spiral
 tacks are seen in the left upper quadrant compatible with prior hernia repair.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and possible trace left pleural effusion.
