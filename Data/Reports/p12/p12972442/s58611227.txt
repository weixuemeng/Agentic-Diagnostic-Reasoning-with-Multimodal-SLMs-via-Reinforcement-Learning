                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant, COPD, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications and mild unfolding.  Hilar contours are stable.  Previous
 pattern of pulmonary edema has resolved.  Previously noted lingular, left
 lower, and right middle lobe opacities have nearly essentially resolved. 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  The previously noted pulmonary edema has
 resolved, and there is substantial interval improvement in previously noted
 bibasilar airspace opacities compatible with resolving pneumonia.
