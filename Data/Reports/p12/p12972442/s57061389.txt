                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD/pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with background COPD.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly.  The pulmonary hila are prominent, with a tapered
 appearance bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  There is slight blunting of both costophrenic angles.  No large
 alveolar consolidations are seen.  Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 and right cardiophrenic regions is noted.  Atelectasis and/or trace fluid in
 the minor fissure is again seen, slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with predominant interstitial edema, which is new compared
 with ___ at 17:00 p.m.  Small bilateral effusions and patchy bibasilar
 opacity.
