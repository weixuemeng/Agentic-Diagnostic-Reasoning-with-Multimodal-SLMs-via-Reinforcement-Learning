                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of lymphoma, now presenting with lower
 extremity edema and new atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities in the lung apices,
 right greater than left, correspond with areas of scarring from probable prior
 radiation, findings better characterized on prior CT.  No confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also unchanged from prior.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings is equivocal for mild interstitial edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Biapical opacities consistent with scarring from probable prior radiation.
 2.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Equivocal mild interstitial edema.
