                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in similar position except for
 an endotracheal tube which has been withdrawn slightly and now terminates 7 cm
 above the carina.  This could be advanced a few centimeters for standard
 positioning.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lung
 volumes are increased compared to the prior study, and there has been overall
 improved aeration at the lung bases except for a worsening opacity medially in
 the right lower lobe.  This most likely represents atelectasis and less likely
 a focus of aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.  Small right pleural
 effusion is unchanged, and there is no visible pneumothorax.
