                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The Dobbhoff tube extends into the upper
 stomach, before coiling back on itself so that the opaque tip is pointing
 upward at about the level of the cardioesophageal junction.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is somewhat enlarged without definite vascular
 congestion or acute pneumonia.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
 
 Of incidental note, the outermost portion of the right hemithorax has been
 excluded from the image.
