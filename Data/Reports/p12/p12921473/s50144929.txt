                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with Dobhoff catheter, prior to advancing.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the

 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A Dobbhoff catheter is not seen on this image.  An enteric catheter with the
 appearance of a standard nasogastric tube courses into the left upper quadrant
 with side port projecting just distal to the expected location of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Tracheostomy is in standard position.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and small left pleural
 effusion persist.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  Left PICC
 appears similarly positioned.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Lung volumes are
 low with bibasilar atelectasis.  Clips and other hardware project over the
 upper and mid-abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dobbhoff catheter not seen.  Clinical correlation is recommended for coiling
 in the pharynx.
