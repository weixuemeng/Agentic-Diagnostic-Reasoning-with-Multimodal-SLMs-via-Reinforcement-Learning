                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is grossly stable.  Persistent consolidation in the left
 mid lung is consistent with pneumonia.  Right perihilar consolidation is also
 persistent due to pneumonia.  The aeration of the left lower lobe has
 improved.  Small bilateral effusions are stable.  Right upper lobe opacity has
 increased, consistent with increasing infectious process.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema, worsening pneumonia.
