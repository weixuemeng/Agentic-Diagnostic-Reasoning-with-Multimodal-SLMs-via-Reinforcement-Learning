                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of confusion.  Please evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___. CT
 chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath which terminates in the lower SVC.  Streaky
 opacities in the left lower lobe likely reflect known bronchiectasis (as seen
 on prior CT Chest).  There is a new streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region
 which given bronchiectasis in this region raises concern for bronchial mucoid
 imaction though atelectasis/pneumonia cannot be excluded.   There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  Known nodules from metastatic rectal cancer is incompletely
 evaluated on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increase in streaky in the left lower lobe could reflect
 known bronchiectasis with superimposed mucoid impaction. Pneumonia not
 excluded.
