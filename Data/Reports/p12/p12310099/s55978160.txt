                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of cough, currently on chemo for metastatic rectal cancer. 
 Patient with chronic bronchitis at baseline.  Please evaluate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ in ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Right sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC.  There are streacky
 opacities in the left lower lobe likely reflecting known bronchiectasis. 
 There is a consolidation at the medial right lung base likely secondary to
 atelectasis, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 There has been interval improvement of the left lateral lung base
 consolidation compared to the prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. Incompletely
 evaluated are pulmonary nodules subtly visualized in the right lateral lung
 base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle increase in consolidation at the medial right lung base is likely
 secondary to atelectasis however a superimposed infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
