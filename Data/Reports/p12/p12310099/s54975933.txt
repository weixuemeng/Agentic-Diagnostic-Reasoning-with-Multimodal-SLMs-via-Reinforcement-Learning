                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Colon cancer with chills and rigors.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  Increased
 bibasilar opacities could relate to chronic changes as seen on prior chest CT
 with superimposed infectious process.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasilar opacities suspicious for infection
 superimposed on chronic changes including bronchiectasis.  
 
 Recommend short interval imaging follow up after treatment to document
 resolution.
