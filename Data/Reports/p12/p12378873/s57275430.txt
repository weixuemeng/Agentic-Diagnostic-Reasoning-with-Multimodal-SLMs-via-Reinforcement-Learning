                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, hypoxia, COPD  // acute
 process?        Review of prior imaging studies indicates a history a cancer
 involving the right lower lobe, status post CyberKnife treatment finishing on
 ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there is new opacification of the right mid and
 lower zones, likely reflecting a moderately large, right effusion, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  The right heart border is also obscured.  There is vascular
 plethora in the right upper zone which may be secondary to compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  A single surgical clip or fiducial
 is seen at the right lung base medially, with note made of interval change in
 position.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains grossly midline and, where visible,
 is similar to the prior study.
 
 The left lung is grossly clear, without CHF or frank consolidation.  There is
 minimal atelectasis/ scarring at the left lung and possible slight blunting of
 left costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacification of right mid and lower zones, likely reflecting the presence
 of pleural fluid.  The extent of any underlying atelectasis, infection, tumor,
 and the position of the right hemidiaphragm is difficult to assess on this
 examination.  The degree of opacification is also new compared with a chest CT
 from ___.
 
 Vascular plethora in the right upper zone, without evidence of CHF in the left
 lung, likely secondary to compressive atelectasis.
 
 Left base atelectasis and minimal left minimal blunting of left costophrenic
 angle is not significantly unchanged.
