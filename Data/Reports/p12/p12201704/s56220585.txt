                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is increased septal thickening
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  However, when compared to the prior
 chest radiograph, the right hilum is much more pronounced.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominent right hilum.  While this may be due to engorgement of the
 central pulmonary vasculature, its asymmetry when compared to the left hilum
 raises concern for a right hilar mass or adenopathy and further evaluation
 with a contrast enhanced chest CT is recommended.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
