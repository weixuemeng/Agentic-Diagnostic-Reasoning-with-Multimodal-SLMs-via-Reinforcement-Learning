 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the aortic arch. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacity within the lateral aspect of the left
 lung base likely reflects a combination of previously demonstrated scarring or
 fibrosis.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. Previously described pulmonary nodules on CT are not well assessed on
 the current exam. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Previously demonstrated nodules on CT
 are not well visualized on the current exam.
