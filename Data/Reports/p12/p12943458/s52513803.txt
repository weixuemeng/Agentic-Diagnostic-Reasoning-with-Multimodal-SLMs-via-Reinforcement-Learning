                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  f/u abnml cxr ___  // f/u pna      f/u pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Single chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia. Stable severe elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm could be due to paralysis or severe eventration or prior trauma.
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Thoracic aorta is extremely tortuous and heavily
 calcified, but not clearly dilated.
 
 It is hard to tell the severity of interstitial pulmonary abnormality, but
 there may be honeycombing in the right lung.  There has been no interval
 change for the worse, and in fact lung volumes have improved.  Left nipple
 shadow should not be mistaken for a lung nodule.  Despite severe kyphosis
 there is no definite thoracic vertebral compression fracture.
