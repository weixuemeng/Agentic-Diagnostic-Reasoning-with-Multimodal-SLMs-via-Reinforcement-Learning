                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  coughdecr bs LLL  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominent reticular interstitial markings suggest underlying chronic pulmonary
 disease. Mildly increased retrocardiac opacification may represent left lower
 lobe pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Given severe scoliosis and
 kyphosis, comparison to any prior studies (which are not available for review
 at this time) would be useful in assessing for relevant changes. There is
 elevation the right hemidiaphragm, likely related to eventration.There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous and partially
 calcified. There is severe scoliosis, kyphosis, and demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Prominent reticular interstitial markings suggest underlying chronic
 pulmonary disease.
 2. Mildly increased retrocardiac opacification may represent left lower lobe
 pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
 3. Severe scoliosis and kyphosis.
