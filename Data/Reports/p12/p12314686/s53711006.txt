                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with 1 hour of chest pain.  Evaluate
 for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, portable AP dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Linear infrahilar streaky opacities are most consistent
 with atelectasis, although aspiration is possible.  No focal consolidation,
 edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Rounded opacities projecting over the left
 lateral hemithorax on the frontal view could potentially reflect pulmonary
 nodules.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
 appear intact.
 
 The osseous structures appear dense, consistent with history of metastatic
 prostate cancer. Multi-level degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are
 mild.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and atelectasis.
 
 2.  Possible aspiration.
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of edema.
 
 4.  Dense bones, consistent with history of metastatic prostate cancer.
 
 5.  Possible left pulmonary nodules.  Recommend correlation with prior imaging
 not currently available on PACS.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend correlation with prior imaging not currently
 available on PACS to evaluate left pulmonary nodules.
