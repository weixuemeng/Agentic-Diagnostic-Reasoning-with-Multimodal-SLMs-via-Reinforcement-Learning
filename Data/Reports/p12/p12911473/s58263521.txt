                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New endotracheal tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 is at the midclavicular level, approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.  There is increased
 opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable pleural
 effusion.  Whether there has been any mediastinal shift is difficult to assess
 because of the obliquity of the patient.
 
 Hazy opacification at the right base is consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion.
