                                 FINAL REPORT
 TRAUMA CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with an outside hospital chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure activity with intubation, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 6.3 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube is seen extending into the left upper abdomen with its distal
 side-port residing above the GE junction.  Advancement is recommended.  Lung
 volumes are low though lungs appear clear.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube positioned appropriately.  NG tube should be advanced slightly for
 more optimal positioning.  No acute intrathoracic process.
