                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with basilar thrombosis, extensive infarcts,
 and persistent fevers, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 4:15.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.6 cm above the carina.  Left subclavian
 central line has its tip in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 2.  Persistent patchy opacity at both bases with likely associated layering
 effusions, most consistent with compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
