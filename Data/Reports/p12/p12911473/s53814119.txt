                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate NG tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated lordotic positioning.  An ET tube is present, the tip lies
 approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present.  Although the
 tip overlies the gastric fundus immediately beyond the GE junction, the
 sideport is superimposed over the lower mediastinum and does not extend lower
 than the esophagus.  Clips noted in the right upper quadrant. 
 
 There is probable hyperinflation, which could reflect COPD.  There is probable
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is unfolded and mildly tortuous. 
 There is upper zone re-distribution, without definite CHF.  No gross effusion.
 Probable left lower lobe atelectasis.   Vague hazy density overlies the right
 upper lung laterally superimposed over the right fourth posterior rib
 laterally.  This was not visualized on the radiograph of ___, ___ a.m. and
 could represent some superimposed material.  However, attention to this area
 on followup films is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Lines and tubes, as described. The NG sideport does not extend beyond the
 lower esophagus.
 2) Hazy density right upperlung laterally -- please see comment.
