 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath, BNP elevation.  //
 CHF exacerbation?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are lower.  This likely,
 least in part, accounts for slight increased prominence the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse prominence of the
 vascular markings, suggesting CHF.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank
 consolidation or alveolar edema is identified.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, without gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse increased vascular markings likely reflects CHF.  Low inspiratory
 volumes noted.
