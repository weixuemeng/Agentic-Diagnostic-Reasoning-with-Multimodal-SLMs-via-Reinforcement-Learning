                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS  // Infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are linear bibasilar opacities, which likely reflect atelectasis.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear bibasilar opacities, which likely reflects atelectasis, but underlying
 viral, or early bacterial pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
