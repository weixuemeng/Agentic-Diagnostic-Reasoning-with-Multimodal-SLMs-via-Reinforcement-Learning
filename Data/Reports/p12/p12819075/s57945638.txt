                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  PHTN, MOD-SEVERE TR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is hyper
 expansion of the lungs suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
 However, no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion. The biapical pleural thickening is seen, more prominent on the
 right, suggestive of old tuberculous exposure.
