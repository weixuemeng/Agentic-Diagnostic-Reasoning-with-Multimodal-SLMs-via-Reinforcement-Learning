                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.
 
 Of incidental note is a dense opacification seen in the left upper quadrant,
 apparently similar to a posterior collection relative to the stomach that
 could represent a diverticulum with residual barium.
