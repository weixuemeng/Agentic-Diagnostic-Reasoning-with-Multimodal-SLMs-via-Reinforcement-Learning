                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post endotracheal tube and central line
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated same date, ___ approximately 2
 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP supine radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube, its tip which projects within the right bronchial mainstem.
 Retraction approximately 3 cm is advised for more appropriate positioning.  An
 enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip out of the
 field of view.  There is no pneumothorax.  Interval placement of right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is noted, its tip in the mid SVC. 
 Opacification in the retrocardiac region may reflect aspiration new relative
 to prior study.  There is no large pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube low in position within the right mainstem bronchus for
 which repositioning and retraction 3 cm is advised.
 2.  Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter
 without evidence of pneumothorax though technique is suboptimal in the
 detection of pneumothorax.
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity is new relative to prior study, likely aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 7:___ PM, 1 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
