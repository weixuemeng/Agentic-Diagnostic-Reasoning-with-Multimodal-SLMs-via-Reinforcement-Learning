                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  Overlying EKG
 leads are present.  There is mediastinal widening which could reflect
 technique, though underlying mediastinal abnormality cannot be excluded. 
 Irregular nodularity in the right upper lobe appears grossly stable from
 ___ radiograph.  There is increased reticular opacity in the lower lungs
 bilaterally which may in part represent atelectasis, though the possibility of
 fibrotic changes not excluded.  There is no convincing sign of pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is normal.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 Degenerative changes are again seen at the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mediastinal prominence likely in part attributable to technique,
 though the possibility of mediastinal pathology not excluded.  Consider
 dedicated PA and lateral views to better assess.  Reticular opacity in the
 right upper lung appears grossly stable from prior exam and likely represents
 a focus of scarring.  No convincing signs of pneumonia or CHF.
