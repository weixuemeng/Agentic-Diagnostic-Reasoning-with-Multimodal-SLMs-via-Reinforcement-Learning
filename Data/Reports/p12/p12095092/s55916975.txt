                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and bibasilar crackles with history of COPD and respiratory
 failure.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.   
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs appear hyperexpanded suggesting underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  No focal consolidations are identified.  Multifocal scarring is
 noted in the right upper and mid lung along with bilateral foci of bronchial
 wall thickening. Cardiac silhouette appears stable at upper limits of normal. 
 The thoracic aorta is tortuous but stable.  The pulmonary arteries again
 appear enlarged suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is no
 pleural effusion.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
