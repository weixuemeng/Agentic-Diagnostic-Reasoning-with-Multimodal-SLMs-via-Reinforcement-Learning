                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Intubated.  Evaluate ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the
 carina.  An upper enteric tube courses through the esophagus into the stomach
 and off of the radiograph.  Perihilar haziness represents ground-glass
 opacities, better characterized on the prior CT torso performed the same day. 
 The pulmonary arteries are enlarged.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  Right
 perihilar ground-glass opacities could represent aspiration or infection.
