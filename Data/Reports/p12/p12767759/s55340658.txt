 HISTORY:  Syncopal episode last night.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable, as are the hila contours.  No displaced fracture is seen.  The
 focus of superior right lower lobe opacity seen on subsequent chest CT is not
 appreciated on this less sensitive study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
