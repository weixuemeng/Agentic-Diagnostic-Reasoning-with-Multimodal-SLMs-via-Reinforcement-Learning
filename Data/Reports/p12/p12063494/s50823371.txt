 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion.  Previously
 present asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities appear more
 symmetrically distributed on today's examination and are predominantly in the
 perihilar and basilar regions.  Left retrocardiac opacity and adjacent small
 pleural effusions appear unchanged.
