 pulmonary edema, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged, and in the
 setting of normal pulmonary vessels, could represent cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion.  Calcification of the aortic arch is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with normal oulmonary vessels could
