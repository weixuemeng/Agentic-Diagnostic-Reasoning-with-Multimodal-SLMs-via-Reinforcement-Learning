 dialysis.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is again noted.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Although there is mild
 elevation of central venous pressures, no overt pulmonary edema is present. 
 Hazy opacity within the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly elevated central venous pressures in the setting of moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly, but without overt pulmonary edema.
