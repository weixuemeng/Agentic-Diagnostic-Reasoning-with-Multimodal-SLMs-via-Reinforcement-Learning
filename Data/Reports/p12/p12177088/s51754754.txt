                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for minimal right basal opacity, most likely representing vessel
 end on or small less than 3 mm pulmonary nodule.  Comparison with prior
 studies is recommended if available.  If not, followup of the patient with
 chest radiograph in three months for assessment of stability is recommended.
