                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation  // eval ett tube placement     
 eval ett tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm terminating in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, likely within the stomach. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely
 within normal limits. There is a right basilar opacity greater than left
 basilar opacity and blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may
 represent a combination of right pleural effusion and atelectasis although
 aspiration is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar atelectasis or aspiration
 on the right worse than the left.  Possible small right pleural effusion.
