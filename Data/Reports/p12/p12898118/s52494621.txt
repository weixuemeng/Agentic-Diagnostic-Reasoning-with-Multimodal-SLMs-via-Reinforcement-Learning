  1. New endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm the carina should be advanced 2-3
  cm for optimal placement.
  2. New enteric tube terminates within the proximal stomach and should be
  advanced at least 3 cm for optimal positioning of the side port.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p intubation, evaluate positions ETT and NGT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube
 terminates within the proximal stomach with the side port at approximately the
 level of the GE junction.  Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma is limited
 by exclusion of the left chest from the field of view.  The visualized lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm the carina and may be advanced 2-3
 cm for optimal placement.
 2. New enteric tube terminates within the proximal stomach and may be advanced
 at least 3 cm for optimal positioning of the side port.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Enteric and endotracheal tube should be advanced
 approximately 3 cm for optimal positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:31 AM, 2 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
