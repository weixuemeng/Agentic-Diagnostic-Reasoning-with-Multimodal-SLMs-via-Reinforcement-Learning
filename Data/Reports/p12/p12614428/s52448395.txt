                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  L posterior rib pain after fall ___, Decreased BS L base,
 pleuritic pain  // r/o L pleural effusion      r/o L pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Atelectasis at the right lung base explains elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lateral view shows blunting of one
 of the posterior sulci, due to the small effusion, but the side is
 indeterminate.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  Thoracic
 vertebrae and disc space heights are maintained.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
