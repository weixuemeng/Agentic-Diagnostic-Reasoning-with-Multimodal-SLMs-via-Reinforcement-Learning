                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema noted.  Left basilar
 opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm persists, and may
 reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Minimal linear opacities in the
 right lung base also reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with anterior bridging osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left lower lobe opacity which could reflect atelectasis though
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
