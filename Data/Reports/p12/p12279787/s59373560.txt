                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal
 contour is similar.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated with mild prominence of pulmonary vascular markings in the left
 lung, potentially suggestive of asymmetric mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Consolidative opacity in the left lung base is new in the interval.  Patchy
 opacity in the right lung base is also noted.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions have developed.  No pneumothorax is present.  Cervical spinal fusion
 hardware is incompletely assessed.  Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New consolidative opacity in the left lung base, potentially atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration remain in the differential.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and right basilar atelectasis.
 3. Mild asymmetric pulmonary vascular congestion.
