                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, lightheaded, question cardiopulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Lordotic positioning on AP.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, but doubt overt CHF.  However, there is increased opacity
 over the lower thoracic spine with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm
 posteriorly, which could reflect a focal lower lobe infiltrate.  There is also
 increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Small posterior effusions cannot be excluded.  Incidental note is made of
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  At the edge of these films, fixation
 hardware in the cervical spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Possible lower lobe consolidation, ? on left.
