 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with subdural hematoma, now febrile.  Suspect

 Very slight change in the extent of opacification in the right mid lung could
 represent a very early pneumonia, exaggerated by RPO positioning.  Followup
 advised.  Lungs are otherwise clear of any focal abnormality.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists, but there is no appreciable pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion and heart size is top normal.  Right internal jugular line
 ends in the low SVC, left central line in the upper.  An upper enteric
 drainage tube ends in mid portion of a non-distended stomach.
