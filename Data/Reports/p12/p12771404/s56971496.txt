                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ status post craniotomy, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 4:16 a.m. and allowing for differences in technique,
 there has been slight retraction of the NG tube tip.Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is an NG-type tube with tip overlying the gastric fundus, slightly
 higher than the prior film.  Also again seen is a left subclavian central line
 tip over mid SVC.  Right-sided indwelling catheter tip overlies the distal
 SVC.  The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic aortic valve. 
 Opacity overlying the lower spine is compatible with vertebro- or kyphoplasty.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is evidence for
 diffuse parenchymal scarring.  There is atelectasis and/or scarring at both
 bases.  No frank consolidation or effusion is identified.  No definite CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight retraction of the NG tube tip.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change compared with ___ at 4:16 a.m.
