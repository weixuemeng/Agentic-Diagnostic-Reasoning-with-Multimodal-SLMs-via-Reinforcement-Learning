                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB and mild feve rpls eval for pna  //
 History: ___M with SOB and mild feve rpls eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive, heavy, left-sided pleural calcification extending along
 the full extent of the left hemithorax, particularly laterally, and appears to
 involve the left costophrenic angle, and with left lung volume loss. Slight
 blunting left costophrenic angle is felt to likely be due to pleural
 thickening. No focal consolidation is seen on the right. Slight prominence of
 the right hilum is noted. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided fibrothorax. Given given reported prior history of pulmonary
 tuberculosis fibrothorax may be due to history of tuberculous pleuritis.
 Differential diagnosis would also include a history of prior infection/empyema
 or hematoma. Mediastinal pleura appears spared, however correlate with prior
 imaging to document long-term stability, and if none, need for outpatient CT.
 
 Mildly prominent right hilum most likely due to prominent pulmonary vessels
 however, nonurgent chest CT could be obtained to assess for underlying
 lymphadenopathy.
