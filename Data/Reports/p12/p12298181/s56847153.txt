                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for right pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite
 pneumothorax at this time.  There could be a small collection of air in the
 apical region that is obscured by overlying bony structures.
 
 Otherwise, there is still evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and small
 fluid collections at the bases.
