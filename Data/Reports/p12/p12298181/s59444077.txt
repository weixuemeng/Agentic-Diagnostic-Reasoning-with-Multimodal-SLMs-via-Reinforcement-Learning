                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to right base opacity, but is
 grossly stable since the prior study, mildly to moderately enlarged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right-sided weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Again seen are bilateral perihilar opacities, with
 prominent interstitial markings in both lungs, consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  More confluent consolidations in the right infrahilar
 region, may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, or underlying consolidation.  A moderate-sized right
 pleural effusion is present.  A small left pleural effusion is likely present.
 Multiple sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips indicate prior CABG.  Multiple
 intact sternotomy wires are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema with right pleural effusion.  More
 confluent opacities in the right lung base, could be due to combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, possible asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 underlying consolidation from infection, aspiration, hemorrhage not excluded.
