                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Suggest HCC with fatigue decrease in uptake.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Of note the lateral view is
 limited significantly with the arms being down over the chest.  The lungs are
 low in volume with bibasilar opacities, which given lung volumes are likely
 atelectasis.  The appearance of bronchovascular crowding is most likely due to
 lung volumes as well, though trace edema is impossible to exclude.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes limiting assessment without acute process. 
 Basilar opacities are most likely atelectasis given low lung volumes. Trace
 edema cannot be excluded given low lung volumes.
