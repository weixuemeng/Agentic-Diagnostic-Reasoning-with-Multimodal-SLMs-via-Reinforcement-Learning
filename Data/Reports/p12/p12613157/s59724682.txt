                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified
 and perhaps mildly ectatic.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 right perihilar opacity, not well seen on the lateral view but probably
 involving the right upper lobe, is suggestive of pneumonia, although not
 entirely a specific finding.  Aside from streaky opacities in the right lower
 lung, otherwise the lung fields appear fairly clear.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lung opacity suggesting pneumonia.  However,
 coinciding malignancy, or malignancy mimicking pneumonia, should be excluded
 by performing short-term follow-up radiography within six to eight weeks in
 order to show resolution of the finding.
