 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes. Linear bibasilar opacities are seen
 which may relate to atelectasis although developing infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with linear bibasilar opacities likely representing
 atelectasis, underlying infectious process not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
