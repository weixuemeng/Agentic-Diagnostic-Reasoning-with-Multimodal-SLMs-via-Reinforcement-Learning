                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Ill-defined streaky opacity
 in the right lower lobe is new compared to the prior exam, and could reflect
 an area of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right lower lobe may reflect an area of
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical context.
