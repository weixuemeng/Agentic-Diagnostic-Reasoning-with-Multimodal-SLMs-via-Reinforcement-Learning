                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view.  The costophrenic angles
 are fully included on the image.  Given this, the lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
