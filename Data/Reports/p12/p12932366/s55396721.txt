 As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have decreased. As a
 consequence, the radiodensity of the lung bases have also increased. However,
 there is a minimal zone of radiodense lung at the right lung bases.  This zone
 could represent developing pneumonia and should be followed.  No larger
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 The patient has been intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects
 approximately 4 cm above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices
 are constant.
