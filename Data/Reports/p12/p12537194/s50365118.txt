 pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is further filling of the right
 hemithorax with fluid with pneumothorax above it.  Mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels on the left again could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  More coalescent opacification is seen in the right upper
 zone.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent development
 of superimposed pneumonia.
