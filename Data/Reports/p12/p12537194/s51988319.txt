                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest tube, assess for improvement in effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 08:30, chest CT ___ at
 09:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right basilar chest tube.  There is
 persistent large right pleural effusion, minimally decreased in size compared
 to the prior study, with now a small amount of air in the pleural space noted
 at the right apex.  There is continued leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures, though the degree of shift has slightly decreased in the interval.
 No pulmonary edema is present.  Multiple nodular opacities are noted within
 the left lung, better assessed on the prior chest CT.  Osseous structures
 demonstrate a diffusely mottled appearance compatible with widespread
 metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Status post right basilar chest tube placement.  Minimal decrease in size
 of the large right pleural effusion with slight decrease in leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures and interval development of a small right pneumothorax.
 2.  Innumerable left lung nodules and osseous metastatic lesions, better
 visualized on recent chest CT.
