                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, dyspnea, tachypnea x months, now worse
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the right hemi thorax with leftward
 deviation of mediastinal structures compatible with a large right pleural
 effusion.  The heart size is difficult to assess, but appears to be mildly
 enlarged.  Left lung is hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  There
 appears to be tiny nodular opacities noted throughout the left lung.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous structures appear diffusely mottled with
 several lucent expansile lesions in the right lateral ribs.  S shaped
 scoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Complete opacification of the right hemi thorax with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures most compatible with a large right pleural effusion.
 2. Scattered osseous lesions and tiny nodular opacities in the left lung
 concerning for metastatic disease.
