 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough and suspected
 aspiration.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance including
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery that might be consistent with
 pulmonary hypertension.  Lungs are essentially clear with no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No evidence of aspiration or pneumonia is demonstrated on
 the current study.  Repeated radiograph if patient's symptoms persist might be
 considered.
