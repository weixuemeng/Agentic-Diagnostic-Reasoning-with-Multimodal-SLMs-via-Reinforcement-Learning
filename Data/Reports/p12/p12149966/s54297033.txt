                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right costophrenic angle is not included on the given view.  Endotracheal
 tube is in appropriate position.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Central
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present without frank interstitial edema. 
 The right hilus appears asymmetrically prominent.  Lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial
 edema.  The right hilus is asymmetrically prominent, raising the possibility
 of pneumonia of the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Possible right lower lobe pneumonia can be further
 investigated with a lateral chest radiograph, if feasible.
