 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AMS, now intubated for airway protection  //
 eval for pna, ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph from earlier the same date,
 pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  A nonspecific right lower lobe
 opacity has minimally worsened, and could potentially be due to infectious

 for small left pleural effusion and new adjacent atelectasis in the left lung
 base.
