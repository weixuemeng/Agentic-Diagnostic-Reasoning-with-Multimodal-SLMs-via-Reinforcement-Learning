                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion, on hemodialysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, new compared to the
 prior chest radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Linear
 opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted. 
 Compression deformity of a mid/ lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
