                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild prominence of the interstitial markings, suggesting minimal interstitial
 edema, although the possibility of underlying chronic lung disease is also
 raised.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight prominence of the interstitial markings may be due to
 interstitial edema, appears slightly increased since the prior study.
