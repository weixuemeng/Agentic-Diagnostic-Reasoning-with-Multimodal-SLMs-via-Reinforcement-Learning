                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with concern for stroke, and dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy
 opacities are seen within both lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis/
 scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Compression deformities of a couple of low thoracic vertebral bodies
 appear unchanged from prior CT.  Clips from prior cholecystectomy are noted in
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There is chronic elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities
 likely reflective of atelectasis/scarring.
