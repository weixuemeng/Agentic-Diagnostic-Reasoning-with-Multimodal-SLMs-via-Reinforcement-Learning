                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded without focal airspace opacity to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is mild pleural thickening at the lung apices,
 likely chronic scarring.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
