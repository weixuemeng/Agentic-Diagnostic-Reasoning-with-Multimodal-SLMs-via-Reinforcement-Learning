                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 The lungs are fully expanded and clear, but thickening of the right lower
 paratracheal stripe and effacement of the aortopulmonic window in the
 mediastinum suggest central adenopathy, which may also be responsible for mild
 tubulation of the left main bronchus.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is
 no displacement of the stomach or splenic flexure to suggest appreciable
 cardiomegaly.
 
 In the absence of any radiographic evidence of pneumonia, the lymph nodes
 cannot be considered reactive.  Differential diagnosis therefore includes
 sarcoidosis, as well as either lymphoproliferative or other malignancy.  Some
 medications can also elicit central adenopathy, particularly Dilantin.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned.
