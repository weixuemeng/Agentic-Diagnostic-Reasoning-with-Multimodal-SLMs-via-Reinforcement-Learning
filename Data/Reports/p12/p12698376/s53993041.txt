                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress, question infection versus fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to portable chest radiograph performed on
 ___, three hours prior.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Evaluation is limited due to patient motion as
 well as rotation.  Improved perihilar interstitial opacities likely reflecting
 diuresis of pulmonary edema.  Persistent left perihilar opacity likely
 reflects combination of residual edema and rotational component. Improved
 aeration of the right lung base, though a residual opacity may be due to a
 small pleural effusion or motion artifact.  Stable mediastinal and cardiac
 contours present.  Stable positioning of AICD.  No pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significantly mproved pulmonary edema with no focal opacification
 concerning for pneumonia.  Persistent left perihilar and right lung base
 opacities may reflect minimal residual edema/small effusion respectively or
 artifact given exam limitations. Suggest repeat chest radiograph after further
 diuresis.
