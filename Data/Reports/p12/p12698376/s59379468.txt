                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress. 
 Question pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates patient rotated to
 the right.  There is a right pectoral pacemaker AICD with at least three leads
 terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and what appears to be
 coronary sinus.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  There is
 mild unfolding of the descending aorta.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen
 in the aortic arch.  There is new perihilar interstitial edema. More confluent
 opacity at the right base could be a combination of edema, atelectasis, and a
 small effusion, or, alternatively pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: New pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion with
 concurrent atelectasis. Suggest followup radiograph after treatment of heart
 failure to evaluate possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
