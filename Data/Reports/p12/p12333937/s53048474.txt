 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post OLT with nausea, diarrhea, dysuria and
 diffusion, there is oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Small right pleural effusion has increased. 
 Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.  Increasing right perihilar
 and lower lobe opacities are most likely due to atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
