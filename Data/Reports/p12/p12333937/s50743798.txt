                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a better inspiration.  That and the fact that the patient is upright
 most likely account for the apparent decreased opacification at the right
 base.  On the lateral view, there is opacification posteriorly indicating that
 there has been redistribution of pleural fluid with some volume loss at the
 right base.  Central catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
 
 There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
