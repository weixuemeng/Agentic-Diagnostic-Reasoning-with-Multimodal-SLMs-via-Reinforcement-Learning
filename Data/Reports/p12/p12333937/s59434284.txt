 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:10 PM
  Little change in comparison to the prior study from the day before with a
  stable opacity again noted at the right cardiophrenic sulcus. While pnumonia
  must be excluded in the proper clinical setting, this opacity is most
  suggestive of a pleural effusion, possibly loculated. Mild left basilar
  atelectasis with no acute cardiopulmonary process otherwise noted.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Ascites status post tap.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small
 right pleural effusion has minimally increased.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  Persistent opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle is likely
 atelectasis.  Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
