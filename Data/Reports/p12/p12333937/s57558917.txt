                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  History of hepatitis C cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is new opacification in the right costophrenic sulcus which suggests
 atelectasis or perhaps loculated effusion which is new since ___.  Slight
 scarring in the right upper lung appears unchanged.  Slight thickening along
 the right major fissure.  Opacity obscuring the right posterior hemidiaphragm
 is probably due to atelectasis and perhaps a very small residual pleural
 effusion.  Osteophytes are similar along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity obscuring the right costophrenic sulcus, suggesting
 atelectasis or perhaps loculated pleural fluid, but otherwise clear lungs; an
 infectious process is difficult to exclude at the medial right lung base.
