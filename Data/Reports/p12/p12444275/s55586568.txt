                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left lung mass and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 15:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Ill-defined mass within the left lower lobe is re-
 demonstrated, but poorly assessed.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Deformity of the left proximal humerus suggest remote fracture.  Irregularity
 of the right-sided ribs is better assessed on the previous radiograph,
 concerning for osseous metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and low lung volumes.  Left lower lobe lung
 mass is not well assessed on the current exam.  Retrocardiac patchy opacity,
 likely atelectasis.  Irregularity of the right-sided ribs concerning for
 osseous metastases.
