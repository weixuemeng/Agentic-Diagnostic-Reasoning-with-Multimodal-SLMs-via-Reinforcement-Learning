                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M hx of lung cancer, volume overload w/respiratory
 distress and s/p intubation.  // assess ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier today, the patient has been
 intubated, with endotracheal tube terminating 1 cm above the carinal with the
 neck in a flexed position.  This could be withdrawn several cm for standard
 positioning.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening bibasilar opacities,
 persistent large left lower lobe mass, persistent left and increasing right
 pleural effusions.  No other relevant changes since recent study of several hr
 earlier.
