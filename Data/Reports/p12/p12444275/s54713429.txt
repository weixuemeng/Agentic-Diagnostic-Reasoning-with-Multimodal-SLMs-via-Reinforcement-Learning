 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes continue to be very
 low.  Moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions persists. 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  A parenchymal opacity and the level of the
 left hilus should be kept on the close radiographic observation, to exclude
 the possibility of developing pneumonia.
