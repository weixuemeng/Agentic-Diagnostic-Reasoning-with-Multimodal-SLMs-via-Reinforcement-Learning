                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with fever, evaluate for infection..
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 AP and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen, is volume loss within the right hemi thorax with diffuse, smoothly
 marginated right pleural thickening and or loculated fluid. As compared to
 scout image from chest see CT of ___, the amount of pleural
 fluid posteriorly appears increased as well as worsening in the extent of
 right lower lobe opacification with configuration suggestive of collapse. The
 heart is normal in size.  There is no the left lung is clear. Deformity from
 prior left rib fractures are noted. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fibrothorax on the right, with apparent worsening of loculated right pleural
 effusion and adjacent right lower lobe collapse. CT of the chest would be
 helpful for more complete evaluation of these complex pleural and parenchymal
 abnormalities, especially considering the clinical concern for infection.
