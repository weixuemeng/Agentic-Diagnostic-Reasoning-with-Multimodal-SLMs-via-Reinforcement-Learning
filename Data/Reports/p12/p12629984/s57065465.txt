                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is the suggestion of some
 increased opacification at the right base medially.  This could reflect mild
 atelectatic changes with crowding of vessels relating to poor inspiration. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, developing consolidation would
 have to be considered.
