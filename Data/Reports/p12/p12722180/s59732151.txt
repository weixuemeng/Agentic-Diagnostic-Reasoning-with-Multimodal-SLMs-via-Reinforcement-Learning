                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? PNA  // please repeat given poor
 inspiration on prior film -- WBC ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 11:20.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior chest radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. 
 Persistent crowding of vessels at the bases bilaterally.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes with crowding of vessels at the bases bilaterally,
 limiting assessment of the lung bases.  Standard PA and lateral radiographs of
 the chest with improved inspiratory level would be helpful for more complete
 assessment when the patient's condition permits.
