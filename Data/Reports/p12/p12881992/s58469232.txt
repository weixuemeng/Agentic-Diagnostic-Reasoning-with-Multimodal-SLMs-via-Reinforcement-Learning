                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Decreased PO intake, tachycardia, and schizophrenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lung apices
 are somewhat obscured by overlying hair on the frontal view.  Projecting over
 the course of the anterior right fifth rib as well as the right mid lung is a
 nodular focus, possibly a bone island or nipple shadow. Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Small nodular focus projecting over the course of the right fifth rib and
 lung, nipple shadow versus bone island, although a pulmonary nodule is not
 excluded.
