                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MVC w/ C6 fracture intubated after developing respiratory
 failure now s/p C5-C7 anterior fusion c/b neck swelling s/p takeback and
 washout; revision of anterior fusion, emergent posterior decompression fusion
 for cord compression  // interval change - eval pleural effusion on CT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased left-sided airspace opacity likely represents a combination of
 increasing left pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis or collapse. 
 Pneumonia is possible in the proper clinical setting.  Mild volume overload is
 unchanged.  The tracheostomy tube ends 6.8 cm from the carina.  The right lung
 is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased left-sided opacity is likely a combination of increasing left
 pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
 2. Unchanged mild volume overload.
