                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is persistent mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There are
 probably small bilateral pleural effusions.  Minimal vague opacity projects
 over the right upper lung, similar to the prior appearance, although more
 generalized opacification was present on the prior examination.  Compared to
 earlier radiographs, this area of opacity is similar and so may be a more
 chronic process.  Lines, tubes and drains have been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the right upper lobe, although potentially
 chronic.  If there is clinical concern for pneumonia, short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful.  Very small suspected pleural effusions.
