                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of desaturation, increased oxygen requirement.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sighted PIC line terminates in the mid SVC.  There is an NG
 tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis has increased compared to the prior exam.  There is
 bilateral perihilar vascular congestion with overall increase in
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity at the right lung base is
 also concerning for possible aspiration/pneumonia.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacity at the right lung base is concerning for
 aspiration/pneumonia.
 
 2.  Interval increase in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
