                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left internal jugular central
 line placed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central
 venous catheter with tip projecting over the right atrium.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Redemonstration of vague opacity within the right upper
 lung is again noted and is more apparent on this exam.  The technique is
 somewhat different; this film is somewhat more blurry.  Vague opacity is also
 seen at the right lung base, probably atelectasis.  Probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted.  Heart size is unchanged.  There is no evidence
 of pneumoperitoneum and osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interval placement of right-sided central venous catheter with tip
 projecting over the right atrium without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  More conspicuous opacity in the right upper lobe, a possible developing
 infectious process but potentially the apparent increase is due to differences
 in technique.
