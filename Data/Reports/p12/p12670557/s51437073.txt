                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ventral hernia repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 5.6 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube and left subclavian catheter are essentially
 unchanged.  Otherwise, there is little overall change in the diffuse
 opacifications involving both lungs as on the previous study.
