                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest tightness.  Evaluation for
 cardiomegaly or other pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  A slight contour abnormality is noted posterior to the
 left ventricle on the lateral view, in the expected location of the inferior
 vena cava.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 pulmonary edema, or focal airspace consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Contour abnormality along the
 inferior heart border, posterior to the left ventricle on the lateral view, is
 likely due to pericardial cyst or herniation of subdiaphragmatic fat. 
 Correlation with prior chest radiographs is recommended if available.  If no
 prior imaging is available, follow up PA and lateral radiographs are
 recommended in 3 months to ensure stability.
