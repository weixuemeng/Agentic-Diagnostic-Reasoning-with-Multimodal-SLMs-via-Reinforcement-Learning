                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of aspiration secondary to achalasia comes in after vomiting
 with question pneumonia versus pneumonitis on admission chest x-ray, now
 appears very well.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been considerable interval improvement
 in the previously seen right base opacity.  Some residual opacity is present,
 though substantially improved.  Again seen is slight retraction of the right
 minor fissure, consistent with volume loss in the right upper zone, similar to
 the prior film.  
 
 There is some patchy opacity in the right upper zone, with right apical
 pleural thickening, unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.  Minimal
 pleural parenchymal scarring at the left lung apex and mild patchy opacity at
 the left base are also unchanged. 
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, probably unchanged. There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  No gross effusions are identified.
 
 Probable hyperinflation consistent with COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Substantial interval improvement in right base opacity, with minimal
 residual opacity noted.  This could reflect a resolving area of pneumonitis.
 2.  Suspect some patchy opacity in the right upper zone, unchanged.  This is
 new compared with ___.  Attention to this area on followup films is
 requested.  Some apical scarring and volume loss is also noted in the right
 upper lobe.
 3.  Left apical scarring and minimal patchy opacity/atelectasis at left lung
 base is unchanged.
