                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal,
 hilar, and cardiac contours.  There is retrocardiac opacification with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, likely represents combination of atelectasis and layering pleural
 effusion, though cannot exclude underlying consolidation due to pneumonia. 
 Slightly increased patchy opacity in the right lower lung may represent
 atelectasis, though again cannot exclude infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, likely represents combination of
 atelectasis and layering pleural effusion, but exclude underlying
 consolidation/pneumonia.  Slightly increased opacification of the right lower
 lung may also represent atelectasis and vascular structures, though cannot
 exclude an infectious process.
