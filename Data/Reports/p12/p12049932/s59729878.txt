                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  IV drug use, MRSA bacteremia and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central
 venous catheter, left PICC, endotracheal tube and enteric tube.  There has
 been interval reduction in large area of opacification projecting over the
 right lung with scattered patchy opacities remaining on the right and to a
 lesser extent on the left.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 and a small right pleural effusion is present.  No definite overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable,
 although there is slight prominence of the hila which may be due to underlying
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in pulmonary opacities as compared to the prior
 study with persistent scattered patchy opacities in the lungs, right side
 greater than left, worrisome for multifocal infection.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
