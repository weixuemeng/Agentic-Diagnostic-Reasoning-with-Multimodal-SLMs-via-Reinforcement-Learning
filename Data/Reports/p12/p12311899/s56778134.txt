                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stroke  // rule out pneumonia      rule out
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The heart is normal in size and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Rounded
 opacification is seen in the subdiaphragmatic area on the left. This probably
 represents a calcified mass of uncertain etiology. If further characterization
 of the lesion is required, CT would be the next imaging study.
