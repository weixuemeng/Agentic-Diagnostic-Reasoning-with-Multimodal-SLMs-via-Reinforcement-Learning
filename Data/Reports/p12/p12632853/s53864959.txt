                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller today than it was on ___,
 both posterior and lateral costal components.  There is still unexplained
 nearly 3-cm wide oval opacity projecting over the right lower lung laterally. 
 Conceivably, this is a pleural loculation, or even rounded atelectasis, but
 unless the nature of the right pleural effusion is fully understood, I would
 recommend a CT scan for its assessment.  There is also a new triangular region
 of consolidation in the right lung, either in the superior segment of the
 lower lobe or posterior segment of the right upper lobe but on the frontal
 view projecting over the right third anterior rib, just lateral to the midline
 of the right hemithorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding.  Left lung is
 grossly clear.  Many vascular clips project over the right upper abdomen.
