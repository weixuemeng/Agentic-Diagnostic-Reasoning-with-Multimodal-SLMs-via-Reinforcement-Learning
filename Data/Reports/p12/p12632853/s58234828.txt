                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pleural effusion.  Evaluate for increase in pleural
 fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 There are bilateral diffuse fine reticular opacities, more pronounced in the
 right lung base, which are not significantly changed from the previous exam
 although the patient did not have interstitial disease in the previous CT from
 ___.  Mild right-sided pleural thickening in the lower lung is
 unchanged.  Stable blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with
 scarring. Compared with the previous examination, there is interval increase
 in size of left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Multiple surgical ___ in the upper abdomen were reidentified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase of left-sided pleural effusion from ___.
 
 2.  Fine reticular opacities are unchanged from the previous radiograph.
 However, given the absence of interstitial lung disease in the previous exam,
 further assessment with non contrast CT chest (HRCT protocol) is warranted.
