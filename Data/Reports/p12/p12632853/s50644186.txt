                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF here with cough, weakness and extremity
 edema.  // ? PICC placement, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval decrease in pulmonary edema,
 which is now mild.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, and decreased
 since prior.  More focal right base opacity could relate to combination of
 mild pulmonary edema and pleural effusion, but consolidation is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
 
 Right-sided catheter is seen terminating in the right axilla ; if this is a
 midline catheter it may be in appropriate position, if it is a PICC, it is not
 in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided catheter terminates in the right axilla ; if this is a midline
 catheter it may be in appropriate position, if it is a PICC, it is not in
 appropriate position.
 
 Interval decrease in pulmonary edema, which is now mild.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions again seen, decreased from prior.
 
 More focal right base opacity could relate to combination of mild pulmonary
 edema and pleural effusion, but consolidation not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
