                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pleural effusion, here for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate mildly prominent
 cardiac silhouette.  Atherosclerotic arch calcifications are noted.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The left lung is
 clear of confluent consolidation or pleural effusion.  A tiny focus of opacity
 in the lateral left upper lobe corresponds with a focus of linear opacity on
 CT dated ___, suggestive of chronic infection/inflammation.  In the
 right lung, streaky right upper lobe opacities persist, which also likely
 reflect chronic change.  There is trace if any small right pleural effusion,
 with a persistent rounded right costophrenic contour, previously confirmed to
 be rounded atelectasis on CT.  Surgical ___ are seen in the
 subdiaphragmatic location.  Multilevel lower thoracic wedge compression
 deformities are unchanged as compared to prior CT from ___. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right greater than left upper lobe linear opacities likely
 reflect chronic post infectious or inflammatory changes.
 
 2.  Persistent rounded atelectasis in the right costophrenic angle.
