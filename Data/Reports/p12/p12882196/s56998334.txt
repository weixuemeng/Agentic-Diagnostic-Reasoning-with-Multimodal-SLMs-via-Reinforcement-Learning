                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Question wide mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The contour of the aortic arch is prominent with calcification and
 tortuosity, but otherwise the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 There is patchy left basilar opacity, which can probably be ascribed to
 atelectasis.  Lesser right infrahilar opacity is probably also due to minor
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat prominent aortic arch which may constitute aneurysmal
 dilatation.  Chest CT should be considered to evaluate further when clinically
 appropriate although findings are unlikely to account for acute presentation.
