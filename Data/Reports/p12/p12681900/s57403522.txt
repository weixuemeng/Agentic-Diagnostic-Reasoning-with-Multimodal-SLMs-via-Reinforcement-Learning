  1. Standard position of the endotracheal tube.
  
  2. Side port of the nasogastric tube lies above the gastroesophageal junction
  and should be advanced approximately 7 cm for optimal positioning.
  
  3. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration is not
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, transfer for angioedema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube tip is below the gastroesophageal junction, though the side
 port is within the distal esophagus.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes and is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are prominent due to supine positioning and low lung volumes.  There
 is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is
 noted.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal tube.
 
 2. Side port of the nasogastric tube lies above the gastroesophageal junction
 and should be advanced approximately 7 cm for optimal positioning.
 
 3. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration is not
 excluded.
