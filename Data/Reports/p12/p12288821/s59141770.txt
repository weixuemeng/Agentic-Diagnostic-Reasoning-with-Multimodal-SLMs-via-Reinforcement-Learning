 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive multifocal
 opacities have substantially decreased.  However, a right upper lobe opacity
 with air bronchograms is still clearly visible and likely to correspond to
 pneumonia.
 
 No evidence of pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
