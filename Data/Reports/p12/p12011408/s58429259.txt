                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right flank tenderness.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Linear opacities in the lung bases are
 compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  No displaced rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No displaced rib fracture visualized.  If
 there is continued concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series can
 be obtained.
