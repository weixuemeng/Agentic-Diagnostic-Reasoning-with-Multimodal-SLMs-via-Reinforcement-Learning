                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and GNR bacteremia  // assess for PNA
 and pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to previous chest x-rays dating from ___ with the most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly and mildly widened mediastinum which is likely
 exaggerated by low lung volumes and appears stable when compared to prior
 studies.  There is opacification in the retrocardiac space that appears stable
 when compared to prior studies but in the appropriate clinical setting could
 represent pneumonia.  There is a linear opacification left upper lobe which
 represents atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged opacification in the retrocardiac space that in the appropriate
 clinical setting could represent pneumonia.
 2. Linear atelectasis in the left upper lobe.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema.
