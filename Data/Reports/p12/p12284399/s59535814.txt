                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A large, left unilateral pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse are
 present without appreciable mediastinal shift.  A linear streak of atelectasis
 or scarring is noted in the right mid lung.  Both apices are clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No distracted bony fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large unilateral left pleural effusion appears to be chronic due to lack of
 mediastinal shift. Comparison to prior chest examinations would be helpful. 
 Consideration should be given to hemothorax if there is a positive trauma
 history with other possibilities including infection or malignancy.
