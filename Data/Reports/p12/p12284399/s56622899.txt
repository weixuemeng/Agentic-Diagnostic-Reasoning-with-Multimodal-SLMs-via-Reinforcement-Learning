                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tubes remain in place, with no visible
 pneumothorax.  Interval extubation.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance allowing for lower lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present as well as persistent left retrocardiac atelectasis and
 moderate left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is also similar.
