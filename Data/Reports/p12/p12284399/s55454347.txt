                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of loculated effusion status post left
 VATS decortication.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of a left
 transjugular central venous catheter and a left-sided chest tube in the
 interim.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by AP technique and low lung
 volumes.  There is increased right sided atelectasis.  Vague left apical
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis, minimally increased since prior exams. 
 Dense retrocardiac opacities persist, compatible with atelectasis.  There is a
 moderate left pleural effusion.  The right lung is well aerated.  There is no
 discernible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of a left central line and a chest tube.  
 
 2.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion, with
 increased right atelectasis.
