                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath on exertion and history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The heart is at
 the upper limits of normal size with a left ventricular configuration, as
 before.  Streaky opacities in the right upper and left lower lung suggesting
 minor scarring appear unchanged.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There
 are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax; persistent effacement of
 the left costophrenic angle is probably due to chronic scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
