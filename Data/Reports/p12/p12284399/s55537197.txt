                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  VATS washout, three chest tubes in place, on pressors for sepsis,
 post-op.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is 4.6 cm above the carina.  Three left-sided chest tubes
 are in place with removal of the smaller gauge left-sided chest tube.  The
 mediastinum is markedly widened compared to prior likely due to a combination
 of both vascular engorgement and some bleeding.  There is a moderate left
 effusion layering posteriorly and medially.  There is dense retrocardiac
 opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.
