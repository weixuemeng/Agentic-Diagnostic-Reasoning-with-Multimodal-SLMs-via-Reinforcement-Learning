                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Loculated pleural effusion status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are far lower compared to ___ causing vascular
 crowding and accentuate the size of the aortic arch; however, the mediastinal
 silhouette appears rather significantly increased compared to prior exam, but
 this still may be due to low lung volumes.  Otherwise, there is no significant
 change in moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with associated atelectatic
 change despite placement of a left base chest tube.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged moderate-to-large left pleural effusion despite chest
 tube placement.  Significant increase in size of the aortic shadow which may
 be due to low lung volumes, however, a repeat study with full inspiration is
 recommended to evaluate the aortic contour.
