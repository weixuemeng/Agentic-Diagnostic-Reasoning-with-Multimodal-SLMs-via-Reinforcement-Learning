                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of ___ ___ tube with its tip in the region of the distal antrum.
 
 There are somewhat lower lung volumes with some areas of increased
 opacification bilaterally, especially in the right upper zone.  Some of this
 could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though superimposed
 aspiration or pneumonia should be seriously considered.  Hazy opacification
 bilaterally could reflect some layering effusions.
