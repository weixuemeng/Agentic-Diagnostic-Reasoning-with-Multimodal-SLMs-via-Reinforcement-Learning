                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube is in the lower trachea, approximately 1.7 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the
 stomach.  The lung volumes are low.  There are bibasilar opacities that may
 represent atelectasis.  There is mild prominence of the interstitial markings,
 which may represent mild pulmonary congestion.  Cardiac silhouette appears
 slightly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube and NG tube in appropriate position.  Linear bibasilar opacities
 may represent atelectasis.
 2.  Developing pulmonary edema.
