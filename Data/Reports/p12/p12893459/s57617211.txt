                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The inspirational effort is improved to today's
 examination with lower positioned diaphragms as compared with the previous
 study.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no signs of pleural
 effusions are present in either lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  On the
 frontal view, local area of very crowded pulmonary vasculature is identified
 in the retrocardiac space and this corresponds to some small patchy
 infiltrates in the left lower lobe posterior segment where they are overlying
 the vertebral bodies of the lower spine.  On the preceding examination similar
 densities were suspected but poorly identified because of patient's poor
 inspirational effort.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Parenchymal infiltrates in left lower lobe posterior segment
 consistent with bronchopneumonic infiltrates.  
 
 Observed also that patient underwent a chest CT examination on the same day,
 practically identifying the same infiltrates as described.  Skeletal
 structures within the thoracic area are noted and include a mildly compressed
 vertebral body in the mid portion and a similar lesion in the lower portion of
 the thoracic spine.  Diffuse demineralization of skeletal structures are
 compatible with the patient's primary diagnosis of myeloma and are described
 in more detail on the chest CT.
