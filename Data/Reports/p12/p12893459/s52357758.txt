 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, likely reflecting a reduced inspiratory effort.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.  Tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Minimal atelectasis at both the left and the right lung
 bases, but no evidence of pneumonia.  The pre-existing opacities in the right
 upper lung have completely resolved.
