 COMPARISON:  ___; 12:32 a.m.

 component of the known left pneumothorax.  However, there is a millimetric
 paraaortic component.  No evidence of tension.  The left pigtail catheter is
 in constant position.  Slightly increasing right pleural effusion with right
 basal areas of atelectasis.  The atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions
 is decreasing.  No other relevant changes.
