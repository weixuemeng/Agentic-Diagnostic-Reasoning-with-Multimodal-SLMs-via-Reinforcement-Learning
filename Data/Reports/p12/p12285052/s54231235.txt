                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new left-sided IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed three hours prior to this study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new large left-sided pneumothorax with a deep sulcus
 sign with rightward displacement of the mediastinum raising concern for
 tension pneumothorax.  Otherwise, there is a new left-sided central line that
 is seen crossing the midline and ending likely at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  An esophageal tube is noted with the tip beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the
 carina, unchanged compared with prior exam.  
 
 Again seen is right lower lung opacities that now appear slightly more
 conspicuous than in prior likely secondary to underlying basal atelectases. 
 There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be secondary
 to atelectatic lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large left-sided pneumothorax with rightward displacement of the
 mediastinum raising concern for tension pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Supporting devices as described above.
 
 3.  More conspicuous opacities in the right lung base are compatible with
 worsening atelectasis in the setting of right lower lobe pneumonia/aspiration.
