                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax with chest tube in place and now on waterseal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left apical
 pneumothorax has apparently decreased further.  The other monitoring and
 support devices remain in place.  Bibasilar opacification persists, more
 prominent on the right.
