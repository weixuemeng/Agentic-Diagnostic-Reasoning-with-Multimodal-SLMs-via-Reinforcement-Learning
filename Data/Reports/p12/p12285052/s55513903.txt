                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.  Evaluate tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable supine radiographs were obtained before and after
 manipulation of an endotracheal tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  After manipulation of the tube, the tip of the tube is seen 3 cm
 above the carina in appropriate position in the radiograph labeled #2. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded, with an area of interstitial and
 alveolar opacities in the right lung base.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position after manipulation.
 
 2.  Right lung base opacity is compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia
 versus aspiration.
