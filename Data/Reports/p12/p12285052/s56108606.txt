                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dementia, lethargy  // presence of infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest provided.  AP upright and lateral views the
 chest provided demonstrate coarsened interstitial markings which could reflect
 chronic lung disease. No convincing signs of pneumonia. No large effusion or
 pneumothorax. Lateral view is suboptimal due to underpenetrated technique.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits. No acute bony
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Coarsened interstitial markings suggestive of chronic lung disease. Under
 penetrated lateral view limits assessment.
