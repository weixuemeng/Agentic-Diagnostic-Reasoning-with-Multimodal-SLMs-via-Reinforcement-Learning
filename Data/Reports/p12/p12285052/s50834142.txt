                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 4:08
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure and pneumothorax
 status post chest tube removal, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 8:30.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film, ___ at 4:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular central line
 are unchanged in position.  Persistent patchy opacities at both bases, which
 could reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Slightly
 prominent interstitium most likely reflects age-related or small airways
 related changes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
