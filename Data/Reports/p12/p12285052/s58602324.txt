                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hx dementia, minimally verbal, presenting with
 fever.  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the left.  The patient's hand overlies the lateral left
 mid to lower hemithorax, partially obscuring the view and limiting evaluation.
 Given this, no large focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal study due the patient's hand overlying the lateral left mid to
 lower hemi thorax.  Given this, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
