                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  Several skin folds are noted
 overlying the left chest without definite pneumothorax seen.  If pneumothorax
 is of clinical concern, suggest repeat.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  Upper paratracheal opacity is stable, most likely related to
 vascular structures with some contribution from the thyroid.
