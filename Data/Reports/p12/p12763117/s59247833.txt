 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue, weakness, questionable infiltrate on portable
 chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:40 and also with ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Questioned
 right basilar opacity is less apparent on this study as compared to the prior
 study.  However, there is subtle right basilar opacity on the frontal view,
 not substantiated on the lateral view, and which may be similar in comparison
 to ___, most likely representing atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questioned right basilar opacity on the prior study is not well
 seen on the current study and was likely artifactual.  Subtle right basilar
 opacity may be due to atelectasis.
