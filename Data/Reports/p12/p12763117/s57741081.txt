                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue and decreased appetite.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  Overall, the lungs are
 hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacity at the right lung base in the region of
 overlying skinfold may be due to overlying structures; however, early
 infectious process or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Consider repeat or dedicated PA and lateral views for further and
 better evaluation.
