                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, presenting after syncopal episode.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis. 
 There are patchy opacities projecting over the posterior left upper lobe and
 left suprahilar region.  The left hilum is slightly prominent.  The right lung
 is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity projecting over the left upper lobe and left suprahilar region
 raise concern for underlying infection although with slight prominence of the
 left hilum and history of COPD, recommend comparison to any prior radiographs
 and followup to resolution to exclude an underlying neoplastic process.
