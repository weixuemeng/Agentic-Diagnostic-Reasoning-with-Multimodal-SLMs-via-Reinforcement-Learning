                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a retrocardiac opacity which
 can be confirmed with a spinal sign in the lateral view and is obscuring the
 posterior margin of the left hemidiaphragm.  No other focal opacities are
 noted.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed in this AP view, but the
 heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation is most likely pneumonia.
