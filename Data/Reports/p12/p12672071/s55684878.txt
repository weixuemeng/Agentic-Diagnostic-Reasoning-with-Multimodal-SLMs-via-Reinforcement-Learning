                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post assault, kicked in the posterior
 ribs bilaterally, to assess for fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures are seen. 
 Please note that this study is limited for evaluation of subtle non-displaced
 rib fractures.  If there is high clinical concern, a dedicated rib series can
 be performed with a radiopaque marker placed at the site of maximum
 tenderness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
