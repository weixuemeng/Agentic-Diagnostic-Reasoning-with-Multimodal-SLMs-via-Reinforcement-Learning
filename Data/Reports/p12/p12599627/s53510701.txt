                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, vomiting, hematemesis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but similar. 
 The aorta remains unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Biapical scarring is symmetric.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in lung bases, possibly atelectasis. 
 Please note that aspiration or infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
