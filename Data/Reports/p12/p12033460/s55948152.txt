                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Density projecting along the anterior medial right first rib is probably bony
 in origin.  There is no evidence for congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Apparent increased
 density along the medial aspect of the right first rib, probably bony
 spurring; evaluation with a lordotic view is recommended to confirm and
 exclude a lung nodule.
