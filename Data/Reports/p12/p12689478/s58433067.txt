                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  Upon review of chest CT performed ___, the 1.5-cm
 nodular density evident projecting over the right lower lung on the radiograph
 is not evident.  It is unlikely that an intraparenchymal nodule, benign or
 malignant, would develop in this time period, suggesting nodule may be
 external to the patient or possibly related to a nipple.  Recommend
 reevaluation with chest radiograph with nipple markers and deep inspiration. 
 Chest CT is not warranted at this time.
