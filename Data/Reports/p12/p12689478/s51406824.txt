                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with question nodule on x-ray, possibly
 nipple.  Repeat with nipple markers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable in appearance.  Nipple
 markers are in place.  The opacity at the right lateral lung base seen on
 prior does not correlate with the nipple markers, which are seen more
 inferiorly.  This area at the right lateral lung base is less prominent on the
 current study.  There is a small residual opacity in this area and this may
 represent an area of atelectasis or clearing infiltrate if the patient has
 been treated in the interim.  There was no opacity in this area seen on recent
 chest CT, ___.  One more followup is recommended to document
 clearance.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or other area of focal
 consolidation within the lungs.  Stable appearance of the visualized bony
 thorax.
