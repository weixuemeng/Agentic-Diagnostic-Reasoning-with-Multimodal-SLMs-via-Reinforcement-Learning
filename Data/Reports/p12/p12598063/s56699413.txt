                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs without evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  Port-A-Cath extends to the lower portion of
 the SVC.
 
 There are multiple old rib fractures with adjacent pleural thickening.  The
 questioned nodule in the left mid lung laterally is still seen related to a
 posterior rib and could represent a bone island.
