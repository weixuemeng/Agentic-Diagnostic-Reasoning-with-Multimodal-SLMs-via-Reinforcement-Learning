                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are
 noted.  There is somewhat linear opacity at the lung bases, more conspicuous
 on the left than on the right.  In addition, there is a linear opacity
 projecting over the upper lobes posteriorly, potentially localizing to the
 right on the frontal view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal regions of consolidation particularly at the left lung
 base and projecting over one of the upper lobes posteriorly, likely on the
 right.  Extremely low lung volumes are seen and these could be due to
 atelectasis, although infection is certainly possible.
