  1. Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes and a dislocated right humeral
  head prosthesis projecting over the right upper lung.
  2. Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion
  and mild associated interstitial edema.
  3. Indistinct airspace opacities at the lung bases and right upper lung may be
  due to edema, atelectasis, or consolidation, depending upon the clinical
  scenario.
  4. Indeterminate lucent lesion projecting at the level of the posterior right
  fourth rib may represent a benign osseous lesion, in the absence of prior
  studies a pulmonary parenchymal process cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with wheezing, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right humeral head joint prosthesis appears dislocated from the glenoid
 fossa.  The prosthesis obscures a portion of the right upper lung.  Low lung
 volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  Allowing
 for this, there is moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion with likely
 mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace opacities an indistinct
 opacification of the right upper lung may represent atelectasis, edema, or
 focal consolidation.  A rounded lucent lesion with surrounding density
 projecting at the level of the right fourth rib is likely a benign lesion
 within the posterior rib with peripheral sclerosis.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization.  There is
 a small to moderate hiatal hernia
