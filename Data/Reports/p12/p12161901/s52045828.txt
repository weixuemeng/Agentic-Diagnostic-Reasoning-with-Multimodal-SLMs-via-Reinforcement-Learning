                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Intra-aortic balloon pump has been inserted with its tip projecting
 4 cm below the aortic roof. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Nodular
 opacities projecting over the left apex and she as well as over the right mid
 and lower lung and should be further assessed with non-emergent chest CT.
 There is no pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged in appearance
 
 ET tube tip is 6.3 cm above the carinal. Swan-Ganz catheter tip projecting
 over the level of the right ventricle outflow tract. Bilateral chest tubes are
 in place. Mediastinal drains are in place. NG tube tip is in the stomach.

  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Small nodular linear opacities projecting
  over the right peripheral lung and apex are noted, some of which may be
  pleural based. Nonemergent chest CT would better assess this finding. A linear
  calcification the following the left cardiac contour may represent pericardial
  calcification.
