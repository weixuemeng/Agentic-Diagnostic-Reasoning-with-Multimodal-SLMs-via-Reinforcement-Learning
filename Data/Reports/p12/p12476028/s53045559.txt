                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post enteric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates mediastinal fiducials with
 decreased size of right mediastinal prominence, as well as interval placement
 of an enteric tube which terminates in the distal esophagus.  This can be
 advanced approximately 12 cm to place the side hole beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube terminating in the distal esophagus.  This can be advanced
 approximately 12 cm to place the side hole beyond the gastroesophageal
 junction.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
