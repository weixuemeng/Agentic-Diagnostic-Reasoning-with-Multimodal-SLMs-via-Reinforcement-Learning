                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New O2 requirement, pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left
 pleural effusion has massively increased in extent.  The effusion occupies
 approximately half of the left hemithorax and causes substantial basal
 atelectasis.
 
 On the right, a small-to-moderate pleural effusion has newly occurred.  In the
 ventilated parts of the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of pneumonia. 
 No pneumothorax.
