                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, question worsening pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is a small-to-moderate left effusion, somewhat improved compared with
 ___.  There is also a small-to-moderate right effusion.  On the lateral
 view, there is a rounded convexity at the right base posteriorly associated
 with the effusion, which appears new compared with ___ and ___. 
 Given the time and course, the most likely etiology is loculated fluid and
 that would be in keeping with the appearance on the ___ abdominal CT.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged, thought there is a left ventricular configuration. 
 There is no CHF.  There is atelectasis and volume loss at the left base.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is obscured, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small-to-moderate left effusion, less pronounced than on ___, with
 underlying volume loss.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
 2) Small-to-moderate right effusion.  Convex appearance raises the question of
 loculated fluid.  Please see comment.
