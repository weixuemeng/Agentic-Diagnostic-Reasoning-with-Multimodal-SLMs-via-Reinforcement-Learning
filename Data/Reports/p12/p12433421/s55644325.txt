                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle correlating with effusion better appreciated on the lateral projection. 
 Additionally, there is an ovoid lucent area in the retrocardiac region on the
 frontal projection seen anteriorly on the lateral projection suggesting a
 hydropneumothorax of uncertain etiology.  The left lung appears clear without
 focal nodule, mass, or consolidation.  In the right lung base is a small
 nodule measuring 13 mm which may reflect a nipple shadow or alternatively a
 pulmonary parenchymal nodule or osseous lesion.  The remainder of the lungs
 appear clear.  No overt pulmonary edema or vascular congestion is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Concern for small left-sided hydropneumothorax of uncertain etiology.
 2.  13 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  Differential includes nipple
 shadow, osseous lesion, or pulmonary parenchymal nodule.  Followup radiographs
 with oblique projections and nipple markers could be considered. 
 Alternatively, CT of the chest could also be performed for further
 characterization of the left-sided pleural process and the right lower lobe
 nodule.
 3.  No confluent consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___ at 6:03 pm
 ___ ___ by telephone.
