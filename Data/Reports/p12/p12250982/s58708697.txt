 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the mid SVC. The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart size within normal limits.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Hyperinflation of the lungs with
 emphysema is re- demonstrated. Patchy opacities within the lower lobes
 bilaterally may reflect areas of atelectasis or infection. A trace right
 pleural effusion is also demonstrated. Left upper lobe rounded mass measuring
 up to 3.8 cm is not substantially changed in the interval. No pneumothorax is
 detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities may reflect atelectasis or infection. 
 Trace right pleural effusion.  Unchanged left upper lobe rounded mass
 concerning for malignancy. Other previously noted nodules within the lungs are
