                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Transfer from outside hospital with report of mediastinal air
 status post endoscopy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The prior study mentioned in the indication, was not
 available for comparison at the time of this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small amount of subcutaneous air overlying the neck. A lucency
 adjacent to the aorta may reflect pneumomediastinum.
 
 Large left lower lobe consolidation, and opacities in the right lower lobe are
 presumably from aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged. The hilar structures are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes
 involve the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Subcutaneous air in the neck and probable, trace pneumomediastinum.
 Comparison to prior imaging would be helpful.
 2. Left lower lobe consolidation and right lower lobe opacities are likely
 from aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 7:36 AM, 15 minutes after discovery of the findings.
