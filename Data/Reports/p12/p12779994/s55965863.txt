                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question acute abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained.  Underpenetrated
 technique limits evaluation of the lung bases.  There is an irregular opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung which could represent an abnormal appearance
 of atelectasis or scarring, though the possibility of a nodule/mass is not
 excluded.  There is suggestion of mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 effusions, though underpenetrated technique limits evaluation.  The heart
 appears within normal limits of size.  The mediastinum is grossly
 unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild edema.  Irregular opacity in the left mid lung.  A
 non-emergent CT chest may be obtained to further assess.
