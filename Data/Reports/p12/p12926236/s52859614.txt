 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky atelectasis is
 noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle could suggest the presence of a trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified however the medial aspects of the
 lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this
 region.  Clips are seen projecting over the right lateral chest wall. 
 Dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is present with associated
 degenerative changes.
