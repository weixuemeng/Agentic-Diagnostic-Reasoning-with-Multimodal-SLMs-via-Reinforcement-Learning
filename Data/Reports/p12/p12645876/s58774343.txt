                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with expiratory wheezing, rhonchi, evaluation for lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 The lungs are hyperinflated compatible with known COPD.  Bibasilar
 bronchiectasis and bronchial thickening is stable.  Right costodiaphragmatic
 sulcus is chronically thickened.  There is new mild focal opacity measuring 2
 cm at the right lung base, not visible on the lateral view, of unknown
 significance.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bi-apical
 scarring change with calcification is also unchanged.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are within normal limits with left pectoral atrioventricular
 pacemaker.  Healed right rib fracture is unchanged with thoracic spine
 compression fracture.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 New focal opacity at the right lung base that is not seen on the lateral view
 is of indeterminate significance.
 
 This has been discussed with Dr. ___.  The patient does not have any
 infectious symptoms.  It could only be atelectasis.  A chest x-ray followup in
 a month has been suggested.
