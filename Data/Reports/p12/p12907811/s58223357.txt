 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Malignant effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the left-sided chest tube, are in unchanged position.  On
 the left, adjacent to the lateral component of the pleural effusion, a
 millimetric hyperlucent line has newly appeared, likely reflecting a
 millimetric post-procedural pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of tension.
 
 Unchanged extent of the left pleural effusion.  Unchanged relatively massive
 basal and retrocardiac atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.  No other parenchymal changes, notably no newly appeared opacities. 
 The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
