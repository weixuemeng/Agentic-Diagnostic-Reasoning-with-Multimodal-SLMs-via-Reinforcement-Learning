                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chronic left lower lobe mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: Stable small right pleural effusion and moderate sized left pleural
 effusion. No interval change in the left lower lobe, retrocardiac,
 well-circumscribed, thick-walled, soft tissue lesion measuring 7.7 cm x 7.9 cm
 with central contents of air and fluid.  The inferosuperior aspect is distinct
 from the pleura and is in the lung; however, the inferoposterior aspect is
 partially obscured by the pleural effusion and may have pleural invasion. No
 vertebral destruction. No additional focal opacities. 
 
 No pneumothorax and the right lung is clear. Heart is top normal and
 mediastinal contours are normal without lymphadenopathy. Severe emphysema with
 widened AP diameter, hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragms is
 unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe mass is unchanged.
 2.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
