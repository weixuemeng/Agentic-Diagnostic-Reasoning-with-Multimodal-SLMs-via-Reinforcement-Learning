 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusion.  Monitoring.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions as well as left lower lobe mass and chronic left lower lobe
 collapse are all unchanged since the prior radiograph.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear with no new focal opacity.  The heart is unchanged and top
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal without lymphadenopathy. 
 Emphysematous changes characterized by increased AP diameter and flat
 diaphragms as well as hyperinflated lungs are also unchanged.  Calcified aorta
 is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of left lower lobe mass and partial collapse.
