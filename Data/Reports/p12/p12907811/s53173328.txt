                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe mass status post mediastinoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little change compared to a prior examination with
 re-demonstration of mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increased
 prominence of the left heart border is likely due to ___ effect rather than
 pneumomediastinum and central mediastinum and superior mediastinum are
 unremarkable without evidence of free air or subcutaneous gas.  The large
 cavitating left lower lobe mass previously described on CT is difficult to
 evaluate on this portable examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post mediastinoscopy without evidence of complication.
