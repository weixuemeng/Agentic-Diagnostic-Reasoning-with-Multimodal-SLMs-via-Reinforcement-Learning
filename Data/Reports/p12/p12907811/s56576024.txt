                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung with a large malignant
 pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Read 8 chest radiograph ___, whole-body PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A massive left-sided pleural effusion appears minimally decreased in volume
 compared to ___ with persistent compression and collapse of most of the
 left lung.  Now seen is a roughly 5.6 cm cavitating lesion in the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe with air-fluid levels corresponding to
 patient's known squamous cell carcinoma which demonstrated cavitation on
 PET-CT from ___.  The right lung is essentially clear.  There is
 also a small right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Massive left-sided pleural effusion minimally decreased in volume as compared
 to prior examination with probable slight re-expansion of the left lower lung
 with redemonstration of a roughly 5.6 cm cavitating lesion in the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe corresponding to patient's known SCC.
