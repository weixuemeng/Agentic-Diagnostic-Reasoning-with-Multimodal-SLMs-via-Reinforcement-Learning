                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with small cell cancer of left lower
 lobe and COPD, malignant pleural effusion, ischemic cardiomyopathy, presents
 now with increased oxygen requirement.  Evaluation of pleural effusion and
 chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  During the interval, a left-sided chest tube has been
 placed through the lower chest wall and is seen to terminate just to the
 midline in supradiaphragmatic position.  Previously identified massive pleural
 effusion has not changed significantly.  There remains moderate shift of
 mediastinal structures towards the left side, indicative of volume loss.  The
 right hemithorax does not show any significant pulmonary abnormality, nor is
 there evidence of a pneumothorax on the right side.
