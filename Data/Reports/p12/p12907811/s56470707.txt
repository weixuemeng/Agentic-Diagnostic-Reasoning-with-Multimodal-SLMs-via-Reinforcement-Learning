 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent abrupt
 angulation of the tube course at the level of the side port.  Large partially
 loculated left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed, nor are adjacent
 multifocal lung parenchymal opacities in the left lung.  In the right lung,
 mild interstitial edema is present as well as a mild-to-moderate layering
 right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
