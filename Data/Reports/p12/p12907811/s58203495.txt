                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with abrupt angulation
 at the side port.  No substantial change in large partially loculated left
 pleural effusion and no visible pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph. 
 With the exception of chest tube placement, there is otherwise no relevant
 short interval change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of
 several hours earlier.
