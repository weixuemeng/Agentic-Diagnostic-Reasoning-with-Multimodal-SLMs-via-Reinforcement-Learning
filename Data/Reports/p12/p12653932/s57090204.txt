                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman, 12 days postpartum, with fever, abdominal pain
 and vaginal bleeding. Patient is on therapeutic lovenox for history of MRSA
 endocarditis with septic emboli.  // Please evaluate for cause of fever
 (pneumonia) vs PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear without consolidations or effusions. Heart
 size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Pleural
 surfaces are normal.  Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or PE, although evaluation for PE is
 suboptimal on chest radiograph and CTPE should be considered in the proper
 clinical setting.
