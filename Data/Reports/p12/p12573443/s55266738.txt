 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 926
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post NG tube placement, check
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 926 is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm
 and the tip is projecting over the stomach.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours remain stable.  The previously described multiple bilateral pulmonary
 nodules are well visualized on the current study, likely due to differences in
 positioning, but further imaging evaluation with CT remains recommended. 
 Results of this examination were entered into the critical results dashboard
 on ___ at 9:56 a.m.  Lung volumes are slightly diminished with patchy
 opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large effusions.
