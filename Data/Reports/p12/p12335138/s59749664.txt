                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/weakness  // ___M w/weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The aorta is
 minimally calcified.  Subtle bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis however
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The stomach is moderately
 distended with gas and fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities, which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful,
 particularly if there is clinical suspicion for infection.
