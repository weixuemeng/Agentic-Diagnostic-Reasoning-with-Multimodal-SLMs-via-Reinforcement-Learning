                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ F w/ severe celiac disease, obesity, lupus anticoagulant (not
 on AC, no h/o VTE), presenting with several weeks of chest pain and lower
 extremity swelling.  // eval for VQ scan
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is overall stable in appearance with slight
 increase in the right mediastinal width, potentially representing
 lymphadenopathy versus vascular structure.
 
 Left basal atelectasis is demonstrated, new.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Further assessment to exclude the possibility of metastatic in a
 lymphadenopathy is recommended with chest CT.  If IV contrast cannot be
 administered, assessment with V/Q scan to exclude the possibility of pulmonary
 embolism would be beneficial.
