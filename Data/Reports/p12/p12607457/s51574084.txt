                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Low lung volumes are present.  Bronchovascular
 structures are crowded as result of low lung volumes, but there is no
 pulmonary edema.  Chronic interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally, most
 pronounced at the periphery.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Re- demonstrated is a comminuted fracture of the
 right proximal humerus.  Multiple surgical anchors are seen over the
 projecting over the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with findings compatible with chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  No focal consolidation to suggest superimposed pneumonia.
