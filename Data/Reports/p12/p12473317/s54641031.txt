 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  An electronic device again projects over the left anterior
 hemithorax within subcutaneous soft tissues.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  Mitral annular calcifications are again
 present.  Streaky opacities have decreased and suggest minor atelectasis or
 scarring at the left lung base.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are
 no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are similar along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
