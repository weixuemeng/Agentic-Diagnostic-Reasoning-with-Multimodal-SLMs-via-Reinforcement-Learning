                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers and cough with upper GI bleed, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Despite technique, the heart size is
 enlarged, but unchanged from prior.  There is no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  A slight
 increase in interstitial markings compared to prior is noted.  Calcifications
 are seen within the aortic arch.  The mediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable cardiomegaly with a
 slight increase in interstial markings.  Pulmonary edema cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
