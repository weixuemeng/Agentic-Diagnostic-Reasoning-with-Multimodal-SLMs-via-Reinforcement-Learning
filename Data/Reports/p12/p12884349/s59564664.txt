                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with bleeding ulcers status post EGD,
 persistent cough and fever to 102.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is enlarged.  There is developing consolidation within
 the left upper lobe, which is better seen on the lateral view.  It is
 marginating the major fissure.  This likely represents a developing pneumonia
 given the clinical history.  The right lung field is grossly clear.  There are
 no pneumothoraces.
