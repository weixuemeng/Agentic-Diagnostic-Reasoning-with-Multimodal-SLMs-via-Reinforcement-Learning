                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Headache, neck stiffness and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The frontal
 view is somewhat underpenetrated, likely due to body habitus.  However, given
 this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Projecting over the right lateral neck, there is a
 thin linear radiopaque density measuring 4.5 cm in length, which is likely
 external to the patient.  If this is a catheter/line, it does not extend into
 the hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
