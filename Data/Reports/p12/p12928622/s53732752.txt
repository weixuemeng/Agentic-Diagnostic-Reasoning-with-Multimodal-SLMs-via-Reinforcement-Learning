                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild interstitial edema.  Left basilar segmental atelectasis is
 worse than on most recent radiograph.  The heart size appears relatively
 stable given differences in technique from prior radiographs.  Tortuosity of
 the aortic arch is somewhat exaggerated due to leftward rotation.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Compression fracture in the upper
 thoracic vertebra is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.
