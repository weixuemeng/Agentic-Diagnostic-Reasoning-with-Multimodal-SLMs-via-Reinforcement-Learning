                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Previously seen
 right upper lobe partial atelectasis has essentially resolved and there has
 been re-expansion of the right upper lobe.  Mild left basilar atelectasis is
 seen.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours demonstrate a
 mildly tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.  Interval re-expansion of the
 right upper lobe.
