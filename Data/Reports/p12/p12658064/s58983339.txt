 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with failure to thrive and progressive productive
 cough.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is increased right
 perihilar opacity, compatible with known right hilar small cell lung cancer. 
 Linear opacity in the right mid lung is likely secondary to post-obstructive
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known right perihilar mass with some right upper lobe
 atelectasis.  No definite acute superimposed cardiopulmonary process.
