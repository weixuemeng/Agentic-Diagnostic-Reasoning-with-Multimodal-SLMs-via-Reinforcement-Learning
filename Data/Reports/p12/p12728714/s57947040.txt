                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain after fall.  Assess for injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Right lung base
 opacities, most likely represent atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable. Mild deformities of the posterior right ribs, likely relate to
 remote injuries.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  In the setting on high clinical
 suspicion for rib fracture, consider dedicated rib series.
