                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and possible leukemia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the left mid lung zone, there is a 13 mm round opacity. In the right
 midlung zone, there is a similar 8 mm round opacity. These likely represent
 nipple shadows. The lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation or edema.
 There is a tiny left pleural effusion. No right pleural effusion is
 identified. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  There are mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine, similar to the prior exam from ___. Old left rib fractures are noted.
 Surgical clips are noted in the mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Tiny left pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Bilateral rounded opacities are likely nipple shadows.  A repeat
 radiograph with nipple markers is recommended to exclude pulmonary nodules.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 10:15 AM, 60 minutes after discovery of the
