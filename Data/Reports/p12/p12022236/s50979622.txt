                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spotaneous PTX s/p CT to water seal  // post
 water-seal film
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, left pigtail pleural catheter has
 slightly changed in position, and a tiny left apical pneumothorax is
 visualized with apparent resolution of the basilar component of the
 pneumothorax.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for coarse reticular interstitial
 opacities at both lung bases with appearance favoring chronic interstitial
 lung disease although coexisting acute interstitial abnormality is also
 possible.
