                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spontaneous PTX, now s/p chest tube clamp 1
 hr trial  // chest tube clamp 1 hr trial, post-clamp film
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of several hr earlier, left pleural
 catheter remains in place, with a tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Slight
 worsening of left basilar opacity, likely due to atelectasis superimposed upon
 chronic fibrosis although aspiration is an additional consideration for the
 acute component.
