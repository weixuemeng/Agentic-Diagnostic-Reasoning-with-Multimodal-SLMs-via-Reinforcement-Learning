                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lower quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ and CT from ___. 
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Bibasilar densities are present, corresponding to rounded
 atelectasis within the right lower lobe and linear atelectasis within the left
 lower lobe, as seen on the CT examination performed on the same day. There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar densities reflect
 atelectasis, better visualized on the CT examination performed today.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacites, seen as rounded atelectasis at the right base
 and linear atelectasis at the left base on the CT performed earlier this
 evening.
