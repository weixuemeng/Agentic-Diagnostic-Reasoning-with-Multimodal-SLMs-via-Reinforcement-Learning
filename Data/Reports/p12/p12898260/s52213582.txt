                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and a CT from that same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild upper zone redistribution indistinctness of pulmonary
 vascularity suggesting slight fluid overload as well as a more confluent
 developing right basilar opacity.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Thick anterior osteophytes are noted along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of slight fluid overload with developing
 right basilar opacity; pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate
 setting versus atelectasis, aspiration or confluent edema.
