                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is opacification at the right base, which is mostly accounted
 for by the diaphragm, but superior to the diaphragm, there is a small
 parenchymal opacity which is concerning for a possible pneumonia.  Stable hazy
 opacification at the left base is consistent with calcified pleural plaques. 
 There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, but no overt pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 is moderately enlarged and stable.  There is atherosclerosis of the aorta.  A
 right-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is present and in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Opacification at the right base is mostly due to the diaphragm, but a
 small parenchymal opacity is present and concerning for pneumonia.  
 2.  Pulmonary vascular prominence without overt pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
