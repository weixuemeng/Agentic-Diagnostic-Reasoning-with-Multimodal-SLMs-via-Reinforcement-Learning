                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increased shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is
 increased prominence and cephalization of the pulmonary vascular markings
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  The heart is enlarged but stable compared to
 prior study.  Prominence of the left hilum likely represents enlarged
 pulmonary artery and thus pulmonary hypertension. There is calcification of
 the aortic knob. There is stable blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely due to chronic pleural thickening.  There are also pleural plaques seen
 indicative of asbestos-related pleural disease.  Incidental note is made of an
 azygos fissure.  A two-lead right-sided pacemaker in stable position without
 complication.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Pulmonary edema with stable cardiomegaly. 
 2. Prominent pulmonary artery likely related to pulmonary hypertension 
 3. Stable asbestos-related pleural disease and blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely due to pleural thickening.
