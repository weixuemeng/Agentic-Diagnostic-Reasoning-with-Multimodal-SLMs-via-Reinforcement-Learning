                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain and hypoxia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear except for left
 upper lobe questionable opacity, potentially might represent summation of
 shadows.  The rest of the lungs are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Questionable opacity in the left apex.  Correlation with lordotic view is
 recommended for precise characterization.
