                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, with widening of the
 mediastinum attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis and presence of an
 aberrant right subclavian artery.  Pulmonary vascularity is slightly
 prominent, unchanged, and the hilar contours are unremarkable.  Paraseptal
 emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated within the lung apices.  Previously
 noted right lower lobe nodular opacities as noted on the chest CT are not
 clearly seen on the current exam.  No new areas of focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and no significant interval change
 compared to the prior chest radiograph.
