                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure and lung masses, now with
 hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT of the chest without
 contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's known right apical lucent lesion is redemonstrated,
 compatible with mycetoma seen on recent CT.  Prominent coarse interstitial
 lung markings bilaterally are unchanged with persistent densities most
 pronounced in the bilateral lung bases, reflecting fibrotic changes at the
 lung seen on recent CT.  No superimposed focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, but stable.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits with calcification at the aortic knob again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Similar appearance of the patient's known right apical mycetoma.
 
 2.  Unchanged fibrotic appearance of the lungs.
