                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p liver transplant with swan  // Eval for swan
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 03:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, the
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned, with the tip now projecting over the
 expected location of the main pulmonary trunk.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 4.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube extends at least the body of the
 stomach.  There is a catheter projecting over the right upper abdomen.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely stable, accounting for slightly
 lower lung volumes.  Haziness at the right lung base suggests a layering
 pleural effusion.  No sizable pleural effusion on the left.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter, which now terminates at
 the main pulmonary trunk.  No change in other support lines/devices.
 2. Probable right pleural effusion, new.
 3. Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
