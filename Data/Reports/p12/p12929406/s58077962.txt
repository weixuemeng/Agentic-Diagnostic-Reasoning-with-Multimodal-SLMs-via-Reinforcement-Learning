                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with malpositioned right PICC line on the
 first attempt, here to reassess placement after repositioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed two hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the preceding radiograph, there is interval
 repositioning of the right-sided PICC line.  The course of the line is
 unremarkable with the tip of the line now projecting over the mid SVC.  There
 is no evidence of complication, specifically no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the
 appearance of the heart and lungs is unchanged from the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line with tip terminating in the mid SVC.
