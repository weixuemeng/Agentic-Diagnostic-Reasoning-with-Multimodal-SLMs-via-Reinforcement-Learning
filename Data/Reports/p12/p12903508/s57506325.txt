                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, status post aortic valve replacement and
 previous bilateral pneumothoraces.
 
 STUDY:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  A right-sided central venous catheter tip seats in the
 lower SVC.  Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Prosthetic aortic and
 mitral valves are present.  A left-sided drain is in place, and the right
 chest drain has been retracted a small amount.  Small bilateral apical
 pneumothoraces persist, similar in size to prior study. There is no
 mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic flattening to suggest tension.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions also persist.
