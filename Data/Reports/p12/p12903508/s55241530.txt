                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with tracheostomy and recently placed PICC.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided PICC catheter is seen in unchanged position terminating
 within the right atrium.  Tracheostomy tube is seen in unchanged position with
 no obvious signs of cuff hyperinflation.  There has been increase in right
 pleural effusion with likely superimposed right-sided edema.  There has been
 decrease in the observed left-sided effusion.  Apparent shift in pleural
 effusion is most likely related to patient positioning.  There is stable
 cardiomegaly.  Sternotomy wires are seen in unchanged position, aligned along
 the midline with no evidence of failure.  Aortic valve prosthesis is seen
 unchanged in position within the heart.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Right-sided PICC catheter still terminates within the right atrium. 
 2) Heart is stably enlarged with interval increase in right-sided pleural
 effusion and decrease in left-sided effusion.
