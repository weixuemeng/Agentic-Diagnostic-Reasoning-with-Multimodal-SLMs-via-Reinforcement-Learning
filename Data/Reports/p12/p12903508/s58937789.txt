                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:27.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the bilateral
 pleural effusions is unchanged.  The effusions are still more extensive on the
 right than on the left and create relatively substantial areas of atelectasis.
 A pre-existing miniscule pneumothorax on the left is no longer visible.  Mild
 fluid overload.  No evidence of interval appearance of new parenchymal
 opacities.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
