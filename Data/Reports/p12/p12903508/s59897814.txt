                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral pneumothoraces.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:20 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  Right-sided central venous catheter tip is seen in the
 lower SVC.  Sternotomy wires and prosthetic valves are unchanged.  Bilateral
 chest tubes are unchanged.  Small bi-apical pneumothoraces persist, although
 there is no diaphragmatic flattening or mediastinal shift to suggest tension. 
 There persists bibasilar opacity, more prominent on the right than the left,
 and in the appropriate clinical setting may represent pneumonia.  There is no
 large pleural effusion.
