                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation after CABG and aortic valve replacements.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed .
 
 The patient was extubated in the  interval.  There is Swan-Ganz catheter,
 bilateral chest tubes, mediastinal drain, and replaced valves, unchanged in
 appearance and position.  Interval progression of bibasilar, especially right
 lower lobe opacities /atelectasis seen, can also be a combination of pleural
 effusion and infectious process, attention to this area is highly recommended 
 Overall, there is slight improvement in pulmonary edema, currently minimal,
 interstitial.
