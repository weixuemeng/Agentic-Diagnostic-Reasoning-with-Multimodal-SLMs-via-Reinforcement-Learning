                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male transferred from outside hospital,
 status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: There is an endotracheal tube seen with tip terminating at midpoint
 between the inferior aspect of the clavicle and the carina in adequate
 position.  There is also an orogastric tube seen with tip coursing below the
 field of view of the image obtained.  Mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits with the exception of pulmonary arterial enlargement.  There is suture
 material projecting over the right lung.  The bilateral pleural effusions and
 osseous sclerotic lesions are better assessed on the CT Torso examination.  
 Overlying bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and no acute fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in adequate position.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and osseous sclerotic lesions better assessed
 on subsequent CT Torso examination.
