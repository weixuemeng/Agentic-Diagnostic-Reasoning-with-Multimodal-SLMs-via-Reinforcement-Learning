 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:18 PM
  In comparison to the prior exam performed at 11:55 on the same day, there has
  been no significant interval change in the opacity of the right lung base,
  which likely represents a combination of a small pleural effusion and adjacent
  atelectasis.  No new consolidations concerning for pneumonia are identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Difficult intubation post bronchoscopy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged and slightly deviated towards the
 right side though the patient is rotated and this limits the evaluation of the
 cardiomediastinum.  Small left effusion is unchanged.  Left lower lobe
 opacities are stable.  Left basal pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. 
 ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is in the proximal duodenum. 
 Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Cervical hardware is partially imaged. 
 Right lower lobe opacity is unchanged, may represent a combination of effusion
 and atelectasis.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
