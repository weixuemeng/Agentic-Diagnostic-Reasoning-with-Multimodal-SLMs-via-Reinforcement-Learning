  There has been interval insertion of a tracheostomy tube, which is difficult
  to evaluate given the overlying cervical hardware, however the tip appears to
  be within the trachea at the level of the posterior 3rd rib.  Slight interval
  improvement of the opacity in the right lower lobe.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after tracheostomy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place with its tip partially obscured by the spinal
 hardware thus cannot be precisely determined.  The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the
 stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Bibasal atelectasis and left
 pigtail catheter are unchanged in appearance.  The right lower lung
 atelectasis is noted, improved as compared to prior examination.
