 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube projects over the gastroesophageal junction, the tube should be advanced
 by approximately 5 cm.  The previously overinflated stomach has deflated.  The
 left pigtail catheter in the pleural space is in unchanged position.  The
 basal pleural air collection is constant in appearance.  There is no apical
 left pneumothorax.  The right lung base shows increasing atelectasis due to
 decreasing right lung volumes.  The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is
 constant.
