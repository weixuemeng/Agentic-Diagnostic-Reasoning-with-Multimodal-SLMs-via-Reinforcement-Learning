                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:57 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia, bradycardia, rule out aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 10:17 p.m.:
 
 Right middle and lower lobe collapse, and accompanying moderate right pleural
 effusion have been present without appreciable improvement for the past
 several days.  Previous cardiac decompensation reflected in pulmonary edema
 and vascular congestion has resolved.  Left lower lobe has been collapsed as
 well, though there may be slight improvement in the degree of atelectasis. 
 Alternatively, the left lower lobe is still collapsed and there is new
 consolidation at its upper margin in the lingula or apicoposterior segment of
 the left upper lobe.  Bronchopulmonary toilet is probably the underlying
 problem.  I cannot say whether aspiration is contributory.
