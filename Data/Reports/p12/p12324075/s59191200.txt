                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup atelectasis, patient with mucous plugging.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There has been interval resolution of collapse of the right lower lobe.
 Remaining opacities in the right lower lobe and right middle lobes represent
 atelectasis and/or reexpansion edema.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has
 improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no other interval changes.
