                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent intubation for respiratory failure. 
 Evaluate for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates oblique
 positioning of the patient.  There is a large left-sided basal pneumothorax
 with associated rightward shift of the mediastinum, raising concern for
 tension pneumothorax.  There may be a small right-sided pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Assessment of endotracheal tube positioning is made
 difficult based on the patient's position; however, the endotracheal tube ends
 at the level of the clavicular heads. Note is made of gaseous distension of
 the stomach. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large left-sided basilar pneumothorax with possible rightward shift of the
 mediastinum raising concern for tension pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Gaseous distension of the stomach; consider placement of a NG tube for
 decompression.
 
 COMMENTS:  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ team) by Dr.
 ___ ___ telephone at 1:26 p.m. on ___, five minutes after these
