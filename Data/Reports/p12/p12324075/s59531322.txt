                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tracheostomy with desaturations to the mid 80s.  Evaluate for
 lobar collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.  A left-sided
 pacemaker with associated right atrial and right ventricular leads is
 unchanged.  Cervical spine fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.  There is
 a right PICC ending in the mid SVC, unchanged.  Right lower lung atelectasis
 is slightly increased.  Left lower lung atelectasis has substantially
 improved. The lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal. The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are no definite pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right lower opacities, could be due to increasing atelectasis or
 reexpansion pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Decreased left lower lung atelectasis.
