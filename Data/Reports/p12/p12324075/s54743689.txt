 REASON FOR EXAM:  Unstable C7 fracture.  Intubated patient.  CSF leak.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study, ___.
 
 There has been interval increase in opacity in the right lower hemithorax due
 to increased consolidation in the lateral aspect of the right middle lobe. 
 The amount of pleural effusion is small.  There is lesser volume in the right
 lower lobe.  Small left effusion is stable.  Left lower lobe opacities are
 unchanged.  Right subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.  Cervical hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in consolidation and lesser volume in the right middle
 lobe and right lower lobes.
