                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Desaturation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier.
 
 Right lower lobe collapse has resolved.  Right middle lobe atelectasis has
 improved.  Bilateral pleural effusions are less conspicuous than before due to
 the difference in positioning of the patient.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Remaining opacities in the right lower hemithorax are likely
 reexpansion pulmonary edema.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Pacer leads
 are in standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
