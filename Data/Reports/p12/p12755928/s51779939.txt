                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two days of shortness of breath.  Recent CyberKnife treatment for
 left upper lobe nodule.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There is mild levoscoliosis throughout the thoracic spine.  A
 fiducial seed is again seen within the left upper lobe.  Since ___,
 there is a new faint linear opacity just superior and lateral to the fiducial
 seed, which may represent post-radiation fibrosis.  No definite consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New faint linear opacity at the lateral aspect of the left upper
 lobe, adjacent to the fiducial seed, likely representing post-CyberKnife
 fibrosis.  No consolidations or effusions detected.
 
 The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at the time of
