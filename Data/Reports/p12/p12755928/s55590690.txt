                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post left lung fiducial seed placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax, new effusion, fiducial position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph taken on the same day, ___ at
 12:34 p.m.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  This is possibly a duplicate study given
 the two-hour time interval from the prior radiograph.  There is no change in
 the fiducial lung marker position or the remainder of the examination in the
 intervening two hours.
