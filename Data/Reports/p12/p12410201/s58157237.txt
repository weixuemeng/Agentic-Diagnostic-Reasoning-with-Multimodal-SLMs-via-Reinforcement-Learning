                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left base
 atelectasis is changed.  Opacities in the right middle lobe are also stable
 since the prior study, probably compatible with scarring and atelectasis. 
 There are no new opacities which are concerning for pneumonia.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  No convincing evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
