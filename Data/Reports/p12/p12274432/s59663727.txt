                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female with respiratory distress recently reintubated
 // EET position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded
 lungs. There is an persistent increased opacification of the bilateral bases,
 which likely represents atelectasis or aspiration. Superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 The endotracheal tube ends 3.9 cm from the carina. The nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach, with the last side port at the GE junction.Note is
 made of multiple calcified left axillary lymph nodes and degenerative changes
 at the glenohumeral joints, possibly AVN right humeral head.  Calcified plaque
 is seen at the left carotid bifurcation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube ends 3.9 cm from the carina.
 
 2. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, with the last side port at the
 GE junction, and should be advanced prior to use.
