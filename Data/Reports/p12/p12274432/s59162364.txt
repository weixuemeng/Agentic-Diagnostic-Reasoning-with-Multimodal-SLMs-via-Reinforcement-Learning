                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cerebellar hemorrhage // resp failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded
 lungs. There is new opacification of the right base which likely represents
 atelectasis or aspiration. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The
 left lung demonstrates increased retrocardiac opacity, also likely consistent
 with aspiration or atelectasis. The endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm from the
 carina . The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and at the field of
 view. There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the bilateral bases likely represents atelectasis
 or aspiration. Small right-sided pleural effusion.
