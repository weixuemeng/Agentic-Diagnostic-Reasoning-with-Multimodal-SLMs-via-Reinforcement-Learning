                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation, here for assessment of
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending to
 2.2 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube has tip in the stomach and side port
 below the GE junction.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly prominent
 but accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  The lungs are clear
 without pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Several cholecystectomy clips are
 seen.  There is retained contrast material in the proximal renal collecting
 systems.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 2.2 cm above the carina.  Consider retraction by 1 to 2 cm.
 2.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
 3.  Retained contrast material in the renal collecting systems, to be expected
 following recent preceding contrast-enhanced CT exam.
 
 Findings text paged to Dr. ___ at 9:25 a.m. on ___
 following failed attempt for direct phone contact.
