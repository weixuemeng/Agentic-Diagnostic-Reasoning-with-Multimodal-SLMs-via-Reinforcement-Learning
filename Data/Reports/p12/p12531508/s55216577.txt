                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diffusely tender, tympanic abdomen, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Again,
 there is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.  A left-sided pacemaker
 is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Azygos lobe is incidentally noted.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild central pulmonary vascular congestion,
 stable.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
