                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, question acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, there is a new partially well defined
 (lateral margin in not clearly seen) rounded density projecting over the right
 mid lung. Whether this is a mass, infection or infarction depends upon
 chronicity, unfortunately unknown.  Additionally, there is greater
 heterogenous opacification of the right lower lobe, that could be pneumonia or
 a condition such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma since there was similar but
 less extensive opacification in this region in ___.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is a little worse.  A left chest wall
 pacemaker sends transvenous leads to the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suggest CT for new right lung lesion, discussed above.
 2.  Worsened or recurrent consolidation right lower lobe, deserves CT
 evaluation also.
 3.  Small right pleural effusion.
 4.  Increased moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 These findings were discussed Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 5:15 a.m.
