                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left effusion with thoracentesis, to assess for reaccumulation of
 fluid and reexpansion of the lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is more hazy
 opacification at the left base, consistent with increased pleural fluid.  Some
 of this could be related to a more supine position of the patient.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  The right lung is clear.
