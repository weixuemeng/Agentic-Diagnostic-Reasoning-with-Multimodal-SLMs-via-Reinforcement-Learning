 RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  History of cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is slight new
 blunting of the left lateral costophrenic sulcus, probably a trace pleural
 effusion, or perhaps atelectasis effacing the sulcus.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion on the right.  The lungs appear clear.  A biliary stent is
 partly imaged in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
