  scarring, which warrants additional characterization with non
  urgent/outpatient chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AAA, pre-op CXR  // pneumonia? heart size?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms consistent with
 underlying COPD.  There is extensive biapical scarring, which appears slightly
 nodular.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  There is calcification of the aortic knob.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.  There is generalized loss of height in the lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No cardiomegaly or pneumonia.
 2. Evidence of COPD and nodular by apical scarring, which warrants comparison
 to prior imaging or additional characterization with non urgent/outpatient
 chest CT.  Differential includes reactivation tuberculosis, mycetoma, or
 malignancy.
