                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain with a history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CTA from ___.  Chest CTA from ___ (subsequent to this chest
 radiograph).
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 right Port-A-Cath ends near the superior cavoatrial junction.  Near-complete
 collapse of the right middle lobe is not significantly changed.  A known
 infiltrative mass involving the right middle lobe is inseparable from the
 atelectasis in this region by radiography.  Ground-glass opacities throughout
 both lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes, is better evaluated on
 subsequent chest CTA.  Right perihilar opacity is stable versus slightly
 increased compared to prior.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  A moderate right subpulmonic effusion is noted.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged near-complete collapse of the right middle lobe.
 
 2.  Subtle ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs, fully described on
 the subsequent chest CTA from ___.
 
 3.  Stable to mildly increased right perihilar opacity.
 
 3.  Moderate right subpulmonic pleural effusion.
