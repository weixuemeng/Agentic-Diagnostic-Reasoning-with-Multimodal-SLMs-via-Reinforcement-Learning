                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic lung carcinoma, now
 presenting with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___, chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CTA of the chest from ___ at 16:30.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right approach Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is a triangular opacity within
 the right middle lobe which corresponds to progressive right middle lobe
 collapse, better characterized on concurrent CT of the chest.  A known
 infiltrative right middle lobe mass is obscured by the progressive lobar
 atelectasis.  Paramediastinal density in the region of the right hilum is
 partly related to post-radiation change, though is increased secondary to
 probable superimposed consolidation.  The left lung appears clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There is a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Progressive right middle lobe collapse in a patient with a known
 infiltrative right middle lobe lung carcinoma
 2.  Increasing right hilar opacity secondary to probable superimposed
 infection, better characterized on concurrent CT.
 3.  Small right pleural effusion
