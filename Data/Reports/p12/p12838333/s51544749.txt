                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Chronic cardiomegaly is
 mild to moderate, with a left ventricular configuration.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Retrocardiac opacity correlates on the
 lateral view to density overlying the lower thoracic spine, compatible with
 left lower lobe consolidation.  Linear opacities in the right mid lung are
 similar to prior, compatible with scarring.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
