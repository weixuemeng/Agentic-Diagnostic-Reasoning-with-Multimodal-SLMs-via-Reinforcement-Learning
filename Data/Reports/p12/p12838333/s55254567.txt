                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bradycardia and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal with a left
 ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with
 mild atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Streaky linear opacities in
 the lung bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky linear opacities in lung bases most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
