 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:24 PM
  A right pleural pigtail catheter is again noted with continued improvement in
  the pleural effusion at the right lung base.  There is now placement of a
  second right pleural pigtail catheter more superiorly.  There is unchanged
  appearance of a moderate loculated effusion at the apex and small on
  laterally.  There is multi focal atelectasis on the right.  Apparent
  improvement in the left pleural effusion may be positional versus true
  resolution.  No pneumothorax.  Right PICC in unchanged position.
