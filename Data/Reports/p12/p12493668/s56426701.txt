                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with empyema  // ? PICC placement after pull
 back
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 16:11.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical pleural loculation appears smaller, but the I think this is an
 artifact of change in patient position rather than real drainage.  Pleural
 drainage catheters are unchanged in their respective positions and a smaller
 basal component of right pleural effusion persists, probably responsible for
 persistent basal atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Right PIC line ends no less
 than below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 Left lung clear.  Heart size normal.
