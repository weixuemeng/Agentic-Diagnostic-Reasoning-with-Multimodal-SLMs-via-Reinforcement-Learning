 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CP, SOB, history of cirrhosis // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Opacity in the right mid
 to lower lung is noted which is new from the prior exam and could reflect
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  A small adjacent effusion is difficult to
 exclude.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Heart size difficult to assess. 
 Mediastinal contour is grossly within normal limits.  No pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of opacity within the right mid to lower lung, which
 could represent atelectasis and pneumonia with small effusion.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
