                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with empyema  // sp decortication
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, 2 chest tubes remain in place in
 the right hemi thorax with no definite pneumothorax.  Small to moderate right
 pleural effusion is again demonstrated.  Increasing opacities at the right
 lung base medially and in the left retrocardiac region could potentially be
 due to atelectasis but aspiration and infectious pneumonia should also be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema.
