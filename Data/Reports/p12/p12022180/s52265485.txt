                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left hilum is slightly larger than expected and may be due to
 lymph nodes. No other signs of lymphadenopathy are noted. The lungs are clear
 with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. The left hilum is slightly
 larger than expected and may be due to lymph nodes. A 6 week followup chest
 radiograph is recommended to evaluate for interval change.
