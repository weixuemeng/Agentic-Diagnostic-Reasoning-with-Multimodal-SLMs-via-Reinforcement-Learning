 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at an earlier time.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size,
 although positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.  There
 is associated improved aeration at the right lung base.  Diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary nodules and a right fourth anterior rib lesion are unchanged and
 consistent with known metastatic disease.
