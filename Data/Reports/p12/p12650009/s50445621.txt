 Eval ? free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, lung volumes are lower, causing crowding of

 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  No
 free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.
