                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits. There is
 minimal opacity in the medial aspect of the right lung base which could
 reflect atelectasis although early consolidation cannot be excluded.  Apart
 from minimal bibasilar linear atelectasis, the left lung appears clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion. The osseous structures show degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal opacity, medial right base, for which early consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
