 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  There is small left apical and basal pneumothorax, that
 appears to be unchange after removal of the chest CT seen.  There is overall
 no evidence of newly developed abnormalities since the prior examination with
 overall improved aeration of the lung bases.
