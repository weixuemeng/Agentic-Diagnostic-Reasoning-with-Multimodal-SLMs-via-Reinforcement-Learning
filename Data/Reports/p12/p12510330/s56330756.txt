 eval tube and line positions and interval change in pulmoary
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged except for removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. The pulmonary
 vessels are not sharply seen, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm with hazy
 opacification at the base suggests layering effusion on this side.
