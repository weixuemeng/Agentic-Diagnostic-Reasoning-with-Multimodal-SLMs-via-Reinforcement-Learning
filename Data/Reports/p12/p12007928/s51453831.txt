                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, short of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  No focal infiltrate or gross effusion.  Minimal blunting
 of the costophrenic angles posteriorly may be present.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD and upper zone redistribution.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Doubt acute pulmonary process.
