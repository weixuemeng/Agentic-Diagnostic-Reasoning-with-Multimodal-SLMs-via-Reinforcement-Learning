                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, cough, pancreatitis  // Pneumonia,
 pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs 2 read in conjunction with imaging of the lower
 chest on the abdomen CT ___.  There are no prior chest imaging
 procedures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild loss of height in the left lower lobe accompanies areas of ground-glass
 peribronchial opacification seen on yesterday's abdomen CT. Although these are
 most likely combination of either atelectasis alone or atelectasis and changes
 due to aspiration, I cannot exclude early pneumonia. The upper lungs however
 are clear. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of any central adenopathy.
 Heart size is normal
