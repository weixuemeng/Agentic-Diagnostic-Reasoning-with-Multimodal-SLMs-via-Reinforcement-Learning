  Right apical opacity is slightly increased from 3 hours prior and is not seen
  on pre-op radiographs.  While this may represent atelectasis, mediastinal
  hemorrhage should be considered.  Stable positioning of ETT, NGT right IJ
  catheter, mediastinal drain, and 2 chest tubes.  Low lung volumes, right
  basilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  Mild pleural thickening on
  the right.  D/w ___ (Cardiac surgery) at 10:06 p.m..

 HISTORY:  CABG with postoperative bleeding.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is some
 apical capping on the right that has developed.  The mediastinal contours are
 not enlarged from the previous study.  Monitoring and support devices remain
 in place.  Opacification at the right base is consistent with atelectasis and
 small effusion.
