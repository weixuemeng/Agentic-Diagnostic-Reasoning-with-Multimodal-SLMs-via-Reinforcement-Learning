                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Diaphoresis and dizziness status post CABG seven days ago,
 assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is improved
 aeration in the lower lungs as compared with recent prior exam.  Minimal
 opacity persists in the right lower lung which could represent atelectasis
 though the possibility of pneumonia is impossible to exclude.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The
 imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of lower lung opacities suggest interval
 improvement though residual atelectasis/pneumonia is impossible to exclude. 
 Continued followup is advised.
