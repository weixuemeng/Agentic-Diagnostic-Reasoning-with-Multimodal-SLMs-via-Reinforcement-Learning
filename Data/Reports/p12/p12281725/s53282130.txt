                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices, except apparently four one tube or drain on the right, have been
 removed.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications most likely
 reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
