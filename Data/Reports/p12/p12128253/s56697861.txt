                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fungemia, bacterial MSSA, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 10:29 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior from allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change. 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.0 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. Side port of the NG tube
 is not definitively identified.   Right subclavian central line tip over
 distal SVC.   A left subclavian central line tip is present, tip over mid SVC.
 No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly unchanged. There is
 vascular plethora, with hazy opacity at the left base. Increased retrocardiac
 density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. More hazy opacity throughout much of
 the left lung, question due to layering pleural fluid.  Small right effusion
 with mild underlying collapse and/or consolidation.   Focal horizontal band of
 opacity in the right mid lung, likely represents fluid in the minor fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes, as described.  Pleural parenchymal findings are
 grossly unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly
 unchanged.
