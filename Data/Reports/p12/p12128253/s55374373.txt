                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man, intubated, with MSSA bacteremia with decreased
 breath sounds on Right  // consolidation or acute change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, and could obscure what was
 questioned as developing pneumonia in the left lower lobe. An upright
 radiograph would be helpful in making that determination. Poor definition of
 the right diaphragmatic pleural interface is new and raises concern about
 developing right lower lobe pneumonia. Careful followup advised.  Right apical
 pleural drainage tube still in place.
 
 No detectable right pneumothorax. Mild cardiac enlargement unchanged.  ET tube
 and left internal jugular line are in standard placements.
