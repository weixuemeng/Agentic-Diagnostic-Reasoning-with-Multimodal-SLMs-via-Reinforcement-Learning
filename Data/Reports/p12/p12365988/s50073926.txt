                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumo      eval for pneumo
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed
 and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Continued bilateral pleural
 effusions that may be slightly more prominent than on the previous study with
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  No definite vascular congestion.  In view
 of the changes in the lower lungs, the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia
 would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
