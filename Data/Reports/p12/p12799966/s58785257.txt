                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M s/p dobhoff advancement  // eval to assess in gastrum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Dobhoff tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, however the tip is not
 visualized.  There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  The ill-defined
 opacification within the right mid and lower lung zones is unchanged.  Again
 visualized are bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
 atelectasis, also not significantly changed compared to prior.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dobhoff tube in appropriate positioning.
 2. Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with persistent opacification of the
 right mid and lower lungs likely representing alveolar edema, however an
 underlying pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
 3. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
