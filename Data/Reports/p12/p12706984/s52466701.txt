                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with worsening hypoxemia.  // Is there interval
 change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain films of the chest from 2 hours and 10 hours prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. 
 Minimal right infrahilar opacity is seen, not definitively identified on prior
 examinations, which may represent vascular crowding or atelectasis, though
 focal consolidation is not entirely excluded.  Vague new retrocardiac opacity
 is also seen, which may be related to atelectasis, though aspiration is not
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  More prominent right infrahilar and retrocardiac opacities than seen on
 most recent comparison may represent aspiration or atelectasis.
