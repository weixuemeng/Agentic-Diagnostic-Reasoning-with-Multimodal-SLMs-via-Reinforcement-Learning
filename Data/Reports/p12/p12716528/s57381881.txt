                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with respiratory failure,
 intubated, assessment for interval change.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube is in appropriate position as well as the NG tube.  The right lung
 extended consolidation as well as left lung mid and lower lobe consolidations
 are unchanged with substantial air bronchogram.  The findings might be
 consistent with a combination of pleural effusion and multifocal infection
 given the presence of preexisting right consolidations back on ___. 
 Superimposed hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  Given the slight left mediastinal
 shift, there is also potential element of left lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
