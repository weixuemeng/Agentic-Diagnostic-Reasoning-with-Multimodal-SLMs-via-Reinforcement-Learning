                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with flash pulmonary edema, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This patient presented with asymmetric right more than left opacities on ___ that rapidly deteriorated over a course of two hours.  A bronchoscopy
 was done and found no blood and no mucus plugging.  The patient is now treated
 with pneumonia.  On today's exam ET tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina.  NG
 tube is in the stomach.  The severe widespread opacities have worsened at the
 lung bases and left upper lobe, but improved in right upper lobe.  There is
 possibly adjacent pleural effusions, hard to assess.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are top normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Widespread severe lung opacities have worsened in the lower lungs and left
 upper lobe but improved in right upper lobe.  The evolution and lack of
 vascular engorgement go against pulmonary edema.  Considering that the
 bronchoscopy was negative for pulmonary hemorrhage, severe pneumonia is the
 most likely diagnosis.  
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
