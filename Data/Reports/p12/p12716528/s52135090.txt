                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent liver transplant with worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 3.7
 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the
 tip out of the field of view.  In comparison to the prior exam, there is
 worsening diffuse opacification, most prominent on the right.  There is very
 mild engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening opacification of the right lung, most likely due to diffuse
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  Other etiologies could include worsening pneumonia or
 asymmetric edema.
 2.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
