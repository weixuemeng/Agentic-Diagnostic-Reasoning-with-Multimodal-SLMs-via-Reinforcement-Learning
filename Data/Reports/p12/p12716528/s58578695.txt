                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of a prior liver transplant with cough, malaise, and
 hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is a new opacity involving the central
 portions of the right lung.  Other than mild left basilar atelectasis, the
 left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged, and appears slightly bigger than in the prior exam.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The known left lower lobe granuloma is not
 well evaluated on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New central right lung opacity.  This likely represents diffuse pulmonary
 hemorrhage; alternatively, an atypical pneumonia or new asymmetric edema are
 considerations.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly, slightly increased from the prior exam.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5:50 a.m. on ___ via telephone by
 Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
