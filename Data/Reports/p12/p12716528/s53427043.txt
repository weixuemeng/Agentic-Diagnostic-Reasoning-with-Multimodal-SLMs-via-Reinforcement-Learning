                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ M h/o liver transplant, ESRD on HD, p/w fever, also has some
 cough/sob  // e/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prior right-sided central venous catheter is no longer visualized.  There has
 been interval clearance of the dense retrocardiac opacity since prior exam. 
 Minimal bibasilar opacities are noted.  Superiorly the lungs are clear of
 consolidation and there is no effusion.  There is however nodular opacity
 projecting over the anterior right second rib.  Additional nodular opacities 1
 projecting over each lung base are presumably nipple shadows but can be
 followed at time of subsequent exam.  Moderate cardiomegaly is noted.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.  TIPS identified in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of dense retrocardiac opacity seen on previous exam. 
 There are bibasilar opacities presumably atelectasis noting that infection
 cannot be entirely excluded.
 An 8 mm nodule at the right upper lung.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Nonurgent chest CT is suggested for evaluation of suspected
 pulmonary nodule.
