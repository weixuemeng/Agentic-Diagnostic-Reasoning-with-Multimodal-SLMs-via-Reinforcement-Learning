                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and diastolic CHF.  Please evaluate for pleural
 effusions and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  On a background of emphysema, there has been interval improvement
 of the previously noted moderate pulmonary edema with minimal evidence of
 bronchial cuffing and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged compared to the prior exam. 
 Scarring and volume loss in the right middle lobe appear stable.  Again seen
 is a large irregular density projecting over the right lower lung, which
 corresponds to a large unusual branching calcification as characterized by a
 prior CT.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interval improvement of moderate pulmonary edema, with residual mild
 pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Overall, minimal interval change in the small bilateral pleural effusions.
