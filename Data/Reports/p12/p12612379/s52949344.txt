 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  COPD, hypoxemia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral effusions have
 decreased.  Adjacent bibasilar atelectases have improved.  Pulmonary edema has
 also improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Opacities described in the right
 mid lung have improved consistent with improving pulmonary edema, less likely
 reflecting infectious process.
