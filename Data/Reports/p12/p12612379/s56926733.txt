 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with known COPD, kyphoscoliosis, and
 ongoing recurrent pleural effusion and right lung nodules.  Presents with
 worsening hypoxia of unclear etiology.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study ___ ___.  The heart is not significantly enlarged and there is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates can be identified, but we on previous examination identified,
 moderate amount of pleural effusion on the right base persists.  In comparison
 with the next previous portable chest examination, there is now also evidence
 of a small amount of pleural effusion on the left side blunting the lateral
 pleural sinus.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right-sided pleural effusion and mildly increasing
 effusion on the left as well.  No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates and
 no pneumothorax.
