                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia, recent pleural effusion and productive
 cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as a CT chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  A band-like opacity projecting over the left lower
 lung, within the lingula has partly resolved.  There is also right perihilar
 opacity suggesting atelectasis or scarring predominantly in the right middle
 lobe, which is fairly similar and possibly of longer chronicity. 
 Calcifications are present within the right breast.  A pleural effusion has
 decreased in the right hemithorax.  The lateral view indicates small
 subpulmonic bilateral pleural effusions on this examination.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  A faint nipple shadow can be preserved on the right side.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are present along
 the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving right-sided pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
 Hyperinflation.  No definite evidence for acute disease.
