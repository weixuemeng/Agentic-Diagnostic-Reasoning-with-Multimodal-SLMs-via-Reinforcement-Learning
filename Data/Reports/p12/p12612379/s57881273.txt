                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, atrial fibrillation, presenting
 chest discomfort adn shortness of breath with history of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, as before, and there is increased AP diameter of
 the chest, consistent with a history of COPD. The right hemithorax is slightly
 smaller than the left, unchanged.  
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, but cardiomediastinal contour is stable.  Prominence
 of the right pulmonary arttery is again seen.  
 
 There is a small right effusion, perhaps very slightly improved, with some
 underlying atelectasis.  Scarring and volume loss in the right middle lobe
 appears stable.  Again seen is a large irregular density projecting over the
 right lower lung which corresponds to a large unusual branching calcification
 or other density in the right breast (2:31 on ___ CT). MInimal blunting
 of the left posterior costophrenic angle and minimal left base
 atelectasis/scarring is unchanged.
 
 No new infltrate is detected. No obvious ptx. No chf. 
 
 Degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.  There has been
 interval removal of the right chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 COPD and cardiogemaly. RML scarring and volume loss. Small right effusion and
 possible tiny left effusion. Howver, no  significant interval change detected
 compared with ___.   No new infiltrate, chf, or obvious pneumothorax.
