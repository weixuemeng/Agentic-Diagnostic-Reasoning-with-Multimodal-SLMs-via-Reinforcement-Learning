 Assess interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is interval
 mild increase in the bilateral pleural effusions with slight increase in
 bibasilar atelectasis.  The right mid lung opacity is similar to prior exam
 and reflects post-treatment changes of a right middle lobe mass.  There is no
 pneumothorax and there are no clear signs of pulmonary edema.  The heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis, also slightly progressed.
