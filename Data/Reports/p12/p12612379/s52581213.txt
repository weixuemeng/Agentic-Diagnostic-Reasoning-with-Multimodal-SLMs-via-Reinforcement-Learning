                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the loculated effusion on
 the right is less prominent and there is no definite evidence of pneumothorax.
 Some pleural fluid is again seen at the right costophrenic angle with
 underlying atelectatic changes in this patient with marked hyperexpansion
 consistent with COPD.  The left PICC line is difficult to assess but appears
 to be in the region of the mid SVC.  No definite left effusion is seen at this
 time.
