                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Small right pleural effusion has increased in size
 compared to the prior study.  Re- demonstrated is scarring with bronchiectasis
 and ill-defined nodular small opacities in the right middle lobe with coarse
 calcifications of the right breast.  Right basilar patchy opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in size of small right pleural effusion with right
 basilar atelectasis. Chronic bronchiectasis, scarring, and nodular opacities
 in the right middle lobe.
