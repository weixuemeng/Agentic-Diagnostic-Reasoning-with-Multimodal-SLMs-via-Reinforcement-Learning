                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, presents with shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ and a chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable
 cardiomegaly and unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours.  On a background of
 emphysema and increased moderate pulmonary edema as evidenced by bronchial
 cuffing, prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and new bilateral small
 pleural effusions in setting of cardiomegaly, there are stable sharply
 demarcated opacifications projecting over the right lower lung corresponding
 with dystrophic soft tissue breast calcifications.  An area of obliquely
 oriented opacification running from the right mid lung towards the medial
 aspect of the right lower lung corresponds with an area of atelectasis and
 bronchiectasis evident on the ___ CT.  An additional linear
 opacification projecting over the right upper lung, new on the ___
 radiograph, through less conspicuous on today's study, may be due to
 atelectasis or persistent though slightly improved pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  On background of chronic lung changes including emphysema,
 bronchiectasis and atelectasis, there is new pulmonary edema with new small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Opacifications projecting over right upper lung are less conspicuous compared
 to ___ and may be due to atelectasis or  resolving pneumonia.
