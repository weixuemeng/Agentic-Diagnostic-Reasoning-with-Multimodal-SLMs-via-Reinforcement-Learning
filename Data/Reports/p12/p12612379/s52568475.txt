                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known severe COPD, pleural effusion.  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural drain has
 been removed.  The extent of the right pleural effusion is not substantially
 increased in the interval.  On the left, there is an unchanged moderate
 pleural effusion with atelectasis at the level of the left lower lobe.  The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities are overall decreased in severity.  The
 biggest remnant opacity seen laterally of the right hilus.  The vascular
 diameters remain at the upper range of normal, so that mild fluid overload
 cannot be excluded.
