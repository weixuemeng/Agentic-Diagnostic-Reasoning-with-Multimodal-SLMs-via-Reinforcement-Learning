  No acute cardiopulmonary process. No displaced fracture seen, however, if
  there is clinical concern for rib or sternal fracture, dedicated sternal /rib
  series or chest CT are more sensitive and should be considered.
  
  Some degenerative changes seen at the lower thoracic spine with possible
  subtle anterior widening of a disc space. Correlate clinically for acuity, if
  focal symptoms related to this level, CT would provide further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with anterior thoracic cage pain  // Acute process,
 attention to rib/sternal fx to extent possible
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Breast tissue seen overlying the right hemi thorax
 but not the left. No displaced fracture is seen, however, if there is clinical
 concern for rib or sternal fracture, dedicated sternal and rib series or chest
 CT are more sensitive and should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No displaced fracture seen, however, if
 there is clinical concern for rib or sternal fracture, dedicated sternal /rib
 series or chest CT are more sensitive and should be considered.
 
 Some degenerative changes seen at the lower thoracic spine with possible
