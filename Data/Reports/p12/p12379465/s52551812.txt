                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 without change.  Band-like areas of opacity have improved in the left lower
 lobe and are worse in the right lower lobe, with additional more confluent
 opacity which has newly developed in the right lower lobe posteriorly.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater than left.  No
 pneumothorax.  Postoperative changes are present within the lower thoracic and
 upper lumbar spine, and note is also made of soft tissue gas and air-fluid
 level in the posterior chest wall, consistent with recent surgery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Coexisting aspiration or pneumonia is possible in
 posterior segment right lower lobe.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
