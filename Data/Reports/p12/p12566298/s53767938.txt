 FINDINGS:  Stable positioning of endotracheal tube with tip 3 cm above the
 carina.  Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the distal superior
 vena cava.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis evident with slightly improved
 retrocardiac opacification.  Left pleural effusion decreased, now small in
 size.  Moderately sized right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in standard postion.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions with interval decrease on the left, now small in size. Improved
 aeration of retrocardiac space.
