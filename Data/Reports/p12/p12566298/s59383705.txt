 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the lower clavicular level,
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Opacification at the right base most
 likely reflects a combination of volume loss and pleural effusion, though
 superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
