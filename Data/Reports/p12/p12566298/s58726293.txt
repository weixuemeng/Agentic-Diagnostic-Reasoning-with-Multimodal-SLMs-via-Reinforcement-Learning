                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with worsening pulmonary physical exam and
 copious respiratory secretions, coming here to evaluate for pneumonia or acute
 pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 16:33
 p.m.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low with
 elevation of both hemidiaphragms.  As compared to the preceding radiograph,
 there is a new horizontal linear opacity in the right lung base, which does
 not obscure the right hemidiaphragm likely representing compressive
 atelectasis.  A second homogeneous opacity in the lateral right lung base
 abutting the pleura is also new from the preceding radiograph and likely
 represents pleural fluid.  No pneumothorax is present.  The left lung is
 clear.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New compressive atelectasis and pleural fluid at the right lung
 base from ___.  Recommend lateral chest radiograph or lateral decubitus
 view to further assess this acute finding.
