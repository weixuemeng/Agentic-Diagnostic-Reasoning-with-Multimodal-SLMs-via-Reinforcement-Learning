                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:    The gastric band is positioned at an appropriate angle but
 projects immediately above the medial left hemidiaphragm.  The heart is at the
 upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  No free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat high-riding gastric band which may indicate that the
 band is situated in a hiatal hernia; the orientation angle appears within
 normal limits.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or free air.
