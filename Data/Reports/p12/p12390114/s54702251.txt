                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with failure to thrive, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications most pronounced at the arch. 
 Mild upper zone vascular redistribution is demonstrated with minimal streaky
 and patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multiple
 clips are noted about the thoracic inlet compatible with prior thyroidectomy. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
