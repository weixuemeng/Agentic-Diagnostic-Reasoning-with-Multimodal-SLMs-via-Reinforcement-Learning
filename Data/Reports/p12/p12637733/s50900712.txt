                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent kidney transplant (POD9)  // Incr SOB
 - etiology?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study,  the degree of upper zone redistribution is
 increased, which could reflect early /mild CHF.
 
 Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar.
 
 Patchy opacity at both lung bases and minimal blunting  of the right
 costophrenic angle is  similar.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New upper zone redistribution suggests early changes of CHF.
 
 Mild patchy opacity at both bases is unchanged.  The appearance is compatible
 with atelectasis, though early pneumonic infiltrates would be difficult to
 completely exclude.  Small right effusion is unchanged.
