                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  STERNAL DRAINAGE AFTER CABG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery with mitral valve
 replacement. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the mid superior vena cava. Other lines tubes and drains had been removed.
 Retrocardiac opacification has largely cleared. Pleural effusions have
 probably also decreased somewhat. . Sternal wires appear intact. There is a
 small focus of air immediately posterior to the sternum. However, this may be
 anticipated in the early postoperative course.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small focus of air/gas immediately posterior to the sternum without evidence
 for bone destruction or dishiscence of sternal wires.  Although it is hard to
 exclude the possibility of gas-forming infection, the presence of gas in soft
 tissues can be anticipated following very sternotomy.  Improving left basilar
 opacity and probable decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.
