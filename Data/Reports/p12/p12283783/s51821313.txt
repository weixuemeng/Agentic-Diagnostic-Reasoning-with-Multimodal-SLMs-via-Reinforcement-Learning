                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx NSTEMI, GIB, rising troponins, now with
 increased dyspnea  // New process to explain dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The PICC line is present.  The tip is not well delineated, but appears
 overlies the distal SVC, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with rotated positioning.  Allowing for
 this, again seen is cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration and
 opacification of the left lobe, which likely represents combination of left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small amount of left pleural
 fluid.  Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base and a a small right
 pleural effusion though these findings are also improved compared with ___.  Mild vascular plethora is probably also slightly improved.
 
 The undulating appearance along the lower right chest is unchanged, but raises
 question of old rib fractures.
 
 Incidental note is made of a plate and screws overlying the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacification is unchanged.  Slight interval improvement in
 vascular plethora, right base patchy opacity, and small right effusion.
