                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with upper abdominal pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT without contrast
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  The lungs are clear of lobar consolidation; in the upper
 mid portion of the left lung and the lateral subpleural space is a lucent
 lesion with a minimally dense rim, better characterized on prior chest CT. 
 The lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The previously described compression
 deformity of the L1 vertebral body is unchanged from prior CT.  Cervical
 fixation harware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes/bibasilar atelectasis, without radiographic
 evidence for pneumonia.
