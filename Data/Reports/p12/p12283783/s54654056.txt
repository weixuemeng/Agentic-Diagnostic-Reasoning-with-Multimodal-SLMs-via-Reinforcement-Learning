 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___. Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities are again noted. Rounded lucency projecting over
 left upper lung laterally is compatible with cystic subpleural lesion seen on
 prior exams. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits. Compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine is noted
 and was present on prior. Cervical fixation hardware is visualized.

 Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely atelectasis. Otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
