                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with prostate cancer, presenting with left flank
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Streaky opacities at bilateral lung bases as well as the mid left
 lung are stable and consistent with atelectasis and scarring.  No pleural
 effusion or focal consolidation on the present x-ray.  Cardiac size is stable.
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.  Previous cervical
 spinal hardware is noted in the area of the neck.
 
 A heterogeneous opacity projects over the the left scapula/lateral left upper
 rib.  This was present on the most recent prior exam as well but not dating
 further back and it is not clear if this represents a rib or scapular
 abnormality. If there is concern for metastatic prostate cancer, a bone scan
 would be helpful to evaluate this area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable plate-like
 atelectasis.
 2) Heterogeneous opacity projecting over the left scapula/lateral upper left
 rib.  If there is concern for metastatic prostate cancer, a bone scan or CT
 would be helpful to evaluate.
