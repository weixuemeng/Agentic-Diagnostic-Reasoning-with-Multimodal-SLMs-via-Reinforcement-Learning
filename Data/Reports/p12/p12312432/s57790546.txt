                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal. The aorta remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are
 similar, with enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis. Lungs remain hyperinflated. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  8 mm nodular opacity within the left mid
 lung field is new compared to the prior exams.  Posterior spinal fusion
 hardware is partially visualized within the upper thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia. New 8 mm nodular opacity within the left mid lung
 field.  This could reflect a metastasis and can be better assessed with chest
 CT.
