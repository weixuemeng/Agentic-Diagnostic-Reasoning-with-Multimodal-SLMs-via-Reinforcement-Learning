                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  Overlying EKG leads are present.  There is diffuse subtle
 increase in hazy opacity throughout the lungs which could reflect
 underpenetrated status and portable technique, less likely edema.  Aside from
 this, there is no focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Findings as above.  If there is further concern, recommend a dedicated PA and
 lateral view of the chest to further assess.
