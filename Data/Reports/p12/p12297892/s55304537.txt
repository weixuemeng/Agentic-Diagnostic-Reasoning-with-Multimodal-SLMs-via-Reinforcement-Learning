                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M who fell, sustained head injuries, evaluate for rib
 fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Subsegmental right basilar
 atelectasis is seen, but there is no focal consolidation.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 is likely due to mild chronic pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  No displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No definite displaced fracture seen. 
 If there is continued concern for rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib
 series.
