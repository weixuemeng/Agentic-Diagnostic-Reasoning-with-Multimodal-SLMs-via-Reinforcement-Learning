                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic pancreatic cancer and right sided
 port  // Please assess port placement prior to accessing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a right pectoral MediPort projects over the lower SVC. There is no
 pneumothorax. Bilateral coarse reticular nodular opacities have slightly
 increased at the left lung base.  The presence of chronic fibrotic lung
 disease makes it difficult to exclude small pulmonary metastases. Correlation
 with cross-sectional imaging if not already obtained would be helpful. A right
 upper quadrant stent is again noted. A radiopaque object with both rounded and
 triangular components projecting over the right lung base is likely external
 to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in heterogeneous opacities at the left lung base,
 which may be due to developing infection. The presence of chronic fibrotic
 lung disease makes it difficult to exclude small pulmonary metastases.
 Correlation with cross-sectional imaging would be helpful.
