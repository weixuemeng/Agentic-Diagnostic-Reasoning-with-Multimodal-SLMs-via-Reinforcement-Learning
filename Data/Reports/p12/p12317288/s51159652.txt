                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatic cancer and mets  // baseline
 chest xray.  Lungs sound consolidated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely increased reticulonodular interstitial densities likely represent
 chronic interstitial lung disease. Diffusely increased densities could hide a
 small pulmonary metastases. Chest CT is recommended for further
 characterization of interstitial lung disease and evaluation for possible
 metastases.  The right chest wall port ends in the mid SVC.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  Heart size is normal and
 pulmonary vessels are not congested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial densities compatible with chronic interstitial lung
 disease, a chest CT is recommended for further characterization and evaluation
 for possible pulmonary metastases.
