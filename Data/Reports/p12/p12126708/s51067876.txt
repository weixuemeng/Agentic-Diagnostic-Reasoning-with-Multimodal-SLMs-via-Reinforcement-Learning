                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pna  // evidence of worsening pna,
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:11
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An ET tube is present. The tip is not well delineated but is probably similar
 in position, approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip
 beneath diaphragm, off film. A left subclavian central line is present, tip
 over SVC/RA junction or possibly upper right atrium.
 
 Bibasilar opacities and smallright-greater-than-left bilateral effusions with
 vascular plethora are similar to the prior study. As before, while this may
 reflect pulmonary edema, the differential could include a pneumonic
 infiltrate.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change compared 1 day earlier.
