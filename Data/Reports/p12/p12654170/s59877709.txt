                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Intra-aortic balloon pump has been withdrawn slightly, now
 terminating about 4.8 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. 
 Multifocal areas of consolidation in the lingula and both lower lobes has
 slightly improved, but the lingular consolidation has a rounded mass-like
 configuration.  Of note, the lingular consolidation has not cleared since the
 radiograph of ___.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for pulmonary
 vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema as well as a persistent
 small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pneumonia, but residual lingular
 consolidation has a mass-like configuration. Considering the presence of a
 lingular abnormality since ___, the possibility of a malignant
 mass in this region should be considered, and CT may be helpful for further
 assessment when the patient's condition allows.
