                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large area of consolidation and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion at the
 base of the left hemithorax is stable.  There is greater consolidation
 developing at the base of the right lung, accompanied by a smaller pleural
 effusion.  Previous vascular congestion has improved slightly.  Cardiac
 silhouette is obscured and given the presence of infection in the left
 hemithorax, possibility of pericardial effusion should be entertained.  There
 is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, however, to suggest tamponade
 physiology.
