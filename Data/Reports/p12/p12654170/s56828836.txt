                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple skin folds are present bilaterally, but there are no
 visible pneumothoraces.  Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  Intra-aortic
 balloon pump remains in place with tip terminating about 4 cm below the
 superior aspect of the aortic knob.  Bilateral asymmetrically distributed
 perihilar and basilar opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree
 than the right, have slightly worsened in the interval.  Moderate-to-large
 left pleural effusion tracking to the left apex has also increased.
