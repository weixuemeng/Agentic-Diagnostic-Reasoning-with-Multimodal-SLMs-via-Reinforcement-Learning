                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with colitis presenting with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderately low lung volume bilaterally with no areas of
 focal consolidation suspicious for infection.  A retrocardiac opacity is again
 observed, consistent with atelectasis and essentially unchanged from prior
 study.  There are no masses, lesions, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 aorta is tortuous but not dilated; otherwise the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable. There are
 stable mild multilevel degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of infection or malignancy.
