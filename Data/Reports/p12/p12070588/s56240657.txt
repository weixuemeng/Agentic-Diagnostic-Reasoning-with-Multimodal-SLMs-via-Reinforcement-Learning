 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the right atrium, without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Left greater than right basilar reticular opacities could be
 due to atypical infection, but pulmonary hemorrhage is not entirely excluded
 given patient history.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
