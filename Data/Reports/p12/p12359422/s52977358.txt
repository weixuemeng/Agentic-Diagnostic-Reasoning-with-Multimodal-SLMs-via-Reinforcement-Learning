                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Retrocardiac and right basilar patchy opacities may reflect areas of
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.  Blunting of both
 costophrenic angles suggest small bilateral pleural effusions.  No definite
 pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected. 
 Kyphosis and diffuse demineralization of the thoracic spine is again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly limited exam due to patient rotation.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may
 reflect atelectasis, however infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
