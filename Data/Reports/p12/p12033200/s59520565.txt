                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with schizophrenia,  evaluate for Pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes in the suboptimal inspiratory effort.  There is
 mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are obscured. 
 Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm likely relates to
 basilar atelectasis in the setting of a suboptimal inspiratory effort, however
 infection or sequela of of aspiration are possible in the correct clinical
 setting.  There is no focal consolidation elsewhere.   There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects basilar
 atelectasis, however infection or aspiration may produce a similar appearance,
 and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted
 clinically.
 2. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
