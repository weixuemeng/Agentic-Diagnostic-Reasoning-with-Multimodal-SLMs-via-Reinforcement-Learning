                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is calcified.  Hilar contours are stable and
 unremarkable.  The lungs are highly inflated with flattening of the diaphragm,
 similar to prior.  No pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis and small
 anterior endplate osteophytes in the thoracic spine are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence for pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 2. Persistent pulmonary hyperinflation may reflect obstructive airways
 disease.  Please correlate clinically.
