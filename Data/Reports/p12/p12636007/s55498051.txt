                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison; however, a CT neck from ___
 was concurrently reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina
 and is optimally positioned.  Superior mediastinal widening related to
 hematoma in the thyroid bed is better evaluated on recent CT neck dated
 ___.  The heart size and hilar contours are normal.  Mild left lower
 lung atelectasis is present.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.
