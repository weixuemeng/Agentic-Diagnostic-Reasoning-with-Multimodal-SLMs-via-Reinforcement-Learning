                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, intubated, question ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph is provided.  ET tube is located
 approximately 3 cm above the carina in appropriate position.  An NG tube
 courses right to the GE junction and should be advanced.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is a retrocardiac opacity with decreased lung volume on
 the left consistent possibly due to left lower lobe atelectasis.  There may be
 a small left pleural effusion.  There is prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears shifted towards the left unchanged since the prior exam and
 may be due to volume loss on the left. Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 
 2.  NG tube should be advanced into the stomach.
 
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity with shift of the mediastinum towards the left,
 possibly due to volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Possible small left
 pleural effusion or superimposed infection.
