 lower hemi thorax.  Right pleural effusion is small and loculated, if any. 
 More likely this is a thickening of the costal pleural surface.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung is exaggerated by lower lung volume.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly stable.  ET tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends
 in the right atrium.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a
 nondistended stomach.  No left pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
