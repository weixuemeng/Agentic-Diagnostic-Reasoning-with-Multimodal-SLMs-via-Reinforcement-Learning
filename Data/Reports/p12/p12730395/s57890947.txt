                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R sided pleural effusion s/p ___Fr for
 drainage with possible loculations  // Eval for interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post right sided chest tube insertion.  The chest tube
 is difficult to visualize but is grossly unchanged in position, the tip
 appears to be close to the mediastinum.  There is a persistent right basal
 pneumothorax, similar in extent when compared to the prior study.  There is a
 small right-sided pleural effusion.  Increased airspace opacity in the right
 mid lung likely reflects atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  Previous median sternotomy noted, surgical clips consistent with
 coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The left lung is grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
