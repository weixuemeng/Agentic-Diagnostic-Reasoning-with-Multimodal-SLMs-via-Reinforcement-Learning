 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 Lung volumes are low. Patient is rotated to her right. The heart is top-normal
 in size. There is apparent hilar prominence which is suboptimally assessed due
 to rotation. Mild edema difficult to exclude without overt signs of pneumonia,
 effusion or pneumothorax. The right lung apex is suboptimally assessed due to
 rotation. No displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to patient rotation with possible mild edema. Consider repeat
 exam if needed to better assess. Consider dedicated rib series if there is
 strong concern for rib fracture.
