                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild haziness of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of
 mild increased central venous pulmonary pressure.  Post-CABG changes are again
 visualized and the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stably moderately
 enlarged.  Biventricular pacemaker appears normal in place.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps minimal edema with no acute cardiopulmonary process
 otherwise identified.
