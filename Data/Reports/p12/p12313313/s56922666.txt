                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic respiratory failure  // worsening
 pulmonary findings?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, and allowing for differences in positioning, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Again seen is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  The hazy opacity at the left lung base is not
 appreciated on the current film, question interval resolution.  There is new
 increased density at the right lung base, which could represent a combination
 of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, not fully
 characterized on this single view.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  This is probably slightly
 improved.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though the more hazy
 component seen on yesterday's film has resolved.  It is possible this latter
 finding represented alveolar edema related to CHF.
 
 New opacity at the right lung base, not fully characterized, but could
 represent a combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Given differences in  patient positioning between the 2 films,
 some of this could reflect extension of the cardiac silhouette, but that
 likely does not account for the entire opacity.
 
 Mild CHF, improved compared with the film from 1 day earlier.
