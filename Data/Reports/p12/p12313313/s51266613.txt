  1. Heterogeneous multifocal airspace opacities are seen bilaterally.  This may
  represent sequela of extensive aspiration or a multifocal infectious process.
  2. The enteric tube tip ends in the stomach, but the last side port is at the
  level of the GE junction.  This should be advanced prior to use.
  3. ET tube ends 4.3 cm from the carina.
