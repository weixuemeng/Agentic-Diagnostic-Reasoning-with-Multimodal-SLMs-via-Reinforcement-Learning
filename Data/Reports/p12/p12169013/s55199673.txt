                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of heroin and benzodiazepine
 overdose.  Evaluate for interval change in diffuse opacities.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina.  NG tube terminates near the
 pylorus.  Extensive, bilateral alveolar opacities with improved aeration in
 the upper lungs bilaterally. Increased distance between the left hemidiaphragm
 and intestinal gas suggests a possible left subpulmonic effusion.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive alveolar opacities with improved aeration in the upper lungs may
 reflect resolving aspiration, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or noncardiogenic
 pulmonary edema.
