 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 00:53, and chest CT ___

 There has been no significant interval change compared to the prior radiograph
 performed on ___ at 00:53.  Lungs are free of focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Stimulator device projects over the left
 anterior chest wall.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.  However,
 note that a chest radiograph is not sensitive for the detection of chest wall
 trauma.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If there is persistent clinical concern for
 a rib fracture, dedicated rib series directed at areas of focal findings
 should be performed.
