                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p RUL wedge // eval for tube placement and post
 op appearance
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacer and leads are in stable position.  A chest tube overlies
 the right hemi thorax.  Increased density at the apex of the right lung likely
 reflects atelectasis and possible, focal hemorrhage status post right upper
 lobe wedge resection. Bilateral pulmonary opacities and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement likely reflects chronic heart failure.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Post biopsy atelectasis and/or focal hemorrhage. No pneumothorax. Bilateral
 opacities and pulmonary vascular engorgement likely reflect chronic heart
 failure.
