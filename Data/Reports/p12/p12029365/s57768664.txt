                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p VATS RUL wedge ___ for 3.2cm RUL lesion FGD avid with
 negative biopsies  // interval xray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes continue to remain low.  Unchanged position of pacemaker
 projecting over the left mid zone and lateral chest wall with intact pacer
 wires.  There are new patchy opacities in the right lower lobe that may
 represent atelectasis and/ or consolidation.  Continued interval resolution of
 right upper lobe hematoma seen.  There is interval mild improvement in left
 retrocardiac opacities.  No pleural effusion.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax
 Visualized bones are unchanged.  There are multiple air-fluid levels in the
 stomach and, presumably in the transverse colonic loops, partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with new patchy opacities in the right lower lobe may
 represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Aspiration pneumonitis is a
 possibility in the right clinical setting.
 2. Continued interval improvement in right upper lobe hematoma and left
 retrocardiac opacities.
 3. Tiny right apical pneumothorax.
