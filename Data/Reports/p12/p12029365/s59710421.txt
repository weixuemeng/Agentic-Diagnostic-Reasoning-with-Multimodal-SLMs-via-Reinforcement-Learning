                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea, CP  // eval CHF, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Right basilar opacity is likely a reflection of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, increased compared the prior study, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There is no significant left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right upper paramediastinal
 density appears smaller compared to prior and is likely related to prior VATS.
 Pulmonary edema is worsened compared to the most recent prior study and is
 moderate to severe.  Left chest wall dual lead pacemaker defibrillator is
 present with tip terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as
 expected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with right basilar opacity, likely a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.
