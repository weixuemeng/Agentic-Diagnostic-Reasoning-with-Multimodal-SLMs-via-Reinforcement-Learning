 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:46 PM
  1.  Slight improvement in now mild to moderate central pulmonary vascular
  congestion and interstitial edema.
  2.  Low lung volumes with asymmetric opacity overlying the right lower lobe,
  which may represent atelectasis although superimposed infection is difficult
  to exclude.
  3.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M with a h/o CAD, admitted with chest pain and dyspnea, with
 hypoxemic respiratory failure  // concern for pulmonary edema versus pneumonia
 concern for pulmonary edema versus pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema which was new on ___ has nearly resolved. 
 Lung volumes have improved, but there is still substantial consolidation in
 the right lower lobe, either atelectasis or pneumonia, accompanied by moderate
 right pleural effusion.  Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion
 remain.
 
 Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads
