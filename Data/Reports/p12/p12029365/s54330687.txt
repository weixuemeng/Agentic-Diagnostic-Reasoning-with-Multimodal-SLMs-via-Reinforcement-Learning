                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacer/ defibrillator and dual leads are in unchanged position. 
 The heart is enlarged but stable in size from the prior examination on ___.
 Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities are increased from the
 prior examination and asymmetrically involve the right lung.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 as before.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Persistent
 right apical opacity likely represents a small, resolving hematoma associated
 with prior chest tube placement, which is decreased in size from multiple
 prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities suggest pulmonary edema, which asymmetrically
 involves the right lung however concurrent infection should be considered in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.
