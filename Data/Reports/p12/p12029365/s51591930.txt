                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, dyspnea, CP  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a left chest pacer defibrillator,
 its leads appear intact and in unchanged position relative to prior study. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 without opacity convincing for pneumonia.  Calcified pleural plaques are
 visualized as punctate calcific densities over the bilateral lungs.  Surgical
 chain sutures seen in the right upper lung medially.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is consistent with a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No air under the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion.
