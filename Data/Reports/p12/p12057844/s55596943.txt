                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with incomplete prior study due to underpenetration.
 // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ 21:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is again somewhat limited however, better than examination from
 approximately 1 hr prior.  There has been no relevant change compared to that
 study with re- demonstration of a retrocardiac opacity with possible subtle
 posterior correlate on lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No relevant change compared to study from 1 are prior. This study is
 technically superior to the prior and re- demonstrates a retrocardiac opacity,
 probably atelectasis though a subtle underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the appropriate clinical context.
