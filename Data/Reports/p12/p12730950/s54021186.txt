                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with retrocardiac opacity, persistently tachycardic now s/p
 3L.  // worsened pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 23:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The appearance of the left retrocardiac opacity has significantly improved,
 likely due to improved aeration on the current exam.   Right lung is clear. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar structures and cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There are chronic resorptive changes in the distal
 right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant improvement in left basilar opacity, likely due the improved
 aeration on the current exam.  Residual left basilar opacity may be
 atelectasis, although infection cannot be ruled out.
