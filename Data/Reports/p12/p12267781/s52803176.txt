                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diffuse ribs and chest pain after assault, evaluate for
 pneumothorax or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Faint opacification on the lateral view
 with no clear correlate on the right may reflect atelectasis versus patient
 positioning.  No definite pneumonia or aspiration evident.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  No displaced rib fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint lower lung opacification on lateral view without correlate
 on frontal view likely reflects atelectasis or patient positioning.  No rib
 fractures or pneumothorax.
