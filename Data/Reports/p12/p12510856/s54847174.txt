                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed status post NG tube, question tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  The lower left chest wall and left
 costophrenic angle are excluded from the film.  
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies
 the stomach in the left upper quadrant.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly
 elevated, with minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region.  No CHF,
 frank consolidation or gross effusion.  Diaphragmatic contour is unchanged
 compared with ___.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
