                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assessment of percutaneous pacemaker position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to
 prior studies.  Pacemaker leads from a left pectoral bielectrode pacer pass
 through the SVC and end in the upper atrium and the right ventricle
 respectively.  Precise location is only possible with ultrasound correlation
 with the patient's complex cardiac anatomy.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Small sternotomy wires suggest prior corrective surgery in
 childhood.  Focal round opacity containing two linear radiodense lines and
 calcification over the left cardiac contour are likely from the patient's
 prior mitral valve and patch leak repair respectively.  Fragments of four
 implantable pacer leads project over the lower midline.  Normal pleural and
 mediastinal surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION: Pacemaker leads from a left pectoral bielectrode pacer pass
 through the SVC and end in the upper atrium and the right ventricle
 respectively.
