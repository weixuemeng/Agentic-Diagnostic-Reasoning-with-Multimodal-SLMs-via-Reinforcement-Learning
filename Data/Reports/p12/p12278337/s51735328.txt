                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and recent pneumonia.  Rule out acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT
 thoracic and lumbar spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS and IMPRESSION:  Frontal and lateral view of the chest.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with expansion in the AP dimension, consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Atelectasis and pleural thickening is again
 seen at the left lung base, and the abnormal upward bulging contour of the
 left diaphragmatic pleural surface is longstanding. There are no definite
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.  
 
 An elliptical 10mm wide nodule projecting over the left fourth rib anteriorly
 could be rib calcification, but a CT scan would be needed to exclude a lung
 nodule.  
 
 The heart size is normal and the mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Calcifications are again seen in the aortic arch.  
 
 ED QA nurses were notified by email of alteration from initial reading.
