                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, hypoxia. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is redemonstration
 of biapical scarring.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with chronic
 lung disease.  There is re- demonstration of atelectasis and pleural
 thickening at the left lung base with abnormal bulging of the left
 diaphragmatic pleural surface which appears chronic. Increased interstitial
 lung markings likely relate to chronic lung changes. There is new increased
 opacity at the right lung base which may be related to atelectasis, however
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Previously
 identified nodule over the left fourth rib does not appear to lie within the
 parenchyma.  
 
 IMPRESSION: New increased right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis,
 however pneumonia cannot be excluded.
