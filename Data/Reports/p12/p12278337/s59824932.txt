                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea, mild fever  // c/f pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased.  The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities appear denser than before and more
 widespread in distribution.  This change, however, could be caused by the
 decrease in lung volume. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 new parenchymal opacities.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
