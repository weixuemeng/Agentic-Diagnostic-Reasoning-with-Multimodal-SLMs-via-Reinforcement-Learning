                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion with perihilar haziness, new from the recent study.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, more so in
 the retrocardiac region, appear slightly progressed from the prior study
 earlier today, either reflecting worsening atelectasis or infection.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly worse in the interval.
 
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis or infection, and
 appear slightly increased compared to the prior exam from earlier today.
