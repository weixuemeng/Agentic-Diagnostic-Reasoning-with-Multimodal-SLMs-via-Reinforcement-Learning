 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemopytsis  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Appearance of the left hemi thorax is similar compared to the prior study. 
 Left pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. Since the prior study, 6 days
 prior, there has been development of several patchy opacities over the right
 mid to lower lung, worrisome for pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage ;
 underlying malignancy is felt less likely due to short-term interval
 development.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New multifocal consolidations in the right lung concerning for pneumonia a
 and/or pulmonary hemorrhage given hemoptysis; underlying malignancy is felt
