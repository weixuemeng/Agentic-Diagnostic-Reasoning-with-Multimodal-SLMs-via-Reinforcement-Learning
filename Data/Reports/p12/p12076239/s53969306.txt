                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with asthmatic bronchitis, history of
 prostate cancer and hypertension, evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and remains
 within normal limits.  Mild general widening of thoracic aorta is noted, but
 no local contour abnormalities or wall calcifications are seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of new acute parenchymal
 infiltrates.  Similar as noted on the previous examination, there are some
 signs of hyperinflated bases and linear densities representing scar
 formations.  These findings are compatible with some COPD conceivable with a
 history of asthmatic bronchitis as seen in this patient.  Acute new
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  Similar as on the previous examination,
 there are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine in the form of
 osteophytic bridging prominences, but no vertebral body compression fracture
 is seen.
