  Possible bilateral pleural effusions with pleural-based thickening and/or
  prominent extrapleural fat.  More rounded opacity posterior on the lateral
  view may be due to loculated fluid however underlying focal parenchymal
  opacity is possible.  Correlation with prior imaging would be helpful to
  document stability.  If not available, CT should be performed to further
  characterize, the acuity of which can be determined clinically

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with nausea, vomiting  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pleural based opacities, right greater than left are possible bilateral
 pleural effusions with possible pleural thickening and/or prominent pleural
 fat.  Opacity on the lateral view posteriorly may be a loculated effusion
 however, an underlying focal parenchymal opacity is possible.  There is
 associated bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac
 silhouette is obscured by the pleural fluid.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.   Vascular stent projects over the left upper chest. 
 Vascular stents project in the left subclavian/axillary regions.
