                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mandibular fracture with L upper anterior
 chest wall erythema and tenderness to palpation  // ? rib fracture     ? rib
 fracture
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.  Lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  No displaced rib for clavicle fracture is seen.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is
 seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
