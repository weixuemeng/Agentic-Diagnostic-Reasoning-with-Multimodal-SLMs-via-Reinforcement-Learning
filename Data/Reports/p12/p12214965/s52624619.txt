                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change. Known left  hilar abnormality is seen to better detail on recent CT
 and PET-CT studies. Postoperative volume loss is present in the left
 hemithorax consistent with prior lobectomy procedure.  Pleural opacities at
 the left apex and lateral costophrenic sulcus likely represent postoperative
 pleural thickening.  No focal areas of consolidation are present within the
 lungs to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
