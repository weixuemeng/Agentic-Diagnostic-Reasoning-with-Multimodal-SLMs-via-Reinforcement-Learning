                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and upper respiratory infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  There is mild perihilar vascular
 congestion.  Retrocardiac opacities are better seen on the lateral view
 projecting over spine.  Right lung base opacities likely represent
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacities, may represent
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
