                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This causes the heart size to be accentuated,
 appearing mildly enlarged.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic
 arch are present.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no
 overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Assessment of the lung bases is limited due
 to low lung volumes.  Mild atelectasis is seen at the lung bases, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded. 
 Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort once the
 patient is able to better assess the lung bases.
