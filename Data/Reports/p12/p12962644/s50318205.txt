 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  New fever and elevated white blood count.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Mediastinal widening is due to tortuosity of the
 vessels.  There is a faint opacity in the left lower lobe, worrisome for
 infection given the clinical symptoms.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
