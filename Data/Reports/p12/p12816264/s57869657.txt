                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There is
 slight upper zone redistribution.  Slight crowding of markings at the lung
 bases, and, on the lateral view, over the lingula/middle lobe and lower lobe. 
 While this may represent atelectasis due to low lung volumes, the possibility
 of an early infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No frank consolidation
 and no effusion is identified.
