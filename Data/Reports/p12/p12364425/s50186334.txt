                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe abdominal pain after surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is persistent opacification
 at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the
 right lower lobe.  There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits.  The right IJ
 catheter remains in place but the nasogastric tube appears to have been
 removed.  In the absence of a true upright image, the possibility of free
 intraperitoneal gas cannot be excluded.
