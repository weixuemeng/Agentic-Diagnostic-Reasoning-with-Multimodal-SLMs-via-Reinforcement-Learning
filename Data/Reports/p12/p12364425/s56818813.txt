                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Small-bowel obstruction, status post ex lap, CO2
 retention post-op.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric tube is again seen coursing below the level  of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.  There is persistent
 left base opacity which may be due to atelectasis with possible small pleural
 effusion.  A trace right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left base opacity, likely combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.
