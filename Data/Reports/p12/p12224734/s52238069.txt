                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:   ___-year-old woman with a mediastinal neuroendocrine tumor. 
 Evaluate for interval growth of mediastinal mass.  Clinical concern for early
 SVC syndrome.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe, abnormal convexity of the right mediastinal border with visualization
 of the pulmonary vessels is consistent with the known anterior mediastinal
 mass.  Interval change in the size of the right mediastinal mass cannot be
 adequately determined due to the differences in lung volume and technique
 compared to the prior exam from ___; however, the mass appears
 grossly larger on the lateral view.  Recommend CT chest with contrast for
 better assessment.  Interval improvement in bibasilar atelectasis.  Stable,
 mild cardiomegaly.  Left hilar contours are normal. No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right, prevascular mediastinal mass appears grossly larger on the lateral
 view.  Recommend CT chest with contrast for more adequate assessment of size
 and vascular complications.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest with contrast for better assessment of right
 mediastinal mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:27 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
