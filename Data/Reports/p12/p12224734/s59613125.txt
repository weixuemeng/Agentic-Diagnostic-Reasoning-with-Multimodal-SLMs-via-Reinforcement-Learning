 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  Large areas of lung are
 obscured by the very large cardiac silhouette, and although the frontal view
 suggests right infrahilar consolidation, there is no corresponding finding on
 the lateral. Right pleural effusion is tiny.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is comparable in its great size and shape to prior
 images, indicating large pericardial effusion persists.
 
 Deflection of the trachea the thoracic inlet is due to a large goiter.
