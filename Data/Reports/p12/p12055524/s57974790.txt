                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute onset CP, SOB, leukocytosis eval for PNA 
 // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally
 ___ relate to underlying pulmonary emphysema versus mild interstitial edema. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Biapical pleural thickening is seen, right greater than left.  Best seen on
 the lateral view 1.3 by 1.0 cm rounded calcification projects at over the
 posterior costophrenic ___, ___ represent calcified granuloma.  The aorta
 is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  There are
 compression deformities of several vertebral bodies of the lower thoracic
 spine and upper lumbar spine, not well assessed on this study and of overall
 indeterminate age given lack of priors for comparison, although likely old.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD.  Possible mild interstitial edema.
 
 Multiple compression deformities along the spine, not well assessed on this
 study and of indeterminate age, but felt likely old.
