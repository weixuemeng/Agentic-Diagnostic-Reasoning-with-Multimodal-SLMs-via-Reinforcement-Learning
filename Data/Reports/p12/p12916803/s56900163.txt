                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CTs available from ___ as well as a more recent
 PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  Surgical clips project along the left anterior chest wall. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a patchy left lower
 lobe opacity and atelectasis in the left lower lobe, probably unchanged and
 chronic.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy persistent left lower lobe opacity, likely correlating
 with airway inflammation and mucus impaction on prior studies, without
 definite evidence for acute superimposed disease.
