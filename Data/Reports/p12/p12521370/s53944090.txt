                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple myeloma, pathologic cervical
 fracture, fever to 103, no cough or SOB  // ?pneumonia, aware that patient had
 CXR in past 24 hours, CXR very rotated making findings unclear therefore we
 are repeating CXR    ?pneumonia, aware that patient had CXR in past 24 hours,
 CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain very low, but on this examination patient positioning is
 less rotated, giving a reasonable view of all of the lungs except for the
 infra hilar right lower lobe where there could be consolidation.  Lungs
 otherwise are clear although the pulmonary vasculature remains engorged. 
 Widening of the supra cardiac mediastinum suggests venous distention, probably
 due to volume overload.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Pleural effusions small if
 any at all.  No pneumothorax.
