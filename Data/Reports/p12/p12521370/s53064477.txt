                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  QUESTION PNEUMONIA CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right-sided indwelling catheter tip overlies the distal SVC, unchanged.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Possible interval obscuration of the left costophrenic angle which
 could reflect either early collapse and/or consolidation or a small effusion. 
 The apparent changes likely  accentuated by underpenetrated technique,
 however.   There is mild vascular engorgement slightly more pronounced.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild increase in vascular engorgement.
 2. Interval obscuration of the left costophrenic angle.  -- question small
 pleural effusion or early left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  If
 clinically indicated, an AP chest x-ray with increased inspiration and
 increased penetration and/or a lateral view could help for further assessment.
