                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with alcohol and cocaine use, status post fall, now
 with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Views of the right clavicle ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, without pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 A distal right clavicular fracture is again noted, nondisplaced fractures of
 the left lateral seventh through possibly tenth ribs are present, but not
 optimally evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute chest abnormality.
 
 2.  Left-sided rib fractures, described above, not completely evaluated. 
 These would be better seen with dedicated rib views after placement of a BB
 marker to mark the site of pain, if present.
 
 3.  Redemonstration of right distal clavicular fracture, unchanged.
