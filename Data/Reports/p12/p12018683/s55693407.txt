                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter has been removed.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Dishiscences among upper
 sternal wires appear unchanged.  The heart is mildly enlarged with a globular
 configuration.  Fissures appear thickened, particularly in the right lung,
 although there is no evidence for pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 There is a widespread new interstitial abnormality, although more extensive on
 the right than left, concerning for interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread interstitial abnormality, although asymmetric and
 greater on the right than left.  Although this appearance is suspected to
 reflect fluid overload, noting asymmetry differential considerations may
 include pneumonia in addition to a somewhat asymmetric pattern of pulmonary
 edema.
