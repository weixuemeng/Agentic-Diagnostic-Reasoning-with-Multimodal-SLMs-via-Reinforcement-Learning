                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history ___ ___'s disease presenting with
 dysphagia.  Evaluate for esophageal mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 No focal opacities are seen suggestive of pneumonia. Calcified granuloma in
 the right upper lung is seen. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The aorta is tortuous. Prominent marginal osteophytes in the
 right aspect of the thoracic spine result in displacement of the right
 paraspinal line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Otherwise, unremarkable chest radiographic
 examination.
