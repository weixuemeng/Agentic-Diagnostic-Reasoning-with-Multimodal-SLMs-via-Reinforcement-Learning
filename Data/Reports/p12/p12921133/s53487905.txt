                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weakness and falls.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest x-rays dating back to ___ with most
 recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are seen.  Again seen is a calcified right apical pulmonary nodule. 
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear without large effusion, consolidation or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette appears slightly
 enlarged but likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Probable calcified right hilar nodes are also
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
