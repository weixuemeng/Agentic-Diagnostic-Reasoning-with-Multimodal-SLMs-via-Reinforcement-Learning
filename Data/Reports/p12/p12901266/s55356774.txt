                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known aortic stenosis and coronary artery
 disease, isolated episode of dizziness.
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Lung volumes are low, with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity is most compatible with atelectasis. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural parenchymal
 scarring is noted.  Heart size is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and calcified.  There are severe degenerative changes at the right
 glenohumeral joint, with bone-on-bone contact, subchondral sclerosis and cyst
 formation.  Total left glenohumeral prosthesis is also present, partially
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
