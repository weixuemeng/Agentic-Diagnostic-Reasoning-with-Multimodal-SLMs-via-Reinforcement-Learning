                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB s/p surgery.  // Compare to prior
 study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PICC line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC. Than the prior study
 there is development of multifocal opacities that might represent interval
 development of interstitial pulmonary edema. Reassessment after diuresis is
 required to exclude the possibility of underlying effusion. There is on the
 other hand slight improvement in the left basal consolidation and decrease in
 the left pleural effusion.
