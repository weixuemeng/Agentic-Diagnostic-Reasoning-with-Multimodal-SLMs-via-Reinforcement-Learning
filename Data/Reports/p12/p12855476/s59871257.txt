                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased O2 requirement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 9:59 a.m., there has been some interval clearing at
 the right base, with improvement in the degree of opacity, better definition
 of the hemidiaphragm, and of the cardiophrenic angle.  Minimal residual
 opacity, question atelectasis and residual infiltrate remains visible.  At the
 left lung base, there may have been slight interval improvement, with a small
 left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation remains present. 
 The upper zone vessels are smaller, and the degree of vascular plethora has
 improved, consistent with improving CHF findings.  
 
 PICC line tip remains visible over the proximal/mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement at the right greater than left bases and in
 the CHF findings.  Residual left greater than right basilar abnormalities
 remain visible.  No pneumothorax is identified.
