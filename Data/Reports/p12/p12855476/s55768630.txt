 interval assessment      interval assessment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  There is continued increased opacification at the left base
 with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and pleural effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply
 seen, consistent with improving effusion and atelectasis on this side.
 
 Again there is evidence of previous cervical fusion.
