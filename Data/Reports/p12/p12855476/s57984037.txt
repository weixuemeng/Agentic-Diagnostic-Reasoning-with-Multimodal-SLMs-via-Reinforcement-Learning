                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent anterior cervical surgery for infection, increasing
 secretions.  Evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 A left subclavian PIC line tip is poorly visualized, but probably overlies the
 upper/mid SVC, similar to the prior study.
 
 Compared with ___, there is new prominent opacity at both lung bases. 
 This seems to represent a combination of bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation, probably with an associated small amount of pleural fluid on
 both sides.  There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora,
 suggesting early CHF.  The heart is mildly enlarged and is probably more
 pronounced than on the prior film from ___.  
 
 Again noted is hardware overlying the cervical spine, not fully evaluated. 
 Rounded structure overlying the left upper quadrant could represent a G-tube,
 best correlated with known clinical history.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New bibasilar opacities, likely a combination of bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation and small effusions.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly, probably increased.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, suggestive of early CHF.
