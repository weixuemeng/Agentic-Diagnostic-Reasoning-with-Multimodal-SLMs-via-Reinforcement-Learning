                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of CHF and hypoxia
 postoperatively.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 Comparison to prior study, ___ at 23:47.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 15:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer is unchanged.  Interval decrease in lung
 volumes with perihilar vascular congestion and linear opacity at the right
 base, which likely represents patchy atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in technique and
 positioning between studies.
