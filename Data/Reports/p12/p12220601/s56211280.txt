                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest were examined.
 
 The heart size is normal.  There is an abnormal lobular contour of the
 aortopulmonary window, which may be due to lymphadenopathy.  There are
 increased perihilar interstitial markings of uncertain chronicity.  There is
 no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Somewhat lobular contour of the aortopulmonary window, which may be due to
 lymphadenopathy, although not necessarily reflecting a true abnormality. 
 Correlation to prior chest radiographs is recommended.  If not available,
 chest CT may be obtained for further evaluation. 
 
 2.  Increased perihilar interstitial markings of unknown chronicity.  If
 acute, this may represent mild vascular congestion.  If chronic, this may
 represent airway inflammation.  Correlation with prior radiographs would be
 helpful.
