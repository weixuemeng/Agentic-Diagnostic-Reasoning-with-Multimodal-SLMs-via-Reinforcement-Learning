  1. Retrocardiac opacity persists. This may represent a sequestration or small
  fat-containing hernia.
  
  2. Oblique views uncovered a 1.4 cm nodule in the right mid lung.
  
  Both findings warrant additional evaluation with CT chest (preferrably with
  contrast).

                                 FINAL REPORT

 needed for further evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph performed ___ hours prior.
 
 RIGHT AND LEFT FRONTAL OBLIQUE VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The retrocardiac opacity
 persists on oblique views.  In addition, a 1.4 cm x 1.4 cm nodule is now seen
 in the right lung field.  Remainder of the lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity persists and could represent a small sequestration or

 basis.
