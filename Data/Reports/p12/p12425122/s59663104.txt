                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with subdural hemorrhage and left eye proptosis.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacer unit projects over the left chest with leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 unchanged.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal
 contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob with
 a mildly tortuous aorta.  The previously described pulmonary edema has
 resolved.  Pleuroparenchymal scarring, and possible pleural calcification, at
 the left base is longstanding, but there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine, primarily
 in the form of anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
