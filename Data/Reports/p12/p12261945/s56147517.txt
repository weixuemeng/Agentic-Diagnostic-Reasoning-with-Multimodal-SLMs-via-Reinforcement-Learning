                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right VATS with pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection.  Widened mediastinum is
 due to tortuosity of the vessels and enlarged thyroid gland.  Increasing
 opacity in the right lower lobe could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.  Right chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema is unchanged and mild.
