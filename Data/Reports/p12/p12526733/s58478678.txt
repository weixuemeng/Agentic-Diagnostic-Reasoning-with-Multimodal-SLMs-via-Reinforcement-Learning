                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC displacement, question still in
 SVC.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line has retracted and now has its tip seen over
 the expected location of the distal brachiocephalic vein; placement within the
 internal mammary vein cannot be entirely excluded without additional
 projections.  A wet reading was provided by Dr. ___ to ___ by
 phone on ___ at 9:57 p.m.  Lung volumes remain low and there are patchy
 bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  There are possibly also
 small effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac size and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in
 positioning and technique.  Patient's mandible obscures the apices.
