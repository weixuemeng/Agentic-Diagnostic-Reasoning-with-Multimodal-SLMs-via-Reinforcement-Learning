 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the nasogastric tube was pulled and
 replaced by a Dobbhoff catheter. However, this catheter is positioned in
 either the upper or of the lower esophagus but is not projecting over the
 stomach.  The tube needs to be either withdrawn or repositioned.  A later
 radiograph, performed at 23:38 confirms correct position of the device.  No
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The previous right internal jugular
 vein catheter was removed.
