                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ischemic bowel, intubated  // interval
 change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged, with the side port of the nasogastric tube again
 above the esophagogastric junction. Retrocardiac opacification with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe. Asymmetric opacification in the lungs could reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
