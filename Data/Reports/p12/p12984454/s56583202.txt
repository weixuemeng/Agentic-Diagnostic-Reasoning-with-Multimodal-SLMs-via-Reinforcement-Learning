                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There is
 no pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Left apical
 scarring is redemonstrated.  Intrathoracic aorta is markedly tortuous.  Heart
 size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in the
 right lung base likely represent plate-like atelectasis.  The imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
