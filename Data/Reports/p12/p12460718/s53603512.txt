                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis have partially
 improved, with residual left retrocardiac atelectasis and small-to-moderate
 effusion remaining.  Note is also made of improved aeration in the right lower
 lobe, with residual incompletely marginated opacity adjacent to the right
 hilum, possibly representing an area of loculated pleural fluid with adjacent
 right basilar atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema are
 also demonstrated.
