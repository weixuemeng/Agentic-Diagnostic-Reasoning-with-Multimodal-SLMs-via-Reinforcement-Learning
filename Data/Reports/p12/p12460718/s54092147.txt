                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of colectomy for Crohn's
 disease that presented for strangulated parastomal hernia with leukocytosis
 and lactic acidosis, now status post exploratory laparotomy, reexploration
 with open abdomen and multisystem organ dysfunction, post-bronchoscopy chest
 examination.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-erect
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained
 10 hours earlier during the same day.  The patient is moderately rotated to
 the right, similar as it occurred on the previous examination.  There is
 significant perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation suggestive of
 pulmonary congestion.  Basal densities seen bilaterally, most likely represent
 pleural effusions that partially layer in the posterior dependent compartment
 of the pleural spaces.  Permanent pacer unchanged in left anterior axillary
 position with two intracavitary electrodes in unchanged termination points in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  A right internal jugular approach
 sheath is still seen and continues to terminate in the upper mediastinum close
 to the expected junction with the subclavian vein.  The patient remains
 intubated with the ETT in unchanged position, some 6 cm above the level of the
 carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged stable chest findings with evidence of bilateral
 pleural effusion and pulmonary congestion, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
