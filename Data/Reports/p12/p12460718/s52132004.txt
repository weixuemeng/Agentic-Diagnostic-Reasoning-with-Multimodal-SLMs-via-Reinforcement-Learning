                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of colectomy for Crohn's disease.  Multiorgan
 dysfunction, evaluation for pleural fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral
 pleural effusions have decreased in extent.  Effusions are still present, but
 clearly more limited to the costophrenic sinuses than on the previous exam.
 
 The other elements of the image are unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly with minimal
 fluid overload, but no evidence of pneumonia.  Unchanged areas of bilateral
 basal atelectasis.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.
