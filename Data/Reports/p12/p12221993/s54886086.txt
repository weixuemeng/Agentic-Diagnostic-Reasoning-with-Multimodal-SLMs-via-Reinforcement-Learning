                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Down Syndrome, nonverbal, multilobar
 pneumonia, increased O2 requirement  // interval worsening of pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a multifocal pneumonia has overall
 progressed in the interval, with worsening areas of consolidation in both
 lower lobes.  Right upper lobe involvement is more difficult to assess due to
 partial obscuration by external overlying structures, but is probably not
 appreciably changed.
