                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with difficulty weaning off vent  // pulm edema
 vs. effusions      pulm edema vs. effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Again the nasogastric tube tip is in the lower esophagus with
 the side port at the level of the left mainstem bronchus.  Retrocardiac
 opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and small pleural effusion.  Hazy opacification at the right base
 appears improved, though in addition to improved effusion atelectasis this
 appearance could merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the
 patient.
