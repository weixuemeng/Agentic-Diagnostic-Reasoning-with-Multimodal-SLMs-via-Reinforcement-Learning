                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta, this likely is the cause of
 apparent widening of the mediastinum.  Lung volumes are within normal limits. 
 No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.  No pleural effusion seen.  Surgical
 hardware in the lower cervical spine is incompletely visualized.  Small
 sclerotic focus in the left proximal humerus likely reflects a bone island.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.  Apparent widening a mediastinum
 appears to be due to unfolding of the thoracic aorta, exaggerated by the AP
 technique.  Recommend PA and lateral chest radiographs when the patient's
 clinical condition improves.
