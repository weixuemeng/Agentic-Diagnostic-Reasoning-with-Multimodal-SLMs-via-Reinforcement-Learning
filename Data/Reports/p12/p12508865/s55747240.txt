                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post ORIF of right calcaneus
 fracture, now with fever spike.  Evaluate for pulmonary abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational
 effort and obscure major portion of heart silhouette and result in crowded
 appearance of pulmonary vasculature.  There is, however, no evidence of any
 pulmonary vascular congestion, acute infiltrate, or pneumothorax.  The lateral
 pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax is observed in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of significant cardiovascular or pulmonary
 abnormalities, no pleural effusion reaching lateral pleural sinuses.  Single
 view cannot exclude minor pleural effusions and depending posterior pleural
 sinuses.
