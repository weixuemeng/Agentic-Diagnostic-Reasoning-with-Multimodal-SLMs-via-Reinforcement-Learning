                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diffuse weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of underlying
 emphysema.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles on the posterior view
 may reflect tiny pleural effusions or pleural thickening.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  There is biapical pleural thickening
 and scarring.  No pulmonary edema is present.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs suggesting underlying emphysema.  Blunted
 costophrenic angles posteriorly may suggest tiny bilateral pleural effusions
 or pleural thickening.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
