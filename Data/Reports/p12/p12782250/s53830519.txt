                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain post trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimally displaced fractures of the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs are
 noted along with a small-moderate right apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 opacities are noted.  Otherwise, left hemithorax is normal. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Minimally displaced fractures of the posterior right fifth and sixth ribs
 with an associated small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Bibasilar opacities, most likely representative of atelectasis. However,
 continued followup is recommended.
