                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with right-sided pneumothorax for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Little change in comparison to prior study with displaced fractures
 of the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs with a stable small-to-moderate
 right apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities persist.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Little change in comparison to prior study with minimally displaced
 fractures of the posterior right fifth and sixth ribs and associated stable
 small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Bibasilar opacities persist and are most likely representative of
 atelectasis.
