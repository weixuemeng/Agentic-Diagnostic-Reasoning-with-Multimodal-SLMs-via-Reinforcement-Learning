 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study the endotracheal tube has been removed. Lung
 volumes are decreased when compared to the prior study consistent with removal
 of the ET tube.  There is patchy left lower lobe consolidation likely
 reflecting atelectasis, infection cannot be excluded.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the
 prior study.  No pneumothorax seen.  No definite pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe likely reflects residual a
 atelectasis given the decrease in lung volumes compared to the prior study.
