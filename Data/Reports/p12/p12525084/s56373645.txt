                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, on Coumadin.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is similar mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Hazy opacity projecting along the left lateral lung base appears increased
 with a new indistinct margin to the left lateral cardiac border suggesting a
 lingular opacity.  Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New suspected lingular opacity.  Differential considerations
 include pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.  Short-term followup
 radiographs, preferably with PA and lateral technique if possible, may be
 helpful to reassess.
