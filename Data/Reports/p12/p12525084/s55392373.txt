                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CXR concerning for pneumonia on admission,
 altered mental status // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is more significantly rotated leftward somewhat limiting
 evaluation. Lung volumes are lower. Left lower lung opacity is stable to
 minimally improved. Atelectasis at the right base is not significantly
 worsened. Heart size is likely top normal. The aortic arch is calcified.
 Evaluation of the mediastinal and hilar contours is limited by rotation though
 there is no gross abnormality. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable pulmonary edema. Allowing for significant leftward rotation of the
 patient left lower lobe opacity is stable to minimally improved possibly
 reflecting pleural effusion and/or atelectasis. However in the right clinical
 setting persistent pneumonia is not excluded. If clinically indicated a CT of
 the chest may be obtained.
