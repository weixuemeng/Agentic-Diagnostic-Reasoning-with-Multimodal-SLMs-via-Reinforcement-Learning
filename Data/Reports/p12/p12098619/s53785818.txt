                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is probably little
 change in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Prominence of the
 right paramediastinal region again suggests lymphadenopathy, as does the
 filling of the aortopulmonary window.  The right basilar opacification is not
 seen as prominently.
 
 CT again would be recommended to assess for extensive hilar and mediastinal
 adenopathy.
