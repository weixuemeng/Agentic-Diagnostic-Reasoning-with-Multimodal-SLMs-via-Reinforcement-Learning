 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Diffuse bilateral hazy opacities are
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  There are likely small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may represent changes due to
 atelectasis and CHF. No definite focal consolidations identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, moderate pulmonary edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions consistent with congestive heart failure.
