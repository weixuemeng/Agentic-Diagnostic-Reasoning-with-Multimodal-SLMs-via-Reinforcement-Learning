                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD.  New hypoxia.  Suspect edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes have improved and mediastinal venous caliber has decreased. 
 Heart size is normal.  Right basal lung lesion has a nodular configuration,
 and the contour of the mediastinum, particularly in the region of the
 aortopulmonic window suggests adenopathy.  These are indications for chest CT
 scanning, at which time the residual consolidation at the left lung base can
 be analyzed to see whether it looks more like pneumonia than edema.  Heart
 size is normal.  No pleural effusion is present.  Dr. ___ was paged.
