                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is left
 basilar opacity which partially obscures the left lateral heart border,
 potentially due to atelectasis although a developing infiltrate is also
 possible.  Elsewhere, lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lingular opacity partially silhouetting the heart border,
 potentially due to atelectasis however developing infiltrate is not excluded
 and clinical correlation is suggested.
