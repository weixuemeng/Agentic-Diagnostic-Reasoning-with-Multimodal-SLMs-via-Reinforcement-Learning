                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Post-intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  An
 endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.7 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing over the left lower
 hemithorax, with side port in the left mid hemithorax, concerning for in left
 lower lobe bronchus vs. potentially in a hiatal hernia, regardless, is in
 inappropriate position and should be withdrawn and repositioned.  There are
 diffuse right greater than left alveolar opacities, which may be due to
 extensive pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, contusion, or even infection
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  The right costophrenic angle is blunted
 and there may be an underlying pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal.  The aortic arch is calcified.  A battery pack is seen projecting
 over the left axilla with lead extending up into the neck, which may be a
 vagal nerve stimulator.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube in inappropriate position, terminating over the left
 lower hemithorax concerning for within the left lower lung, alternatively this
 could be within a hiatal hernia, although is above the level of the diaphragm
 and in inappropriate position.  Recommend withdrawal and repositioning.  This
 finding and recommendation was discussed with Dr. ___ in the ___
 Emergency Department at 2:10 p.m. on ___, three minutes after
 discovery.
 2.  Extensive, right greater than left pulmonary alveolar opacities, centered
 in the perihilar regions but also involving all lobes, could be due to
 asymmetric edema, pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion; in the appropriate clinical
 setting, underlying infection not excluded.
 3.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a pleural effusion.
