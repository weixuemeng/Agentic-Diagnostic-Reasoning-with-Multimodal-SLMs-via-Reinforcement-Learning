                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:56 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Replaced VNS, evaluate positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower today, reflected in vascular crowding and bibasilar
 atelectasis,  moderate on the right, more severe on the left.  Given the low
 lung volumes, mild interstitial edema would be difficult to detect.  There is
 no large pleural effusion but small volume of left pleural fluid might be
 present.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Moderate-sized hiatus hernia is noted.  Leftward deviation of the
 trachea in the neck, contralateral to the side of the new VNS lead, suggests
 enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid or other adjacent mass.  New or
 repositioned VNS device  in the left lateral chest wall gives rise to VNS
 device that runs subcutaneously to the left lateral neck where it coils.
