                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with seizure, intubated.  // eval for ett placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is leftward rotated limiting the evaluation. However, the ET tube
 is approximately 5 cm from the carina with the chin elevated. Enteric tube
 courses in the esophagus to the level of the left hemidiaphragm and then
 beyond the field of view. Lung volumes are low.  There is worsening
 atelectasis at the right base. The left costophrenic sulcus and the inferior
 tip of the right costophrenic sulcus are omitted from view.  Heart size is
 exaggerated by low lung volumes and likely normal.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube 5 cm from the carina with the chin elevated is in acceptable position.
