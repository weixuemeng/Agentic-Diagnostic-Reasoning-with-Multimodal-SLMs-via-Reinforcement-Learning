                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is an area of increased opacification
 projected just above the outer aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.  The apex of
 the hemidiaphragm appears somewhat laterally displaced.  This combination
 raises the possibility of subpulmonic pleural effusion with either atelectasis
 or, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia at the right
 base.
 
 Remainder of the study is essentially within normal limits.
