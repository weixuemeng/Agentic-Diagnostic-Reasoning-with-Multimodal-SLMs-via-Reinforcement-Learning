                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with lumbar spinal stenosis
 after two laminectomies and extensive abnormalities on musculoskeletal
 ultrasound; currently with acute onset of chest heaviness.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. Lungs are essentially
 clear and there is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Of note
 is the left perihilar opacity that was not well seen on the prior study and
 potentially might represent pulmonary nodule, 2.6 x 1 cm in diameter. 
 Correlation with chest CT is required.
