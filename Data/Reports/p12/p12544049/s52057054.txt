 A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  An enteric tube has been placed in the interim but the side port is
 above the GE junction and should be advanced by at least 10 cm to position it
 within the gastric body.  There is mild interstitial edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis, left greater than right is again noted.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions are noted.  There is no large pneumothorax.
