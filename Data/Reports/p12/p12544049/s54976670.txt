  1.  Low lying endotracheal tube with the tip situated 9 mm from the carina.
  
  2. Progression of pulmonary edema, now moderate with bibasilar opacities, left
  greater than right. Aspiration is not excluded.
  
  3. Enteric tube side port above the GE junction.  Recommend advancing by 10 cm
  of the tube is use for feeding.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with new intubation, evaluate for endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed at 13:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lying tip of the endotracheal tube is situated 9 mm from the carina.  The
 enteric tube side port is noted to be above the GE junction with the tip
 likely at the GE junction.  Tip of the right IJ is again seen at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Superimposed upon interstitial edema is worsening
 opacity in the left mid lung region.  Additionally, left pleural effusion has
 increased in size with adjacent worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lying endotracheal tube with the tip situated within 1 cm from the
 carina.
 
 2.  Worsening opacities in the left mid lung, possibly due to asymmetrical
 edema, although secondary process such as aspiration is also possible. 
 Increasing left effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  .
 
 3.  Enteric tube side port above the GE junction.  Recommend advancing by 10
 cm of the tube is use for feeding.
