                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with continued O2 requirement, s/p IVF boluses 
 // Assess for pulmonary edema      Assess for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the dense opacification in the left
 mid-zone has an appearance more suggestive of dense atelectasis or loculated
 fluid.  Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and pleural fluid.  Less prominent effusion and atelectasis is
 seen at the right base.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with probably little overall
 change in the degree of vascular congestion.
