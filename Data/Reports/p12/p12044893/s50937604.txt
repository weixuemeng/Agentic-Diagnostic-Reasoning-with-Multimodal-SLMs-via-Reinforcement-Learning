 HISTORY:  Left thoracic pain.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Apart from minimal atelectasis in the right lung base, the lungs are clear. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  No acute displaced fractures are demonstrated.

 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  No displaced fractures are seen.  If there
 is continued concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
