                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new fever  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than right.  There
 are small areas of increased lucency within these constellation, raising
 concern for item cavitation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.  A radiopaque
 TIPS catheter projects over the right upper quadrant.  A nasogastric tube
 enters the distal stomach, tip not visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bibasilar airspace opacities with possible cavitation are compatible with
 multifocal, potentially necrotizing pneumonia.  A chest CT may be done for
 further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 2:37 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
