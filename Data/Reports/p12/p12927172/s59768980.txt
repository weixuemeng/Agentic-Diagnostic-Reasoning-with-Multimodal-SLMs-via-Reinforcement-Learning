                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis and known pleural effusion, now
 s/p paracentesis  // Is the Left pleural effusion smaller?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, moderate left pleural effusion
 has decreased in size and a small right pleural effusion has nearly resolved,
 adjacent bibasilar atelectasis has also improved.  Decreased distension of
 upper abdomen likely relates to reduction in volume of ascites following
 paracentesis procedure.
