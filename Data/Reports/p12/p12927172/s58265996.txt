 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are bibasilar
 opacifications with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with
 areas of atelectasis and pleural fluid that is more prominent on the left.  No
 evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  However, this is not an upright view.  If there
 is serious clinical concern for free intraperitoneal gas, a true upright view
 should be obtained or the patient taken for CT examination.
