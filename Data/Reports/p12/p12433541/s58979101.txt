                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma with strep
 bacteremia and epidural abscess.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  The exam is compared to the previous chest x-rays of ___ and
 ___ and the CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 It is difficult to compare this exam with the previous one on ___ because
 of the rotation of the patient in the last exam.  In comparison to the one on
 ___, the right hilar region is more dense and more convex mostly in its
 lower region.  There is also underlying post-radiation changes with volume
 loss.  Small right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumonia. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The left lung is unremarkable.  The mediastinal and
 cardiac contour is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  The right hilar region appears more dense and more convex which is
 worrisome for progression of the malignancy.  A CT scan is suggested.
