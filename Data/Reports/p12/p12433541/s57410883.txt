  There is a new large right loculated pleural effusion with middle and lower
  lobe collapse.  The patient is rotated, giving the impression of rightward
  tracheal deviation, however there is likely no shift of midline mediastinal
  structures.  Given the patient's history of lung cancer originating near the
  right hilum, this may represent bronchial obstruction and malignant effusion.
