                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax after
 pigtail catheter placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right pigtail catheter is in place.  The current study reveals no
 appreciable pneumothorax.  The right central venous line catheter tip is at
 the level of cavoatrial junction.  Left lower lobe consolidation appears to be
 slightly progressed as well as slight increase in left pleural effusion is
 demonstrated, although it might represent positional changes.  Attention to
 this area on the subsequent radiograph is required.
