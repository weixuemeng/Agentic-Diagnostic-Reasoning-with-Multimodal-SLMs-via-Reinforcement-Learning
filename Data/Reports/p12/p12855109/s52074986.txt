 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present, the tip lies in the region of the SVC/RA
 junction, based on the lateral view.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly eventrated.  Left
 hemidiaphragm is lateralized.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.    There is no CHF.  There
 is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No consolidation or effusion is identified.
 On the current film, there is a relatively kyphotic configuration to the
 thoracolumbar junction, ? positional.
