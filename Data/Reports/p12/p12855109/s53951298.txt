                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right pneumothorax, post-chest tube
 placement; assess for residual pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph is compared to
 that dated ___, 12:12 p.m. and CT dated ___. Interval placement of
 right pigtail chest tube with the retention pigtail loop projecting over the
 right upper thorax.  Multiple sideholes on the catheter are projecting over
 the right lateral thorax.  Residual right pneumothorax is tiny, much smaller
 than that on the prior radiograph. Small left pleural effusion is stable. 
 Mediastinum is more midline as compared to that on the previous radiograph. 
 Prominence of hila may be related to pulmonary vascular congestion, given the
 lack of lymphadenopathy on recent CT.  Mild right basal atelectasis. 
 Unchanged right subclavian catheter, with its tip projecting over the expected
 location of lower SVC.  Mild S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine. 
 Small amount of subcutaneous gas overlying the right lower thorax/chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates tiny residual right apical
 pneumothorax.  Right chest tube in place with its retention pigtail loop
 projecting over the upper thorax.  Mediastinum is more midline than that on
 the prior study.
