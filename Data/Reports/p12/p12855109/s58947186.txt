                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:32 A.M. ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever, suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 A region of recurrent opacification at the left lung base associated with a
 small left pleural effusion has reappeared since early on ___.  I doubt
 that this is pneumonia, and I see no lung abnormality particularly suspicious
 for infection.  Heart is mildly enlarged, but there is no pulmonary vascular
 or mediastinal venous engorgement.  Right pleural effusion is small if any. 
 Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No residual pneumothorax.
