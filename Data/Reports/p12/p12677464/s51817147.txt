 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with L subscapular pain, ? PNA  // ? acute
 cardiopulm process, ,PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There relatively low lung volumes.  Prominence of the interstitial markings
 bilaterally suggests interstitial edema.Persistent medial left base
 retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view may be due to tortuous aorta or
 hiatal hernia.  Streaky basilar opacity on the lateral view may represent
 atelectasis although infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky basilar opacity on the lateral view may represent atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild interstitial
 edema.
