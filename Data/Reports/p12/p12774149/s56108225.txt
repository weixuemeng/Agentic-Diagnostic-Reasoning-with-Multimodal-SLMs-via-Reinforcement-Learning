                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Increased anterior posterior
 diameter of the chest cage is suggestive of COPD. Increased opacities at the
 lung bases bilaterally could reflect atelectasis with a probable component of
 bronchiectasis, however an early infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis with a possible
 component of bronchiectasis.  An early infectious process, however cannot be
 entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  
 
 2. Increased anterior posterior diameter of the chest cage is suggestive of
 COPD.
