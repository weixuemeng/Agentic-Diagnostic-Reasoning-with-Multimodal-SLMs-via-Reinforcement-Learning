 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMH significant for dCHF (EF ___%, requiring multiple
 intubations in past), ESRD on HD, HTN, T2DM, AFib on warfarin and CAD who was
 transferred from ___ s/p intubation for presumed CHF exacerbation
 and further management.  // status of Pulm edema/Pulm effusions   status of
 Pulm edema/Pulm effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to previous study dated ___ at 07:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 07:50 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. The right internal
 jugular central line remains in place unchanged. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged despite patient rotation on the
 current study. There are stable patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left costophrenic
 angle is not entirely included but there is likely a layering left effusion. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
