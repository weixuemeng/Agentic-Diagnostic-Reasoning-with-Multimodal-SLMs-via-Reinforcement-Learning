 HISTORY:  Swan-___ catheter.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the Swan-___ catheter has been
 pulled back so that the tip lies within the mediastinum portion of the right
 pulmonary artery.  The pulmonary edema has improved and the cardiac size has
 decreased.  Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume loss in
 the lower lobe.
