                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myocarditis, confirm nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below diaphragm and
 the tip is not identified on the current study.  The endotracheal tube and
 right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are stable in position.  There
 continue to be moderate-sized layering pleural effusions with associated
 bibasilar airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Calcification of the aortic
 knob consistent with atherosclerosis.  No pneumothorax is seen, although a
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in patient's positioning between studies.
