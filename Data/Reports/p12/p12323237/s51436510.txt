                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 845 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with giant cell arteritis, agitated and
 self-extubated, evaluate position of Swan-Ganz catheter.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 742.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 846 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are no longer present.  The
 right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the
 right pulmonary artery.  Improved aeration although persistent layering
 bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacity likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  The pulmonary vasculature now appears
 somewhat more ill defined and full suggesting a component of overlying
 perihilar edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 remains unfolded and tortuous.  The stomach is distended with air.
