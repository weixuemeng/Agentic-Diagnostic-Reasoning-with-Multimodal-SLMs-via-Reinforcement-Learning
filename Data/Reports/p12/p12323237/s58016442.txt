                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pancreatic cancer on chemotherapy presents with
 myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.  Please evaluate for interval change and
 placement of lines.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette continues to be mildly enlarged with improving mild
 pulmonary edema since the last radiograph.  An ascending Swan-Ganz catheter is
 unchanged with the tip overlying the region of the tricuspid valve.  The
 intra-aortic balloon pump is in the descending aorta approximately at the
 level of the superior margin of the left main bronchus.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.  IABP ends just above the level
 of the left main bronchus, and the Swan-ganz catheter overlies the region of
 the tricuspid valve.
