                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 742 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myocarditis, off ECMO, now intubated.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 742 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination.  The lung
 volumes are diminished.  There continue to be layering bilateral effusions
 with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 endotracheal tube and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are likely in
 unchanged position.  There are external pacing wires overlying the patient.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  However, the stomach is now distended with air.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the current study.
