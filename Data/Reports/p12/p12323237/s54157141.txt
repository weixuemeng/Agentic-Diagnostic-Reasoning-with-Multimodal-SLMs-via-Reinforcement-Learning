                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 19:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myocarditis, check placement of the
 orogastric tube and PA line.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 9:39.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 19:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip
 approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  The right Swan-Ganz catheter now has
 its tip in the right pulmonary artery.  Nasogastric tube is not visualized. 
 Stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 Moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions with relatively diminished lung
 volumes associated with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity of
 detecting pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
