 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of
 mild pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal atelectasis at both lung
 bases.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours, with the exception of a
 slightly prominent right upper mediastinum, potentially caused by a
 retrosternal goiter.  Evaluation with ultrasound could be performed.
