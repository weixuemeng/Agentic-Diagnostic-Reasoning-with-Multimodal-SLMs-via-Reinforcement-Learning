 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperinflation of
 the lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary

 congestion, or pleural effusion.
 The soft tissue prominence of the breast is much less on the right, raising
 the possibility of prior partial mastectomy.
