                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath today
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are demonstrated at the aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Bilateral shoulder arthroplasties are partially
 imaged. There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left basilar subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.
