                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rising WBC count  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___ at 09:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning, with low inspiratory volumes.  The  lower lateral left
 hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the film.
 
 Compared to the prior study, the right IJ central line has been removed. 
 Again seen is a dual lead pacemaker type device, with 1 lead tip over the
 right atrium.  The second lead does not appear changed, but the distal tip is
 excluded from the film.
 
 Allowing for considerable differences in positioning, no definite change is
 identified.  As noted, the lateral half of the left hemidiaphragm and left
 costophrenic angle are excluded from the film.
 
 Upper zone redistribution is noted, but doubt overt CHF.  No focal
 consolidations seen in the visualized portion of the lung.  Minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle, without gross right effusion.
 
 Incidental note made of findings consistent with a chronic left shoulder
 rotator cuff tear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower left chest excluded from film.  Allowing for this, doubt significant
 interval change.
 
 If clinically indicated, a repeat AP view to include the lower left chest
 lateral could be obtained at no additional charge to the patient.
