                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous, unchanged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable. The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are minimally worse compared to
 the prior exam, and likely reflect areas of atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. Scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine with
 multilevel degenerative changes are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities, slightly worse in the interval, could reflect
 areas of atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded.
