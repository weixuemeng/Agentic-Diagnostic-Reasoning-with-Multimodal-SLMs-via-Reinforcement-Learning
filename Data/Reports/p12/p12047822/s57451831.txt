                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 appear similar.  Patchy and linear opacities at the lung bases have worsened,
 particularly on the left.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. 
 Bones are diffusely demineralized, consistent with the patient's advanced age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are probably due
 to atelectasis, but aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia are also
 possible.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
