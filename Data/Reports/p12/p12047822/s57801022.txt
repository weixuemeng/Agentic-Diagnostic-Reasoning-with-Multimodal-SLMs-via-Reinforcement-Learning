 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, productive cough and dyspnea, here
 to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated suggesting background COPD.  No
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  The

 enlarged but stable with a left ventricular configuration.  The aortic knob is
 partially calcified, with a markedly tortuous and unfolded thoracic aorta. 
 Calcification of the central tracheobronchial tree is also noted.  Scoliosis
 and degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen with probable loss of
 vertebral height, but no compression fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
