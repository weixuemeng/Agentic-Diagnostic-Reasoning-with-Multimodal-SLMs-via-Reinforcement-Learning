                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with stomach mass, intraperitoneal blood, hypoxia 
 // eval ? edema, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle suggests a trace left pleural effusion with associated left basilar
 atelectasis.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  No pneumothorax.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis with probable trace left
 pleural effusion.
 2. No pulmonary edema.
