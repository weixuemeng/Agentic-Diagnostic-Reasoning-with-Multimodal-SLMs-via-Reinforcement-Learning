 INDICATION:  Anterolisthesis, dementia, evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive bilateral apical scarring, associated with symmetrical
 pleural thickening.  Elevation of the hilar structures on both sides.  The
 changes are likely post-infectious in origin.  The remaining lung is
 hyperinflated and shows a loss of structure.  Moderate cardiomegaly without
 evidence of acute changes such as pulmonary edema or recent pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.  Small calcified granulomas in both upper lobes.
