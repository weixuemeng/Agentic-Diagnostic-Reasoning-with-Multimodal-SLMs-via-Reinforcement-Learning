                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ -year-old man with right rib pain after a fall, evaluate for
 rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  Subtle opacity near the right cardiophrenic angle is favored to
 represent crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.  There is no focal
 lung consolidation.  There is no pulmonary venous congestion or pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of
 a displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.  Note, chest radiography is not
 sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced fractures.  Dedicated
 rib detailed views could be obtained if this is of clinical concern.
 2. Clear lungs without focal consolidation.
