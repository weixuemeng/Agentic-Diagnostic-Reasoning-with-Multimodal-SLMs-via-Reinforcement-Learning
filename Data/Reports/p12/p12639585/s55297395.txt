  NG tube terminates below the diaphragm to the right of midline. Right PICC has
  been withdrawn, now terminating in the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low, but no
  acute cardiopulmonary process is identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film, an NG tube has been placed.  The tip extends
 beneath the diaphragm, overlying the distal gastric body.  The right
 subclavian PICC line tip now overlies the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 There is rotated positioning with low inspiratory volumes.  There are
 prominent vascular markings as well as atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 While these may be accentuated by low lung volumes, the possibility of some
 background vascular plethora or left base collapse and/or consolidation would
 be difficult to exclude.
