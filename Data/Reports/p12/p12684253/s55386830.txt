                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest tube in place and open wound. 
 Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, including
 most recent from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a small residual
 pneumothorax, present at the right lung apex, as well as at the right lung
 base, with a right-sided chest tube, directed towards the apex in a similar
 position compared to the prior studies.  The degree of subcutaneous emphysema
 along the right lateral chest wall and abdominal wall as well as the left
 lateral chest wall has improved since the prior study.
 
 The overall lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study, with mild
 atelectasis bilaterally, with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 There is no evidence of tension or mediastinal shift, and the heart size is
 stable.  A prosthetic mitral ring is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small residual right apical and basal pneumothorax, with chest
 tube in place.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.
