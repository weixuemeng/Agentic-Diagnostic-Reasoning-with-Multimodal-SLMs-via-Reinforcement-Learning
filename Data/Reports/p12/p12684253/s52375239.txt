                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place with persistent very small right
 apical pneumothorax.  Configuration of right basilar hydropneumothorax
 component is slightly different, with apparent slight increase in amount of
 pleural fluid and probably decreased in extent of pleural gas in this region. 
 On the left, there is a questionable increase in size of a small-to-moderate
 left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no relevant short interval change since the
 recent study.
