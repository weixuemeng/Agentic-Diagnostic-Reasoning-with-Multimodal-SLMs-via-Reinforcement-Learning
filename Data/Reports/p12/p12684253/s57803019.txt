  Somewhat difficult evaluation due to extensive subcutaneous air and skin
  folds. There is at least a small pneumothorax with apical and basilar
  components, but a more substantial pneumothorax might be present. A repeat
  xray in radiology may be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Subcutaneous air.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium have
 markedly progressed.  Small right pneumothorax has increased.  Small bilateral
 effusions have minimally improved.  Adjacent bibasilar opacities have
 improved.  Vascular congestion has improved.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There
 are lower lung volumes.
