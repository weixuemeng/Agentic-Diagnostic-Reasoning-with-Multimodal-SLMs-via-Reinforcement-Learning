                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with CMV pneumonitis, CHF, volume overload,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ central line unchanged in position.  Since the
 most recent radiograph, there is no significant change.  Again seen are
 bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities, more confluent in the right mid and
 lower lung zones which likely represent pulmonary edema; however, infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Again seen is a stable small left pleural
 effusion with some linear compressive atelectasis at the left base.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change.  Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities
 likely pulmonary edema; however, infectious process cannot be excluded.  Small
 left pleural effusion.
