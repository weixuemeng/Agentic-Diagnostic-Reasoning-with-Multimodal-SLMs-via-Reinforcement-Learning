 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, pneumonia, assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Extensive bilateral generalized right and basal left and perihilar
 opacities.  The opacities have constant severity and distribution.  No
 opacities have newly appeared.  There is unchanged evidence of moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus persists, so that a
 small pleural effusion in this location cannot be excluded.  The course of the
 right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.
