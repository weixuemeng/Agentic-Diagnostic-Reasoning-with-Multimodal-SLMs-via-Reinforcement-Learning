 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 559 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  A right subclavian PICC line is in place with
 its tip in the mid SVC.  Lungs appear relatively well inflated with some
 streaky bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis, although
 aspiration should also be considered.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged given differences in positioning and technique.
