                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with volume overload and respiratory
 distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 11:10 a.m.
 
 There is a right central venous catheter with distal lead tip in distal SVC. 
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  There are again seen diffuse airspace
 densities and more confluent areas of opacity within the left lobe.  These may
 represent pulmonary edema; however, superimposed infection is not entirely
 excluded.  A small left-sided pleural effusion is also seen.
