                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema present on ___ has nearly resolved.  There is residual
 interstitial abnormality providing prominent cuffing of right perihilar
 bronchi.  These highlighted bronchi in the right lung are larger than
 expected.  Bronchiectasis is sometimes an accompaniment of bronchiolitis
 obliterans, which can be seen with graft-versus-host disease, or it may be the
 residual of infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably
 unchanged.  The heart is top normal size, stable.  Right internal jugular line
 tip projects over the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
