                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.  Question progression of right-sided
 opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffusely throughout the right lung are patchy opacities which
 correspond to those seen on CT.  Cardiac silhouette is moderate in size, seems
 to be slightly larger than the earlier study and this could be simply from
 projection.  At the left lung base, there also do appear to be some increasing
 opacities which were not seen on the CT, but could be simply atelectasis.  A
 central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.
