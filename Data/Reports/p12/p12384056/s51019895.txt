                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CMV pneumonia, now with increase in
 labored breathing.  Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 7:39 a.m.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film, ___ at 11:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC,
 unchanged.  When compared to the most recent prior study, there has been
 slight interval improvement in the bilateral airspace process suggestive of
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  However, there is still a substantial
 residual pulmonary edema present on the current examination.  Overall, cardiac
 and contours are likely unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
