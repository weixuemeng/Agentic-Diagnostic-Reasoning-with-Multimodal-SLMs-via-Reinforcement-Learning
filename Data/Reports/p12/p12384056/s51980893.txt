                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with acute myelocytic leukemia, no
 blood return from Port-A-Cath line despite TPA treatment.  Is Port-A-Cath
 intact and in right position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  The chest findings are grossly
 within normal limits and stable since the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  The left-sided Port-A-Cath system is identified, demonstrating
 a vascular entrance at the internal jugular vein level.  The line traverses
 over to the right side and terminates in a rather horizontal position
 apparently abutting the lateral wall of the SVC at a height level 2 cm above
 the carina.  When comparison is made with the next preceding chest
 examination, the line terminated in a more normal position pointing downwards
 overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at the level of the carina
 and thus indicating its position in the mid portion of the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax has developed or any other new abnormality is seen.  The apparent
 changes in line position indicates a migration of the line in superior
 direction approximately 4 cm higher up.  The terminal small bent of the
 catheter indicates that it may be pressed against the lateral wall of the
 superior vena cava.  Otherwise, the line is unchanged and no interruption is
 seen.  Page was placed at ___ at 3:50 p.m.  Telephone contact with
 responsible nurse ___, ___ was established.  Recommendation
 was made to withdraw carefully the line under fluoroscopic control.
