  Lungs are low in volume with right IJ catheter in the superior cavoatrial
  junction. Interstitial pulmonary opacities are markedly improved from earlier
  this month with right basal reticulonodular  opacities better seen on
  accompanying chest CT and reflective of mild recurrent or residual disease

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with transplant and chills.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided central venous catheter with distal lead tip
 at the right atrium.  This could be pulled back slightly for more optimal
 placement.  There is some improvement of the interstitial prominence since the
 prior study.  There is no focal consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinum is within normal limits.
