                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with AML, status post allo-transplant and CMV
 pneumonitis.  Assess for interval change, question bronchiectasis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from ___, PA and lateral chest
 radiographs from ___, and multiple priors.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. 
 Interstitial opacities, worse in the right lung, are stable.  Increased
 haziness may suggest small layering pleural effusions bilaterally. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Right IJ central catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial opacities, worse on the right, are unchanged. 
 Increased haziness suggests the possibility of small layering pleural
 effusions.
