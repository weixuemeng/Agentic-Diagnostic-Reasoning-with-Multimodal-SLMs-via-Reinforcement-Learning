  Compared with examination from 8 hours prior, there appears to be slightly
  more confluent patchy bilateral opacities,, particularly on the left, possibly
  suggesting mildly progressed edema.  There is persistent left pleural
  effusion.  Otherwise no significant change.  Right-sided PICC remains in
  stable position.
