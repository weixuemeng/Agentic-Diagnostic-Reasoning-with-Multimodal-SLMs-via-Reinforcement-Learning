                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest congestion  // interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has
 substantially improved, and a left retrocardiac opacification has partially
 cleared.  Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size.  A 2 cm oval
 shaped opacity in the right mid lung adjacent to surgical chain sutures could
 potentially represent loculated fluid in the fissure based on prior CT of ___, but should be further evaluated by dedicated PA and lateral
 chest radiographs when the patient's condition permits to help exclude a
 pulmonary nodule.
