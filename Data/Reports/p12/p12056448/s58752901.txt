 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer leads are in the standard
 position, in the right atrium, right ventricle and through the coronary sinus.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Diffuse interstitial reticular abnormality with subpleural and right lung
 predominance is grossly unchanged from prior study in keeping with patient's
 known pulmonary fibrosis.
