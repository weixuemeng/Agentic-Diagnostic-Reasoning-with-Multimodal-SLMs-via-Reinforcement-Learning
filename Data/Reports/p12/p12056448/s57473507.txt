                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with weakness, dyspnea on exertion. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary abnormalities or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Again mild cardiac enlargement is present. 
 The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated and shows calcium
 deposits in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  A permanent pacer is
 again noticed in left anterior axillary position connected to dual
 intracavitary electrodes, one of which is an ICD device.  Termination points
 of electrodes are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates features
 of mild-to-moderate degree of chronic congestion with upper zone
 redistribution, perivascular haze and some increased interstitial markings
 mostly on the bases.  New discrete parenchymal abnormalities cannot be
 identified and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any
 significant fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax has developed in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax also remain unchanged.  Comparison is
 extended to a chest examination of ___ at which time the patient was
 somewhat more congested.  Review was also undertaken of the chest CT ___ ___ which confirmed the described chronic pulmonary changes but excluded
 any local abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement stable, unchanged position
 of permanent pacer and ICD device, mild degree of chronic pulmonary congestion
 but absence of new acute infiltrates or significant pleural effusion.
