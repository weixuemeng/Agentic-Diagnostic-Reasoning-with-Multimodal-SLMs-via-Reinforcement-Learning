                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with EtOH hepatitis and cirrhosis now
 w/increased SOB.  // Is there worsening pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___:34
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Again seen is a right-sided PICC line.  Its position is unchanged over several
 films, overlying the right atrium, distal to the cavoatrial junction.  The
 previously seen Dobhoff type tube is no longer visualized.  A TIPS stent is
 faintly seen in the right upper quadrant.  Additional embolization material in
 other small densities are noted in the upper abdomen.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 
 Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Hazy
 density in the left lung could reflect a layering pleural effusion.  Again
 seen is retrocardiac opacity obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is vascular
 plethora and mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  This may be
 accentuated by slightly low volumes.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. PICC line tip distal to the cavoatrial junction, overlying the right
 atrium, but unchanged.  Clinical correlation requested regarding positioning.
 2. Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes are slightly low and
 the possibility of subtle interval increase in CHF findings cannot be
 excluded.
 3. Layering left pleural effusion with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation is also similar to the prior film.
 4. Interval removal of Dobhoff tube .
