                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Upper GI bleed status post intubation.  Evaluate ET tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube has been placed and appears slightly deviated to the
 right, however, the clinical team confirms an endotracheal location.  The tip
 is located 2 cm above the carina.
 
 There is a non layering, large left pleural effusion.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is likely a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Given the
 diffuse parenchymal abnormality, evaluation of the left hilus and mediastinum
 is limited.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
