 interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion has probably not improved.  No pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal shift to the right compromises the right Lung where basal
 consolidation is probably atelectasis.  Heart is top-normal size, exaggerated
 by very low lung volumes.  Vascular congestion in the right lung and
 mediastinum suggests volume overload and/or elevated central venous pressure.
