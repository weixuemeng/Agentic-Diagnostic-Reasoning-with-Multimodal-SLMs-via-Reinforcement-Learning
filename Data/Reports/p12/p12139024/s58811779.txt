                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETOH cirrhosis p/w UGIB s/p TIPS. Pt
 remains intubated  // Evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right pleural effusion may be slightly
 smaller.  Left pleural effusion is also likely smaller.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  There is CHF, with pulmonary edema.  Increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation is again seen.
 
 Tubular structure in right upper quadrant likely represents a tips stent. 
 Additional clips or other radiopaque structures overlie the upper mid abdomen.
 
 At the edge of these films, an old right humeral surgical neck fracture is
 seen, probably only partially united.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.  Persistent cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary edema, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
