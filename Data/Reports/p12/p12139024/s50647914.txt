 for bleeding only if the patient had an attempted central line placement on
 that side.  Therefore clinical correlation is essential.
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  On the right pulmonary vascular congestion and
 small right pleural effusion have worsened slightly.
 
 Mediastinal veins are greatly distended, due to volume overload or redirected
 portal venous flow.  No pneumothorax.
