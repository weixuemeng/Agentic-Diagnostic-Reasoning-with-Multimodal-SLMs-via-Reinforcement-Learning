                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, and CTA chest, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are continued interstitial opacities
 within a peripheral and basilar distribution compatible with underlying
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  Overall, the appearances are similar when
 compared to the prior study.  No definite new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged with fullness of the right upper mediastinal contour and right
 hilum compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy. Prominence of both hila is
 compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy and
 findings compatible with underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  No new
 focal consolidation is visualized.
