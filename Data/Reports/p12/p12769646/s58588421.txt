                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of crackles on right.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist,  patient was unable to get arms up for lateral views. 
 There is evidence of a large hiatal hernia and retrocardiac lucencies seen and
 opacity is seen, with adjacent left base atelectasis.  Overall, lung volumes
 are low.  There is patchy right base opacity which could be due to infection
 or aspiration.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may relate to hiatal hernia
 though underlying consolidation at this location is not excluded.  Very trace
 pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild prominence of interstitial marking may relate to chronic pulmonary
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis.
 2.  Patchy right base opacity is concerning for infection and/or aspiration. 
 Recommend followup to resolution.  
 3.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may relate to hiatal hernia, although
 additional site of consolidation is not excluded.  
 4.  Difficult to exclude small bilateral pleural effusions.
