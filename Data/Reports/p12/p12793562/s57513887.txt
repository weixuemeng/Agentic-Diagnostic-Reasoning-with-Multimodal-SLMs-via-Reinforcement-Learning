 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which leads to some bronchovascular crowding at the
 bases.  No focal opacity is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
