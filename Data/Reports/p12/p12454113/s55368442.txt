                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with a small pneumothorax following pleural catheter
 placement.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:   chest radiographs of the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal upright view of the chest demonstrates a small right apical
 pneumothorax, which is not significantly changed since study obtained one hour
 prior.  Right pleural catheter is in place with the tip projecting to the
 right of the T12 vertebral body.  The patient's known right upper lung mass is
 again noted.  Diffuse right lung opacities are also unchanged.  Left lung
 remains essentially clear.  There is no left pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to study obtained one hour prior, there is no significant
 interval change in small right apical pneumothorax.
