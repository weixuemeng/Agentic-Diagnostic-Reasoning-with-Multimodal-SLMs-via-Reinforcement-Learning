                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with right pleural effusion status post PleurX catheter
 placement.  Assess for position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ and CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of the
 right pleural catheter, tip projecting over right lower medial lung.  There is
 interval improvement of the right-sided pleural effusion.  A trace right
 apical pneumothorax is new since prior.  The patient's known right upper lung
 consolidation and diffuse right lung opacities are unchanged.  Left lung is
 essentially clear.  No left pleural effusion is appreciated.  There is no left
 pneumothorax.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The heart
 size is normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to the study obtained three hours prior, there is interval right
 pleural catheter placement with marked interval decrease in the right pleural
 effusion, which is now small.  Trace right pneumothorax is new since prior.
 
 Findings reported on critical results dashboard on ___.
