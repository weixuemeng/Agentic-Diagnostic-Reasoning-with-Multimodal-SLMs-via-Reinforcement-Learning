                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Substantial right upper and right lower lobe
 consolidation is present as well as asymmetrically distributed diffuse
 interstitial abnormality, more pronounced on the right.  Heart is normal in
 size. Right mediastinal and hilar contours are difficult to assess due to
 adjacent consolidation. Tracheoesophageal stripe is thickened on the lateral
 radiograph. Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right upper and lower lobe consolidation with asymmetrical
 interstitial thickening could reflect widespread pneumonia or aspiration with
 coexisting edema, but lung adenocarcinoma could produce a similar radiographic
 appearance. 
 
 If infectious symptoms are present, consider short term follow up CXR after
 antibiotic therapy. In the absence of infectious symptoms, consider CT for
 further characterization, if warranted clinically.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at ___ on
