                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:44 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD and metastatic lung cancer with
 increasing tachypnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 8:53 a.m.:
 
 No pneumothorax or change in small to moderate right pleural effusion.  I
 believe a drainage catheter still in place at the base of the right
 hemithorax.  Extent of opacification in the right lung has improved since ___ when there was severe atelectasis and then edema.  There is no residual
 pneumothorax.  A large right suprahilar mass, and smaller right lung nodules
 are still present.  Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, perhaps by distention of
 subdiaphragmatic GI tract.  Heart is top normal size.
