                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 The large right pleural effusion, and large mass-like region of consolidation
 in the right upper lobe have worsened over the past two weeks.  Central
 portion of the right perihilar lesion could be mass.  More peripherally,
 because of the interval change, it is most likely infectious.
 
 The left lung is clear and the heart size is normal.
 
 Overall, findings suggest central bronchogenic carcinoma until proved
 otherwise.  This could also be due to progressive infection, bronchoscopy is
 strongly recommended.
