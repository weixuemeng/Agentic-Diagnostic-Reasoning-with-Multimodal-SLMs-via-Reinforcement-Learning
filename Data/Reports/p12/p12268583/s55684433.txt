                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal.  Mild widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely related to low lung volumes.  No pulmonary
 vascular engorgement is seen, though there is mild crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous structures are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuates the superior mediastinal width and slightly
 limits assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma.  No gross radiographic evidence
 for pneumonia.
