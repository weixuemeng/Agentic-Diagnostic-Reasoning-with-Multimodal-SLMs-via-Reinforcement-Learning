                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache, hyponatremia and brain mass.

 FRONTAL LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST (3 EXPOSURES):  Midline sternotomy wires,
 mediastinal clips and a coronary artery stent/calcification are noted.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Streaky opacities at
 the bases consistent with atelectasis.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.
