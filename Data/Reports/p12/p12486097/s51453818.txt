                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged. Aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcifications. Left hilar contour is prominent. Diffuse
 interstitial abnormality is noted bilaterally with patchy more focal opacity
 noted in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 Multiple clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease. Patchy opacity in
 the left lung base may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.  Left hilar prominence could suggest enlargement
 of the pulmonary artery.
 
 Correlation with any prior imaging is recommended, and a dedicated
 high-resolution chest CT can be obtained for further assessment if not done
 previously.
