                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper quadrant pain, splenic laceration, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes.  Right base opacity may
 represent combination of atelectasis with underlying consolidation,
 particularly medially.  Somewhat rounded retrocardiac opacity with subtle
 lucency is consistent with patient's known hiatal hernia.  Adjacent
 atelectasis may be present.  There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle and a small pleural effusion is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal.  The aorta is calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no
 evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting or trace
 left pleural effusion.
 3.  Known hiatal hernia.
