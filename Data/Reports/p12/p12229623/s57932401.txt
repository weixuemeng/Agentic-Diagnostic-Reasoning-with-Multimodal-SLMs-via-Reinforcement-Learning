                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain, question pneumonia versus
 dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest:  The lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Tortuous aorta with aortic
 knob calcification is identified.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. An air-fluid level on the lateral film is compatible with a hiatal
 hernia. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
