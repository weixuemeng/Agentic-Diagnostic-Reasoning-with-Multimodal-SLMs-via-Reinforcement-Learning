 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, CKD  // weight loss
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is volume loss in the right lung with predominantly right upper lobe
 reticular opacities, this displaces the right hilum superiorly.  Appearances
 are consistent with post radiotherapy change as seen on the prior CT.  The
 right hilum is enlarged, again similar in appearance to the prior CT streaky
 left lower lobe opacities may reflect acute airways inflammation.  No
 additional pulmonary opacities are seen.  No pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe fibrosis and enlargement of the right hilum appears grossly
 stable when compared to the prior CT.
 
 Left lower lobe streaky opacities may reflect airways infection or
 inflammation.
