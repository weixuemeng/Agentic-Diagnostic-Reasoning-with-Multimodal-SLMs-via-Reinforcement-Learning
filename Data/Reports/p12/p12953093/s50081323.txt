                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer, COPD, on home O2, presents
 from rehab with SOB + cough + inc sputum production  // ?pneumonia vs. COPD
 exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Posterior left lower lobe
 nodule opacity correspond the patient's known pulmonary malignancy. Multiple
 smaller or pulmonary nodules bilaterally, better assessed on CT.  Since the
 prior study, there has been development of large right lower lung field,
 possibly right middle lobe consolidation, worrisome for pneumonia.  Left base
 and right perihilar opacities are grossly stable.  Evidence of pulmonary
 emphysema is noted.  Trace pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right middle lobe opacity, worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule consistent with patient's known lung cancer. 
 Additional bilateral pulmonary nodules better assessed on CT.
 
 Possible trace pleural effusions.
