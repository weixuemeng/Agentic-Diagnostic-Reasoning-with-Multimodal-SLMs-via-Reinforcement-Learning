 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:34 PM
  
  1. As on prior exam, severely limited due to patient positioning.
  2. A linear opacity projecting over the midline, vertically___, ___
  represent an enteric tube, however this is indeterminate.  If this is an
  enteric tube, it is positioned with the distal tip within thoracic esophagus,
  and requires repositioning.  There is no identifiable enteric tube which
  courses inferior to the diaphragm.
  3. Re identification of a left sided central line, presumably subclavian, with
  location of distal tip unable to be determined, likely within the mid SVC.
  4. Left lung appears grossly clear.  What is seen of the right lung appears
  clear without focal consolidation.
  5. No pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NG tube placement for anti-epileptic
 medications  // please evaluate NG tube placement      please evaluate NG tube
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs most recently dated ___ through
 ___ one at 17:31.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the right and the head covers the upper midline chest. 
 Aside from linear scar atelectasis at the base, left lung is clear and there
 is no left pleural abnormality.  Right lung base medially is obscured by the
 cardiac silhouette and ___ contain new consolidation.  Followup advised.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in the mid
 esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all side ports
 into the stomach.
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Thoracic aorta tortuous and mildly enlarged but not
 focally aneurysmal.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  The callus of
 healed right rib fractures contributes to pleural thickening along the lower
 costal margin.
