 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intraparenchymal bleed, now fever and leukocytosis, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing relatively
 severe parenchymal opacities are slightly increasing in density, showing a
 tendency to consolidate, notably at the right lung base.  A similar, but less
 extensive progression is seen at the left lung base.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion.  The perihilar components of the opacities are unchanged. 
 Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices.  Minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic sinus, so that a new right effusion cannot be excluded.
