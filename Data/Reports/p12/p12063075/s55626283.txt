                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with traumatic brain injury, fluid overload
 status post diuresis.  Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 13:05.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 4:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. 
 Lung volumes are slightly lower and there are moderate-sized layering
 bilateral effusions.  There is overall worsening perihilar airspace disease
 with more confluent area on the left mid lung.  Although this may represent
 worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in patient positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Bilateral
 shoulder prostheses incompletely visualized.
