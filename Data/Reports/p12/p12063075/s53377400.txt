 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage and intubation, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The parenchymal opacities that pre-existed have increased in
 extent as a consequence.  There are bilateral pleural effusions that are now
 moderate in extent and clearly visible on the image.  The monitoring and
 support devices are constant.
