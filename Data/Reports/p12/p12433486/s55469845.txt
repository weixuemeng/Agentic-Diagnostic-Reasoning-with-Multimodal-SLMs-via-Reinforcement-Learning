                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  Followup effusions and atelectasis.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted are pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques,
 one area in particular projecting over the right mid lung is more apparent on
 today's study than on prior images, but is felt to be a projectional area of
 increased opacity due to pleural plaques.  Attention should be paid to this
 area on followup.  Right IJ line is unchanged.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.
