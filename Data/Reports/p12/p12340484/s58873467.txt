                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate tube position in a patient with new intubation and OG
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of an
 endotracheal tube, which now terminates 2 cm from the carina.  The enteric
 tube is not visualized on this exam.  Diffuse patchy opacities are unchanged. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval repositioning of an endotracheal tube, now terminating 2 cm from
 the carina.  This can be pulled back 1-2 cm to terminate in the mid thoracic
 trachea.
 2. OG tube not visualized.
 3. Unchanged diffuse patchy opacities.  Increased retrocardiac opacity, likely
 atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 9:59 AM, 3 minutes after discovery
 of the findings.
