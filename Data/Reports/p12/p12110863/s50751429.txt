                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ at 1:06.  CTA chest ___ at 2:36.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is increasing opacification at the
 right base, which is most likely due to aspiration, given the acute change. 
 Otherwise, remaining lung fields are stable, including right lower lobe
 bronchiectasis and scarring.  There is continued diffuse interstitial
 prominence.  There is no definite pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is severely enlarged.  Post-CABG changes
 are stable.  A pacemaker is in place.  The wires are in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacity in the right lower lung zone is worrisome for
 aspiration.  Stable interstitial prominence and right lower lobe scaring.
