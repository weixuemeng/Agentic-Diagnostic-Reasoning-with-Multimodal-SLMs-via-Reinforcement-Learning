 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Peripheral fibrosis and mild architectural distortion
 in the right lower lobe.  No focal consolidation.  Pulmonary edema has
 resolved.  Bilateral pleural thickening.  Right atrial and ventricular
 pacemaker leads, the latter coursing in the mid RV.  Median sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Aorta
 is tortuous and unfolded.
 
 Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Interval fracture of
 the right humeral surgical neck, with an overriding fracture fragment.  This
 appears subacute, with partially corticated margins.

 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Interval right humeral neck fracture.
