                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker device is present with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement is likely present, similar compared to the
 prior study.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Pleural
 thickening within the lung apices is is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect a combination of
 atelectasis with chronic fibrotic changes, more so in the right lung base.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Remote fracture of the proximal right
 humerus is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar compared to the previous exam,
 with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar streaky airspace
 opacities could reflect a combination of atelectasis with chronic changes.
