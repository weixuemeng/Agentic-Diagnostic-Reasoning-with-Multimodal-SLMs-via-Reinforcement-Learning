 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Alcohol abuse, withdrawal seizures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 4.8 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is off the
 film, at least in the stomach.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is
 volume loss in both lower lungs, but no definite infiltrate.  There is some
 increased opacity at the right apex.  It is unclear if this is due to volume
 loss or infiltrate.  Followup is recommended.  There is a small left effusion.
