                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremic and fevers.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable frontal image of the chest.  The lung volumes are low.  There
 has been interval development of a linear opacity in the left mid lung which
 likely represents subsegmental atelectasis, probably in the lingula.  A
 calcified granuloma is seen in the medial right lung base.  Opacity is seen in
 the medial right lung base, which may refelect a combination of atelectasis
 and overlapping vascular structures.  There is patchy atelectasis at the left
 lung base.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  A feeding tube is noted
 in adequate position in the stomach.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable from prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar atelectasis and small right effusion.  Opacity at medial right
 lung base, which may refelect a combination of atelectasis and overlapping
 vascular structures.  This could be better assessed on follow-up radiographs.
