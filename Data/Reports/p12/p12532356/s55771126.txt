                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with COPD and biliary leak, for preoperative
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasalar atelectasis, left
 greater than right. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis.  There is enlargement of the bilateral hila, with increased
 density of the right hila, which may be related to enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery or lymphadenopathy.  There is mild vascular congestion
 without frank pulmonary edema.  There is cardiomegaly, the extent of which
 cannot be easily assessed on this image.   There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enlargement of the bilateral hila, with increased density of the right
 hila, which may be related to enlargement of the main pulmonary artery or
 lymphadenopathy. Recommend CT of the chest for additional evaluation. 
 
 2.  Small pleural effusion at the left base with adjacent atelectasis.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
