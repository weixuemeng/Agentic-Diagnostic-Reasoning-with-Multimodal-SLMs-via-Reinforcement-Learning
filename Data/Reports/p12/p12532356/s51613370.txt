 removed and replaced with a Dobbhoff tube, the opaque portion of which is just
 distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Right IJ catheter extends to the
 upper portion of the SVC.  Mild atelectatic changes are suggested at the left
 base without evidence of vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
 
 The outer portion of the right hemithorax has been excluded from the image.
