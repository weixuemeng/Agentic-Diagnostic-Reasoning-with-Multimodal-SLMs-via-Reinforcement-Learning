 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a mild to moderate left
 pleural effusion as well as a left retrocardiac atelectasis. The atelectasis
 in the left midlung zone, seen on the previous examination, is no longer
 visible.
 
 The lung volumes remain low and the size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
 upper range of normal.  The signs indicative of pulmonary edema are still
 present.  The patient is strongly rotated to the right, which limits the
 evaluation of the examination.
