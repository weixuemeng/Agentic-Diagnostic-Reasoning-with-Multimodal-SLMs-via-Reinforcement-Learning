 INDICATION:  History of dysphagia, vomiting.  Please evaluate cardiopulmonary
 status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided PIC line terminates in the mid to low SVC.  Overall,
 there has been interval improvement of the previously noted consolidation in
 the mid right lung.  Linear opacity in the mid left lung may be secondary to
 atelectasis as well.  Low lung volumes exaggerate the cardiomediastinal
 contours which are otherwise unremarkable.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Improved pulmonary edema.
 Improved pleural effusions. The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval improvement of the mid right lung consolidation compared to the
 prior exam from ___.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No new
 consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified.
 
 2. Improved mild pulmonary edema.
