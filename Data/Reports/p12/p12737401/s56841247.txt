                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF  // SOB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis is re-
 demonstrated.  It is difficult to exclude a right base consolidation.  No
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen on the left.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, similar in
 appearance compared the prior study.  Right base opacity may be due to
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation
 is not excluded.
 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
