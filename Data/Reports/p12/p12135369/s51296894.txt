                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // please evaluate for acute
 abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are subtle nodular opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, which may
 represent nipple shadows.  In addition, there is an opacity overlying the
 right anterior seventh rib, which may represent a chronic rib fracture. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Hyper expansion of the lungs and hyperlucency
 are most consistent with emphysema.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple compression deformities
 are seen within the thoracic spine, which are similar in appearance compared
 to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nodular opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, which likely represent
 nipple shadows.  In addition, there is an opacity overlying the right anterior
 seventh rib, which may represent callus at a rib fracture.  However, 1 are
 more pulmonary nodules cannot be excluded in this patient with emphysema.
 2. Multiple stable compression deformities within the thoracic spine.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Repeat radiograph with nipple markers and shallow obliques
 is recommended to exclude pulmonary nodules.
 
 NOTIFICATIONS:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:17 AM, 10 minutes
