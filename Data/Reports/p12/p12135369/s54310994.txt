                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Very severe COPD with clinical presentation consistent with
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is
 hyperinflation of the lungs with vascular deficiency in the apices, along with
 increased AP diameter and flattening of diaphragms, consistent with COPD. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 are normal.  No pleural abnormality is detected. Moderate to severe
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Changes consistent with COPD with no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
