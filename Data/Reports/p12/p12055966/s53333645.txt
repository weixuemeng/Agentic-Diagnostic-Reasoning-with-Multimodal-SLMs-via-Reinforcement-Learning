                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SDH multiple falls. s ternal bruising.  // eval
 for c spine fracture, intraabdoinal injury, sternal fracture, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same
 date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to rotation of the patient which in particular
 limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour.  An apparent right hilar
 mass is likely due to the obliquity of the projection.  In addition there are
 hazy opacities in the bilateral lungs with prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  A linear opacity in the
 right mid lung is consistent with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax seen. 
 Degenerative changes in the right shoulder.  Possible right-sided seventh rib
 fracture.  No pneumothorax seen.  Old healed fracture of the left seventh rib
 posteriorly.
