                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in technique, with rotation of mediastinal
 structures to the right, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  A few streaky
 opacities remain in the left lower lobe, but for the most part, opacities at
 both lung bases have mostly resolved, completely on the right side.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.
 Severe lower thoracic compression deformity appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving left basilar opacity.  Clearance of patchy right
 basilar opacity.
