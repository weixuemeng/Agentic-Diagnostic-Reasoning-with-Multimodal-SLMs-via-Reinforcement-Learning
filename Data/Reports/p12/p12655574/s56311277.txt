                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar,
 allowing for differences in technique.  There is a persistent opacity along
 the left lower lung, probably within the lingula, but improved somewhat. 
 Opacities in the right mid and lower lungs persist with little if any definite
 change, allowing for differences in technique.  The chronicity of these is
 uncertain.  Moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lung opacities; improving dominant opacity in
 the left lower lung.  Follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution.
