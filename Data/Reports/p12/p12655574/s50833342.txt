                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is better aeration at the left lung base with decreased streaky left
 posterior basilar opacities.  Patchy right basilar opacity has increased
 slightly, but is highly non-specific and probably compatible with atelectasis.
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Bones appear demineralized.  A severe mid thoracic compression
 deformity appears unchanged.  Milder lower thoracic compression deformities
 are also probably unchanged, although better depicted on this study. 
 Left-sided rib fractures appear old and non-displaced.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased patchy right basilar opacity, which could be seen with
 atelectasis.  Aspiration or pneumonia are not completely excluded, however. 
 Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to re-evaluate if needed
 clinically.
 
 2.  Improved left basilar aeration.
 
 3.  Stable compression deformities, mild to moderate rightward convex
 thoracolumbar curvature, and left-sided rib fractures, which appear old.
