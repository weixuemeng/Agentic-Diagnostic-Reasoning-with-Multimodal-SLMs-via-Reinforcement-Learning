                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotensive, confused and concern exists for possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for small differences in technique.  There are patchy new basilar
 opacities with hazy density in the right costophrenic sulcus and more streaky
 left basilar opacities.  These are more typical of atelectasis than pneumonia.
 There is no evidence for congestive heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky and vague basilar opacities, more suggestive of
 atelectasis than pneumonia, but if pneumonia is a continuing potential
 clinical concern then short-term followup radiographs could be considered.
