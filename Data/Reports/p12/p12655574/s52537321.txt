                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain and hypoxia.  Assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung
 volumes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary interstitial edema is noted.  Heart size is normal.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mid thoracic
 vertebral body compression deformity is longstanding.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with associated small
 pleural effusions is new from prior exam.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Post diuresis CXR advised.
