                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities including within the right mid lung field could
 reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body is unchanged, with remote right-sided rib and mid
 clavicular fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.
