                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Reported swallowing of 10 mm dental tool.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with streaky opacity suggesting atelectasis and volume loss. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated. 
 The lungs appear otherwise clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable. 
 Projecting over the left upper quadrant, probably along the gastric cardia is
 a linear radiodense foreign body measuring about 2.5 cm in length but only up
 to 3 mm in width.  It might be in part along the gastroesophageal junction and
 not fully within the stomach or within the cardia of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Linear radiodense foreign body projecting over the medial left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen in an area which corresponds to the gastroesophageal
 junction and gastric cardia.  
 
 2.  Mild volume loss at the left lung base.
