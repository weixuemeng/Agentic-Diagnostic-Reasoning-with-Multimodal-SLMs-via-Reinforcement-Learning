                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with open abdomen, oliguric renal failure //
 presence of interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Clearing of the right base is
 consistent with decrease in size of the pleural effusion and improved
 aeration. Persistent retrocardiac opacity corresponds to atelectasis and
 probable left pleural effusion. There is moderate pulmonary edema.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Monitoring and support
 devices are in the appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Stable retrocardiac opacity, consistent with small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.
