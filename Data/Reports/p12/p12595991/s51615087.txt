                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads
 terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, new from
 the prior study.  Focal opacities at lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions may be present.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  More focal opacities at lung bases may reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
