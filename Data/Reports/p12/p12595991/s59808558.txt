                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with new right IJ central venous line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Right IJ central venous catheter projects over the right atrium.  An ICD
 pacing device with biventricular leads appears unchanged in position.  Lung
 volumes remain low with right basilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval placement of a right IJ catheter with tip in the right atrium,
 consider pulling back by 3 cm for optimal placement.
 
 2. Otherwise, no substantial changes compared to the prior examination.
