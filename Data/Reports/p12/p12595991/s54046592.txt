                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Triple-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to
 the expected position of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary
 sinus.  The lead extending to the coronary sinus, the distal aspect of which
 is partially obscured by the overlying battery pack.  There are extremely low
 lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  The left lung base
 is obscured by patient's overlying battery packs and not well evaluated. 
 Right basilar atelectasis is seen.  There is blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, which may be due to small pleural effusion.  Aortic knob
 calcification is again seen.  The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable.  There
 is gaseous distention of the stomach and possibly the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal evaluation of the left mid to lower lung due to
 overlying battery pack.  If this is areas of high clinical concern, consider
 repeat with re-positioning of the patient.  There are extremely low lung
 volumes.  Right basilar atelectasis is seen.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle could be due to small pleural effusion.  
 
 Gaseous distention of the stomach and possibly of the bowel.
