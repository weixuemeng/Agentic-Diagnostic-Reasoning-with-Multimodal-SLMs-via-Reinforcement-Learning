 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:11 PM
  ET tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes. Right perihilar
  opacity could reflect crowding of bronchovascular structures. However, an
  underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Attention to follow
  up recommened. Mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomegaly.

 AP CHEST 7:29 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with systolic heart failure, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion have increased,
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia. 
 Vascular deficiency in the lung apices, particularly the right suggests
 emphysema.  Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective
 positions.  ET tube in standard placement.  No pneumothorax or appreciable
 pleural effusion.
