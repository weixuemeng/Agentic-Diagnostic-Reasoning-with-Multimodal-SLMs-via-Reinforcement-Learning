 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  STEMI, hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly
 increasing evidence of pulmonary edema.  Otherwise, no relevant changes are
 seen.  Bilateral minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses suggests the
 presence of mild pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
