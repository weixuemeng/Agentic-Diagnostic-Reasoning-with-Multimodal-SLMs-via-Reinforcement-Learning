                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, status post CPR.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could relate to
 prominent vascular structures, although underlying consolidation due to
 aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a
 trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  Right
 paratracheal opacity is seen, which could be due to prominent vascular
 structures; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Chronic-appearing deformity of the proximal left humerus is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Right paratracheal opacity could be due to pulmonary vascular structures
 though underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally, bibasilar
 opacities may relate to prominent vascular structures, although underlying
 aspiration is not excluded.
