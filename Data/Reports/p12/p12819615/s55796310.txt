                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes result in accentuation of the cardiac silhouette size which
 appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky and linear bibasilar
 opacities are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cervical spinal
 fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.  There are mild multilevel
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly.
