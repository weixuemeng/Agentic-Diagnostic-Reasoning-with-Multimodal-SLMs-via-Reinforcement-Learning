 bibasilar mild atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding which somewhat limits
 the evaluation for a subtle pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar atelectasis, no convincing signs of pneumonia.
