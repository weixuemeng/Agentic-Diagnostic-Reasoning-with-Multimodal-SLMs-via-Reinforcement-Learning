                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, shortness of breath and fevers,
 question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and CT trachea on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Bibasilar opacities are
 unchanged and represent either atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is
 hyperinflation of the lungs and flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 obstructive lung disease.  A Y-type tracheal stent is better seen on the
 lateral view and in place.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged bibasilar opacifications, representing either atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  Y-type tracheal stent in place.
 
 3.  Lung changes consistent with COPD.
