                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with an episode of tracheal stent clogging, improved
 during transport from an outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Tracheal CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs with
 flattening of hemidiaphragms.  Increased AP diameter of the chest is apparent.
 Costophrenic angles are blunted, suggestive of trace pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar opacities are noted.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Subtle rounded lucencies and linear opacities, likely correspond to underlying
 emphysema.  Visualized osseous structures are intact.  Tracheal stent is fully
 characterized on this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hyperextending lungs with flattened diaphragms, compatible with COPD.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or aspiration with possible
 trace pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Tracheal stent is not characterized.  Further assessment with CT or review
 of outside CT exams would be helpful, if available.
