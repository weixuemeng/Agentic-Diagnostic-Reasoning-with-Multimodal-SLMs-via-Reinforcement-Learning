                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tightness, to assess for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.  There is minimal asymmetry of opacification at the right base
 medially.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent an area
 of consolidation, though it may merely reflect fortuitous overlap of pulmonary
 markings.
