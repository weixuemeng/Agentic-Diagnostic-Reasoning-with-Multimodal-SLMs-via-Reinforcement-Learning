                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with productive cough and fever,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size has increased mildly. 
 There is no typical configurational abnormality.  Thoracic aorta appearance is
 stable and a mild general widening and elongation is noted as before, but no
 local aneurysmatic bulges can be identified.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates now an upper zone re-distribution pattern and there is some
 perivascular haze on the lung bases.  The latter finding coincides with mild
 blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.  These findings are
 subtle but are confirmed when comparison is made with the previous chest
 examination of ___.  There is no evidence of new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic appearance.  No pneumothorax is seen in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase of heart size and findings of mild degree of
 chronic CHF.  Acute pulmonary infiltrates cannot be identified.
