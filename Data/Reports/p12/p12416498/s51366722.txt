                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with fever  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided PICC is seen with tip projecting over the RA SVC junction as on
 prior.  Lung volumes are relatively low There are patchy bibasilar opacities,
 more confluent at the left lung base than at the right.  Superiorly, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities, more confluent on the left than on the right.  These
 could be due to atelectasis noting that infection is entirely possible in the
 proper clinical setting.  Consider repeat exam with PA and lateral with better
 inspiratory effort for more detailed evaluation.
