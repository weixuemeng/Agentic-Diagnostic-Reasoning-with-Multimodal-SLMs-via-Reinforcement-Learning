                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains markedly tortuous with diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Hilar contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Clips are again noted within the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Old right sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
