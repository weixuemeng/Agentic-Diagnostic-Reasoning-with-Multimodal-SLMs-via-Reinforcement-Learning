                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were provided with patient
 positioned upright.  Lung volumes are low.  There are lower lobe opacities,
 most notable in the right and left perihilar regions.  While this may in part
 reflect crowding of bronchovasculature, a component of pneumonia is likely
 present.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size cannot be
 assessed.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable opacities in the right and left
 perihilar regions concerning for pneumonia.  Consider a followup with improved
 inspiratory effort to better assess.
