 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 No evidence of pneumonia.  No other pathologic processes in the lung
 parenchyma.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  A rounded structure projects over the seventh right rib
 and corresponds to callus from an old fractured.  In retrospect, the original
 fracture was already seen on the chest x-ray from ___.  The
 lesion should not be mistaken as a lung nodule.
