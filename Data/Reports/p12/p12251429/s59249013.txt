                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, there are no
 definite new areas of consolidation to suggest a site of infection.  If
 clinical suspicion persists, repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level
 may be helpful.
