                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with streaky bibasilar opacities.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection is not completely excluded, and consider repeat
 radiographs with improved inspiratory effort when the patient is able.
