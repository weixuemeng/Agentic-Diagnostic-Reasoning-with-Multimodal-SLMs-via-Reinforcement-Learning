                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 853  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chronic cough, evaluation for infection
 or other cause.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 853 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes remain
 somewhat diminished, and there is a slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 of uncertain significance.  A nodular opacity in the right hemithorax
 involving the right seventh posterolateral rib likely represents callus
 formation related to a remote fracture.  No focal airspace consolidation is
 seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the mid thoracic spine.  No acute bony
 abnormality appreciated.  Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with
 prior cholecystectomy.  Narrowing of the right acromiohumeral distance
 suggests prior rotator cuff injury.
