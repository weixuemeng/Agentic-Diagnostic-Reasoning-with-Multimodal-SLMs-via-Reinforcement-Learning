                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  A right-sided dual-lumen pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is relatively
 unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Lung volumes are
 decreased from the prior study, which causes crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Small right pleural effusion has developed from the prior study,
 and there is mild patchy opacity in the right lung base which may represent
 area of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion and patchy opacity in the right lung
 base which may reflect atelectasis.
