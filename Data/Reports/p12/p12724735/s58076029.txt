 Multiple prior radiographs dated back to ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 has been stable compared to prior exams dated back to ___.  Diffuse
 opacities are seen throughout the left hemi thorax, predominantly overlying
 the mid left lung.  A left-sided IJ is seen, with the tip likely in the
 ipsilateral brachiocephalic/internal jugular vein junction. A right-sided
 hemodialysis catheter is seen, terminating in the right atrium, unchanged in
 position compared to the prior exam. There is no large pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.

 Left-sided IJ line terminates likely in the left ipsilateral brachiocephalic
 vein/internal jugular vein junction.
 
 Diffuse opacities overlying the mid left lung, may be secondary to pneumonia.
