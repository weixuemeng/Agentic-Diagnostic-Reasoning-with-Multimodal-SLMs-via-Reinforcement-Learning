                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Please ignore the previous report that belongs to different patient
 
 The report on this patient chest radiograph is as following
 
 Comparison:  ___
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carinal.  NG tube tip is in
 the stomach.
 
 Cardiac silhouette appears to be substantially increased as compared to the
 previous examination, by more than 1 cm that might potentially represent
 different phases of inspiration but interval accumulation of pericardial
 effusion is a possibility.  Patient continues to be in pulmonary edema,
 interstitial that appears to be progressed since the prior study.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with h/o HTN, Alport's syndrome s/p 2 renal transplants with
 chronic graft failure, presenting in hypertensive urgency with respiratory
 distress.  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study the has been insertion of pigtail catheter in the left
 pleural space at the mid aspect.  As a consequence there has been interval
 substantial decrease in the amount of pleural effusion in particular at the
 basal aspect of the pleura.  Currently the effusion continues to be loculated
 containing multiple foci of air, most likely trapped within the effusion.  The
 prior study there has been interval elevation of the hemidiaphragm, slight
 potentially due to decrease in the amount of pleural fluid with subsequent
 slight right mediastinal shift.  Left chest wall air is demonstrated along the
 tract of the catheter.  No pneumothorax seen outside of the fluid collection. 
 No appreciable pericardial effusion is seen.  Minimal amount of right pleural
 fluid is demonstrated, increased since the prior study.
 
 Imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrate large cortical cyst in the
 left kidney as well as gallbladder sludge and foci of calcification in the
 right kidney.
 
 Airways are patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally except fall left
 lower lobe and lingula where atelectasis is noted most likely due to
 combination of effusion and elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Except for minimal a
 right lower lung atelectasis right lung is clear.  Off note is soft tissue
 lesion, 2.3 x 1.7 cm, pleural or extrapleural based, series 4, image 148,
 unchanged in appearance since previous CT obtained 2 days ago.
 
 No lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm
 demonstrated.  Erosive changes at the manubrial sternal joint suggesting prior
 inflammation as previously.  Septal thickening in the left upper lobe is
 minimal.  Besides left lower lobe atelectasis no new findings demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size in loculated left pleural effusion after placement
 of the pigtail catheter.  Multiple loculated bubbles of air.  Subcutaneous
 air.
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation, most likely a combination of atelectasis or
 infection with no possibility to exclude underlying mass.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the right chest wall/pleural lesion.  Potentially as
 previously suggested 8 might be related to previous fracture of the left
 seventh rib but followup is required to exclude the possibility of neoplastic
 origin.
 
 No changes in the intra-abdominal findings demonstrated but there is higher
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm potentially due to drainage of pleural
 effusion with more pronounced right mediastinal shift.
