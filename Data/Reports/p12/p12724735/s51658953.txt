  Interval improvement in degree of mild pulmonary edema with small persistent
  bilateral effusions.
  Enlarged cardiac silhouette which could potentially be due to cardiomegaly
  although pericardial effusion could also have this appearance.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with ESRD, CHF, new a-fib, O2 requirement  // Eval for acute
 process, attn to CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been slight interval improvement in the
 degree of pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles
 suggests small bilateral effusions, likely decreased from prior.  Streaky
 retrocardiac and right basilar opacities are   likely atelectasis.  Moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar compared to prior. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aorta.  Right chest wall
 tunneled venous catheter is noted as well surgical clips of the upper
 mediastinum on the left.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in degree of mild pulmonary edema with small persistent
 bilateral effusions.
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette which could potentially be due to cardiomegaly
 although pericardial effusion could also have this appearance.
