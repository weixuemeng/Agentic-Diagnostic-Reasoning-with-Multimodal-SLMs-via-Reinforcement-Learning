                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y.o F with ESRD, on HD, presenting with dyspnea, found to have
 pulmonary edema, now s/p 4L fluid removal  // interval change of pulmonary
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 06:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a dual-lumen catheter with both lumens overlying the right
 atrium.  There is moderate cardiomegaly, probably less pronounced and with
 better definition of the cardiomediastinal borders.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but there has been marked improvement in the CHF/ remain
 pulmonary edema findings.  Mild residual vascular blurring a is present. 
 Probable residual left base atelectasis, seen is increased retrocardiac
 density, but the left hemidiaphragm is now distinctly visible.  No gross
 effusion.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Clips noted over left thoracic inlet.  Densely calcified tortuous
 splenic artery is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked interval improvement in the CHF findings.  Now only minimal residual
 upper zone redistribution and slight vascular blurring.
