                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, leg pain  //
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the right
 atrium, unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours similar.  Multiple clips are again seen projecting over
 the left superior mediastinum.  There is persistent mild pulmonary edema,
 slightly improved in the interval with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 likely slightly increased from the prior study.  More focal patchy opacities
 at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, perhaps minimally improved in the interval, with
 slightly increased small bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
