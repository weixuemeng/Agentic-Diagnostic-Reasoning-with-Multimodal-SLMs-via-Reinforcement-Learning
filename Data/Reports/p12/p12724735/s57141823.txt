                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, hypoxia  // eval effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are parenchymal opacities, most pronounced at the lung bases
 bilaterally, which most likely represents pulmonary edema.  However, pneumonia
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There are likely small pleural effusions
 bilaterally.  There is upper zone redistribution.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.
 
 Right-sided hemodialysis dual-lumen catheter terminates in the right atrium. 
 Note is made of surgical clips in the left paratracheal region, near the left
 lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Parenchymal opacities predominantly at the lung bases along with probable
 pleural effusions most likely represents pulmonary edema.  However, infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
