                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 The lungs are better aerated and more expanded.  Pulmonary edema has improved.
 Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Right pleural effusion is probably small to
 moderate, more conspicuous than before.  Retrocardiac opacities are a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lines and
 tubes are in standard position.
