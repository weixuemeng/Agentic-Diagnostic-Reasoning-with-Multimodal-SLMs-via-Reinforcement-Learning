                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Status post intubation at outside hospital.
 Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable frontal radiograph shows somewhat low lung
 volumes.  ET tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube courses
 below the left hemidiaphragm into the stomach.  There are bilateral hazy
 opacities, right greater than left, and left retrocardiac opacity.  There is
 no large pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There are surgical clips
 projecting over the right axilla.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral, right greater than left, hazy opacities and left retrocardiac
 opacity may reflect asymmetric edema possibly with superimposed infection. 
 2.  ET tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm from the carina, could withdraw 1
 to 2 cm. Enteric tube courses into the stomach.
