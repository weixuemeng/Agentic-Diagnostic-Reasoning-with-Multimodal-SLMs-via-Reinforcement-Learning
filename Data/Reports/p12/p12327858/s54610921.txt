                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PEA, intubated with pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular central venous line is unchanged.  The
 endotracheal tube tip and enteric tube are appropriately positioned. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged, and there is increased opacity at
 the right apex with improved airspace in the left apex indicating
 re-distribution of pulmonary edema.  Right middle and lower zone opacities are
 slightly worse, indicative of an infectious process.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of right middle and lower lung zone opacities
 concerning for infection with re-distribution of pulmonary edema which is now
 more predominant on the right.
