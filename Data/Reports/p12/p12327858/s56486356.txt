                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PEA arrest with pneumonia.  Evaluate for infiltrate and
 assess edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior studies
 demonstrates slight decrease in lung volumes with worsening opacification at
 the right middle and lower lung zonesas well as the left base, likely
 redistribution of pulmonary edema, although fluctuating atelectasis,
 suggestive of aspiration, may be entertained.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists and the cardiac contour is unchanged.  Monitoring and support devices
 are stable.  Pleural effusions are presumed but no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fluctuating bilateral opacities could be accounted for by
 redistribution of pulmonary edema or due to aspiration.
