 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  At both the right and the left lung bases, more extensive on the
 left than on the right, areas of parenchymal opacity are seen.  The opacities
 show air bronchograms and are ill-defined.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, pneumonia must be suspected.  There is minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
