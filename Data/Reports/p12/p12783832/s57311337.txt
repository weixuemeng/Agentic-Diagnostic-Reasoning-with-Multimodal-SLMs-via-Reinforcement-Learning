                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/hx of nephrolithiasis s/p right-sided ESWL on ___ at___ c/b hypotension and RP and right-sided perinephric hematoma,
 transferred to ___ for interventional radiology, initially hypotensive with
 elevated lactate, BP stable after 3u prbcs.  Has significant rales on right
 side  // eval for pleural effusion, pulm edema.
 
 COMPARISON:
 None available
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiomediastinal contours and
 resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  With
 this limitation in mind, patchy and linear bibasilar opacities most likely
 represent atelectasis although a secondary process such as aspiration is
 possible.  Lungs are otherwise clear and there are no definite pleural
 effusions.
