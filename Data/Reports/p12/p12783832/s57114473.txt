                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and CTA torso dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Hazy opacification of the right lung base is similar to the recent prior study
 and consistent with the moderate pleural effusion seen on recent CTA chest. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Moderate right pleural effusion.
 3. No focal consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax.
