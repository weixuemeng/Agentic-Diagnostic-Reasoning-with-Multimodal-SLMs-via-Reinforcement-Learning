                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates hazy prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature, and azygous vein, and hila.  In addition to stable mild
 to moderate cardiomegaly, findings suggest mild pulmonary edema.  Increased
 interstitial markings may be due to increased fibrosis compared to one year
 prior or relate to interstitial edema superimposed on chronic stable lung
 disease. No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia identified. Low lung
 volumes are noted bilaterally with eventration of the right hemidiaphragm and
 interposition of bowel between the liver and diaphragm with adjacent
 atelectasis.   No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema. Increased prominence of
 interstitum may be due to edema superimposed on chronic lung disease or less
 likely due interval worsening of fibrosis.
