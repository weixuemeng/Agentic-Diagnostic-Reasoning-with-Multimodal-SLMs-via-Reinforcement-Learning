                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are lower in volume
 than the prior study giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding. 
 Linear opacities in the right mid lung and left lower lung are consistent with
 known scarring/fibrosis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without acute intrathoracic process.
