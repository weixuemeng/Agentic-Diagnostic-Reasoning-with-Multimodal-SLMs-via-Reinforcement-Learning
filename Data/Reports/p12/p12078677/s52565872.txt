                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent aspiration at ___. Now
 worse with hypoxia, confusion and crackles at Rt base Has ___'s Disease
 and AS with h/o CHF  // reevaluate for pneumonia    reevaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that
 accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Extensive interstitial
 prominence is again seen throughout both lungs.  This is consistent with
 significant congestive heart failure, though the possibility of some chronic
 pulmonary disease could be considered.  Basilar atelectatic changes are seen
 bilaterally.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
