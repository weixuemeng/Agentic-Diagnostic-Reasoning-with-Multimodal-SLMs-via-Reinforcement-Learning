                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB  // pulm edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.
 
 Low lung volumes as well as poor patient positioning limits assessment.
 Coarsened interstitial lung markings reflect known interstitial lung disease. 
 A superimposed edema is difficult to exclude.  However, there is increased
 focal opacity in the right upper lobe which is concerning for a superimposed
 pneumonia.  Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged
 with the heart size is difficult to reliably assessed.  Gas-filled bowel loops
 are seen below the right and left hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures appear
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacity likely reflects known interstitial lung disease,
 difficult to exclude a superimposed edema.  Focal right upper lobe opacities
 concerning for pneumonia.
