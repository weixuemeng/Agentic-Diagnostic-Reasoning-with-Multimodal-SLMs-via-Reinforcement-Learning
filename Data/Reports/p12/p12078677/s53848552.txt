                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, dyspnea. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to study of ___ there it is interval improvement in
 bilateral interstitial opacities.  Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged in appearance. Colonic interposition is noted on the
 right. A linear opacity in the right lower lobe is seen. Heart size,
 mediastinal contour and hila are within normal limits.  Limited assessment of
 osseous structures demonstrates healed right rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Linear opacity in right lower lobe is most consistent with atelectasis
 however may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
