                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ disease complicated by aspiration pneumonia, shortness of
 breath, hypoxia, fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The hepatic flexure is interposed between the liver and the diaphragm.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis though
 aspiration or infection is difficult to exclude.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. 
 Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is re- demonstrated with a
 mild compression deformity noted at the thoracolumbar junction, unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities in the lung bases
 most likely reflective of atelectasis.  Please note that aspiration or
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
