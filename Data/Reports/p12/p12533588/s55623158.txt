 overload      ? interval change vs volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 22:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 21:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  The faint opacities in the right upper lobe have
 improved but there is increasing interstitial prominence as well as more focal
 patchy opacity at the left base.  Given the acute fluctuations, findings favor
 mild interstitial edema rather than an infectious process.  No large
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
