 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:31 AM
  
  
  Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
  been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately
  3 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates in the body of the stomach. 
  Tip of the right PICC is in the low SVC, heading towards the cavoatrial
  junction.
  Mild pulmonary edema is likely unchanged, accounting for lower lung volumes. 
  No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
