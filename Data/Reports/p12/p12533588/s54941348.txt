                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, assessment for free air at the level of the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a right subdiaphragmatic lucency.  The combination of frontal and lateral
 radiograph, however, suggests today that this lucency is caused by a mildly
 dilated colon loop interposed between the abdominal wall and the liver.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, sternal wires after valvular repair.  Normal lung
 volumes.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
