                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The
 hilar contours are normal, and the pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
