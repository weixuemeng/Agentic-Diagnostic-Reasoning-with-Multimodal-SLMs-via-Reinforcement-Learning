                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably unchanged allowing for the limitations of technique. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are patchy opacities at
 both lung bases that are poorly delineated, but early pneumonia, atelectasis
 or even areas of slight aspiration are possible.  This is all seen in the
 background of a mild interstitial abnormality suggesting fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, although technique
 is limited.  Patchy basilar opacities, non-specific.  Repeat radiographs may
 be helpful in short-term follow-up to re-assess; preferably, this could be
 done with standard PA and lateral technique if feasible clinically.
