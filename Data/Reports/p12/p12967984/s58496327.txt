                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and possible new atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta appears dilated, but unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 likely relates to low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is a rounded opacity seen within the right mid lung field,
 which could reflect an area of developing infection.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy rounded opacity within the right mid lung field which is nonspecific,
 but could reflect an area of developing infection.
