                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated  // confirm ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.9 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip courses below the gastroesophageal junction with tip off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is widened as a result of low lung volumes and supine
 technique.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is present.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam though the
 extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  Clips are
 noted projecting over the left perihilar region and left chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip in standard position.  Enteric tube courses below the
 gastroesophageal junction with the tip off the inferior borders of the film.
 2. Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
