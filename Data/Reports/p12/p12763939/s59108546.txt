                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:33 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with evolving pneumonia after diaphragmatic
 repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Aside from subsegmental atelectasis in the suprahilar right mid lung, the
 right lung is clear.  Left lung is better aerated today than it was on
 ___ and therefore I doubt pneumonia is active on that side.  There may
 be a small left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 normal and the relative positions of the two hemidiaphragms are physiologic.
 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Feeding tube passes into the stomach
 and out of view.
