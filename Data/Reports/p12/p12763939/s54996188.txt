                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evolving pneumonia after diaphragmatic repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Retrocardiac opacification and hazy opacification at the left base
 are again seen, consistent with lower lobe volume loss and pleural effusion. 
 Right lung is essentially clear.  Tracheostomy tube and enteric tube remain in
 place.
