                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central venous line is noted with the tip terminating in the
 lower right atrium/superior IVC.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted
 coursing along the right side of the body.  Lung volumes are low.  There are
 moderate -large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  The
 upper lungs are grossly clear.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 evaluate given the patient body habitus and pleural fluid, but there appears
 to be a least moderate cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bilateral, moderate-large pleural effusions, moderate
 central vascular congestion, and cardiomegaly- likely reflects underlying
 pulmonary edema.
