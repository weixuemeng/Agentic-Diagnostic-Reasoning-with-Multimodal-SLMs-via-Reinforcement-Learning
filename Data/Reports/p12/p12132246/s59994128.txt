                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post valve sparing root
 replacement.  Coronary artery re-implantation, evaluate for post-operative
 fever source.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar PA and lateral
 chest examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy and remaining
 significant enlargement of the heart silhouette remains.  The pulmonary
 vascular pattern does not show increased congestion and is practically
 unaltered in comparison with the next preceding examination.  The left-sided
 basal and retrocardiac positioned atelectatic left lower lung changes have
 regressed moderately and show improved aeration.  Similarly basal densities on
 the right base appear more translucent and the right lateral pleural sinus
 remains free.  On the lateral view, the mostly posteriorly located atelectatic
 densities demonstrate some degree of improved central aeration.  No new other
 parenchymal infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax remains in the apical
 area.
 
 Progressively improving bilateral basal atelectasis which appeared
 post-operatively.  Improvement is observed during the latest two-day
 examination interval but some atelectatic changes remain. Additional
 comparison is made with the pre-operative chest examination of ___,
 it can be noted that moderate cardiac enlargement existed already on the
 pre-operative chest examination.  The atelectatic changes on both bases,
 however, did not exist at that time.
