 persistent fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.

 is prominence of the central vasculature without overt signs of pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. A tortuous and a dilated aorta is again noted.  Sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Decrease in heart size which remains mildly enlarged without an
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
