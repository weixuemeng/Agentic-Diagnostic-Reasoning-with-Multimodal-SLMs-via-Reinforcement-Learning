                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic root replacement, evaluation for pleural
 effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly improved
 ventilation at the lung bases, more evident on the left than on the right.  On
 the right, areas of basal atelectasis persist.  Visible on the lateral
 radiograph only are bilateral pleural effusions of mild to moderate extent. 
 The lateral radiograph also shows mildly distended bowel loops as well as
 post-operative remnant air inclusions.  
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The sternal wires are of unchanged
 alignment.
