                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with babesios and SOB  // Eval for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, pulmonary edema has
 mildly improved, though multifocal consolidations in the right lung have
 probably worsened and may reflect aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Significant left deviation of the trachea is unchanged and
 likely suggests thyroid enlargement or mass, though a thoracic aortic aneurysm
 cannot be definitively excluded based on this study alone.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema is mildly improved.
 2. Multifocal parenchymal consolidations, most notable in the right lung, are
 likely worse and may reflect aspiration.
