                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the heart and mediastinal
 contours, with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  No hilar enlargement is seen, and there is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Hazy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Probable bibasilar
 atelectasis, though infection is difficult to exclude.
