                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___  F w/ hx asthma, esophageal CA, here w/ tachypnea,
 new O2 requirement, bilateral ___ edema- evaluate for infiltrate, CHF  //
 infiltrate, CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided port is seen, with catheter tip not well seen but likely
 terminating in the low SVC. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable. Linear bilateral perihilar, infrahilar, and basilar
 opacities may in part relate to atelectasis and scarring with possible
 underlying bronchiectasis and other chronic lung disease, however underlying
 infection or edema is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
