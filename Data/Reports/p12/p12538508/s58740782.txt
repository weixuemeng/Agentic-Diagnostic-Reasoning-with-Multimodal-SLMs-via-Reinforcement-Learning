                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable AP radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP radiograph was provided.
 
 There is increased opacity at the right base which may be due to infectious
 process or aspiration. Rounded density projecting over the right ninth
 posterior rib is likely a nipple shadow and can be followed on subsequent
 radiographs. A chronic moderate-sized left pleural effusion is similar in
 appearance to the prior study.  Overlying opacities are likely atelectasis.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity at the right base may represent infection or
 aspiration. Stable moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
