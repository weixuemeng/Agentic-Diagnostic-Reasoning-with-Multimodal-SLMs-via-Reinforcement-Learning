                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemia and diffuse airspace opacities  //
 Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, stable on the left, more coalescent
 on the right. This is probably diffuse pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage in a
 patient with emphysema. Heart size is large but indeterminate because heart
 borders are obscured by lung abnormality. Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow their expected courses. Small if
 not moderate bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax.
