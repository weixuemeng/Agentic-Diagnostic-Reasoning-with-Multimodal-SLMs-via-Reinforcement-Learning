 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a a mild increase in extent
 and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.  Most likely, the
 opacities reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. Unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly and normal alignment of the sternal wires as well as
 normal course of the pacemaker wires. There is unchanged blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, potentially resulting from a small left pleural effusion.
