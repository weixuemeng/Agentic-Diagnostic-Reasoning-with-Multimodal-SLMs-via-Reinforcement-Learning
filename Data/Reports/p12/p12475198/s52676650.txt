                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery
 disease, congestive heart failure, and hypoxemia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is no change in extremely irregular opacification
 of both lungs, mostly involving the right lung with slight interval
 improvement in particular in the right mid lung.  This improvement, which is
 rapid, most likely reflects the element of pulmonary edema.   Pneumonia
 improvement over such a short period of time would be less likely, although
 still possible .
