 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation of post-operative changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The sternal wires are in constant alignment.  The lung volumes are
 slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions with subsequent minimal areas of atelectasis at the lung
 bases continue to be present, but the pre-existing mild retrocardiac
 atelectasis has improved.  No new parenchymal opacities suggestive of
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.
