                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. Lung volumes are low, with bronchovascular crowding. Streaky
 opacity in the right base likely represents atelectasis.  There is no definite
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There may be a trace left pleural
 effusion. Rightward curvature of the thoracic spine is again seen and grossly
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes, with right base atelectasis.
 2. Trace left pleural effusion.
