                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, dementia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views the chest were viewed.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 are well expanded without focal consolidations.  The previously noted nodular
 opacity at the right lung base is not clearly seen on the current study.
 Interstitial markings are again prominent, likely indicative of chronic lung
 disease.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumothorax or displaced rib fractures.
