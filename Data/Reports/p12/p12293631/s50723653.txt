                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup examination for a cortical left lower lobe pneumonia on
 prior chest x-ray.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The previously described left lung base rounded, retrocardiac opacity is not
 definitively visualized on this examination.  Redemonstrated are diffuse,
 coarse interstitial markings, most significant at the bilateral lung apices,
 unchanged from the prior examination. Non-specific septal lines are noted
 along the periphery of left lower lobe, new since the prior examination. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is no focal consolidation, 
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is grossly unremarkable.  There are no acute bony abnormalities detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia. 
 
 2.  Unchanged, diffuse parenchymal scarring, most significant at the bilateral
 lung apices. Non-specific left lower lobe septal lines.  
 
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
