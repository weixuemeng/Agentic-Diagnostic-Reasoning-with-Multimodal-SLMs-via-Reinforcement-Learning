                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  At the left base, there is a suggestion of a rounded opacity behind
 the cardiac silhouette, which was not definitely present on the prior exam. 
 Evaluation of this region is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes. 
 Biapical left worse than right scarring is noted.  No other focal opacity is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Scoliosis in the upper thoracic
 spine is unchanged.  Fracture of the proximal right humerus is old.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small focal opacity at the left base, which is poorly evaluated
 due to low lung volumes, may represent pneumonia.  If possible, a repeat
 radiograph with improved inspiration performed in the radiology department and
 including lateral view suggested to better characterize this opacity.
