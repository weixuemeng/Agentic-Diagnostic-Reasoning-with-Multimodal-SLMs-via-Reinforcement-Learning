                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, earlier with chest pain.  Assess for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits.  Aortic calcifications and prominence of
 the central pulmonary arteries are again noted.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm, prior chest CT confirms
 emphysema.  Linear scarring is again seen in the right middle and left lower
 lobes.  There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary edema, or
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes, mild
 dextroconvex scoliosis, and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament
 are again seen in the thoracic spine.  Minimal anterior wedging of several mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearance of the chest with COPD, but no evidence for acute
 abnormalities.
