                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right  rib pain  // evaluate for bony
 abnormality and/or lung infection      evaluate for bony abnormality and/or
 lung infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces.  No obvious chest wall abnormality.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
