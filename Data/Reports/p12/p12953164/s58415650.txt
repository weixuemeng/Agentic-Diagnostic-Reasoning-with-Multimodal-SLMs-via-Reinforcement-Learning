                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased prominence of reticulation, which suggests mild
 vascular congestion.  A meniscoid appearance of the left lateral costophrenic
 angle is new and suggests a trace effusion on the left only.  There is no
 pneumothorax or focal opacification.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
