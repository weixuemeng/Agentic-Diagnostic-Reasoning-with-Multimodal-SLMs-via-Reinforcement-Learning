 with new dyspnea and O2 requirement  // Eval pnthx vs effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, patchy opacity right base is more pronounced and
 there is a new small right pleural effusion. Atelectasis at the left base is
 also a more pronounced. No left pleural effusion.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Upper zone
 redistribution is again seen, unchanged, without other evidence of CHF. Chain
 sutures noted. In the right upper and mid zones.
 
 Again seen is a small amount of air beneath the right hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with recent surgery. Clips noted in the left costophrenic region.
 
 Also again seen subcutaneous emphysema overlying the lower left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy opacity and small effusion at the right base. The possibility of an
 early pneumonic infiltrate in this area cannot be excluded.
 
 Increased atelectasis at the left base, though the degree of retrocardiac
 opacity is slightly improved.
