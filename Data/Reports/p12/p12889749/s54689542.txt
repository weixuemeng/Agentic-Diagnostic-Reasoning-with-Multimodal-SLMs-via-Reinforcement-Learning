 prominent fat pad abutting the left heart border likely accounting for subtle
 opacity seen at this level.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures appear grossly
 intact.

 No acute intrathoracic process.  Left medial lung base opacity likely
 represents prominent epicardial fat pad.
