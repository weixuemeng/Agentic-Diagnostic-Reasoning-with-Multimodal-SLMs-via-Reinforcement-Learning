                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with worsening leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure and bilateral pleural effusions.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
