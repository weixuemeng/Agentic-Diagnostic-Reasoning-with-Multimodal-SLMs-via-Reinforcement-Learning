                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and leukocytosis  // evaluate for
 interval change, infiltrates, pneumothorax      evaluate for interval change,
 infiltrates, pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease and extensive prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with
 fibrosis and emphysema seen on the recent CT scan.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though this could be difficult to
 exclude in view of the extensive parenchymal changes and absence of a lateral
 view.
