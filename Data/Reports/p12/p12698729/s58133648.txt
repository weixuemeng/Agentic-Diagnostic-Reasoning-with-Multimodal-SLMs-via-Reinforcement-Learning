 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate size, predominantly basally located, right pneumothorax is noted
 with atelectasis of the right lung.  There is no substantial leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures noted.  Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with
 evidence of TAVR.  Hilar contours are unchanged.  Extensive fibrosis is seen
 within the lungs bilaterally as well as emphysema within the upper lobes,
 similar to that noted on the prior study.  No pleural effusion is present.  No
 pulmonary edema is clearly identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate-size, predominately basally located right pneumothorax without
 definite signs tension.  Extensive chronic fibrotic changes within the lungs
 with marked emphysema in the upper lobes.
