 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NGT in place, readjusted  // NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ at 09:55.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is an orogastric tube whose distal tip is not included on the image. 
 However it is below the GE junction and appears unchanged from the prior
 study.  There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the
 distal SVC.  Stent device projects over the heart.  There are coarse
 bronchovascular markings at the lung bases consistent with the known
 interstitial lung disease.  There is again seen a small lateral right
 hydropneumothorax, stable.
