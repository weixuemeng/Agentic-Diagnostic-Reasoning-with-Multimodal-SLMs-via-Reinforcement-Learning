                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man who is intubated  // Is there any movement of the
 ET tube?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam is technically limited due to exclusion of the lung apices from the
 radiograph.  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7.3 cm above the Carina, and
 could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable. Worsening right lower lobe collapse accompanied by a
 probable small right pleural effusion. Imaged portion of left lung is clear,
 but left and right apices have been excluded from the study, limiting
 assessment for pneumothorax or apical lung process.
