 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this day, the left base has
 essentially cleared. On the right, there is increasing opacification in the
 lower lungs with shift of the mediastinum a to that side. This is consistent
 with a mucous plugging causing partial collapse, possibly with some associated
 pleural effusion.
