 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 is now approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. An right PICC line extends to
 the mid portion of the SVC and nasogastric tube extends to the stomach.  There
 is continued opacification in the right lower zone, consistent with a layering
 effusion and substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe. Mild fullness of
 pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The
 left lung is essentially clear.
