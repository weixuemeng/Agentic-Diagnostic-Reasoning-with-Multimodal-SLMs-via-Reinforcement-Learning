                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains
 normal.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Similar as on the preceding chest
 examination, there is somewhat irregular peripheral pulmonary vasculature
 coinciding with relatively low-positioned diaphragms, all consistent with some
 degree of COPD.  A previously described local hazy small density overlying the
 anterior fourth rib on the right side appears unchanged.  No new pulmonary
 abnormalities are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain
 free.
 
 As before, prominent breast shadow soft tissue seen on the frontal view is
 compatible with some degree of gynecomastia and appears unchanged.
 
 Our record indicates that this patient has undergone several chest CTs in the
 past, the latest dated ___.  In this examination, multiple small
 pleural plaques and tiny right upper lobe densities were seen.  These findings
 were considered to be stable in comparison with preceding chest examinations. 
 At that time, the report from our department suggested a followup CT in about
 ___ years.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings on plain chest CT examination, thus no
 evidence of acute pneumonia.  Considering the chronic changes, the
 recommendation to have a followup examination stands  as before.
