                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVC with chest pain.  Please evaluate for
 any evidence of fracture or contusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes are normal.  There may be mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax detected.  Although
 chest radiograph is not optimal for evaluation of the chest cage after trauma,
 no evidence of rib fractures or other bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chest radiograph is
 not optimal for evaluation of the chest cage after trauma, but there is no
 evidence of rib fractures or other bony abnormalities on the current study.
