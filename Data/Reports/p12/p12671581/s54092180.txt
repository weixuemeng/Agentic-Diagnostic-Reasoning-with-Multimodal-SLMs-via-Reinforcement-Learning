                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible fall with neck pain, headache, shortness of breath and
 feeling of weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's chin obscures evaluation of the medial lung apices.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, with mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Diffuse aortic calcifications are again
 noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged, and hilar contours are
 stable.  Hyperinflation along with flattening of the diaphragms is re-
 demonstrated suggestive of underlying COPD.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly on the lateral view may suggest pleural thickening or trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis, there
 is no focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and possible trace bilateral pleural effusions
 versus pleural thickening.  Probable COPD.
