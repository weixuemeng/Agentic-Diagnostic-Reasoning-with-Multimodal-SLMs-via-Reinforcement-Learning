  Extensive new subcutaneous air overlying the chest and neck bilaterally. No
  evidence of pneumothorax. ET tube in the midtrachea. Given the interval change
  from earlier today and the history of laproscopic surgery today, these
  findings are likely either due to complications with instrumentation or
  possibly due to rupture of a gastrointestinal organ. Continued followup
  recommended.

 Heart size and mediastinum is within normal limits.  There is an endotracheal
 tube whose distal lead tip is at the level of clavicular heads.  Lungs are
 grossly clear allowing for the overlying subcutaneous emphysema.  There is
 extensive amount of subq emphysema seen throughout all the visualized soft
 tissues particularly along the base of the neck.  Please correlate with any
 recent intervention in these areas.  No free intraabdominal gas is seen
 underneath the hemidiaphragms.
