                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with unresponsive intubated in field
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is somewhat limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube
 terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within
 the stomach.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.
 Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is likely a
 small right pleural effusion. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution
 which may be accentuated by supine technique. No overt pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated. No large pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Limited exam.
 2. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 3. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection
 and/or aspiration are not excluded.
 4. Small right pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
