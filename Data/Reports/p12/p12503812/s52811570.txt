                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with forniers, also with o2 requirement  // eval for
 consolidation, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient appears to be kyphotic in position.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, pulmonary pulmonary arteries
 may be due to pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Left base streaky opacity is
 more likely due to atelectasis rather than consolidation.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due
 to patient position, but appears mildly enlarged.
