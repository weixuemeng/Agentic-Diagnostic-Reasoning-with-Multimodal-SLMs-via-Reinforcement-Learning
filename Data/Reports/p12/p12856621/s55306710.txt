 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison ___.  The lung volumes have decreased, reticular
 opacities in the subpleural lung regions reflect known fibrosis.  However, in
 the interval, there is an additional process with increase in size of the
 cardiac silhouette as well as increase in vascular diameters, likely
 reflecting mild pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Unchanged course
