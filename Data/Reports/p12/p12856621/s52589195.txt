                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, on amiodarone for ___ years, dry
 crackles on RLL  // Evaluate for fibrotic changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased bibasilar interstitial prominence could represent early pulmonary
 edema or interstitial lung disease, and amiodarone toxicity could have this
 appearance. If there are clinical signs of volume overload, diuresis could be
 attempted with repeat radiographs to assess for interval change, otherwise
 chest CT could be performed to evaluate these changes. The left chest wall
 biventricular pacemaker leads are in appropriate position. There is no
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  The heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar interstitial prominence could represent early pulmonary edema or
 interstitial lung disease, including amiodarone toxicity. Repeat radiographs
 following diuresis would distinguish between these two entities, or chest CT
 could be performed for further evaluation.
