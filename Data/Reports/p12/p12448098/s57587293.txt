                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, fevers  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___, chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection for addendum
 carcinoma.  Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, right greater
 than left.  Left hilar prominence appears increased from the prior chest
 radiograph, and may represent enlargement of the pulmonary artery versus hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  The heart size is normal.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased asymmetric left perihilar opacities, which may represent
 lymphadenopathy, enlarged pulmonary vasculature, or pneumonia.  Right lower
 lobe opacities are also noted and may represent multifocal pneumonia. 
 Recommend follow up in 4 weeks to document resolution.
