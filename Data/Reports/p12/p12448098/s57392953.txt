                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right VATS right lower lobe wedge resection with recent
 removal of chest tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of the right chest tube with no appreciable
 pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are persistently low with bibasilar atelectasis
 and small right effusion.  A substantial abnormal opacification is present in
 the lower lung posteriorly on lateral view without a clear frontal correlate
 which may represent a hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval removal of right chest tube without appreciable pneumothorax.
 
 2. Substantial abnormality in the posterior lower lung on lateral view without
 clear frontal correlate.  Bilateral oblique chest radiograph is recommended
 for localization and further characterization.
