 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta
 is diffusely calcified and unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear similar with calcified mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes
 compatible with prior granulomas disease.  No pulmonary edema is present.  A
 patchy opacity is seen within the right lung base, not present on the recent
 chest CT, but similar compared to the prior chest radiograph.  Left lung
 remains clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
