                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left pneumonectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study.  There is interval expected increase in the left hemithorax effusion
 with more superior location of the air-fluid level.  Subcutaneous air on the
 left appears to be slightly decreased.  Right lung is essentially clear.  Left
 mediastinal shift appears as expected.  There has been interval removal of the
 epidural anesthesia catheter.
