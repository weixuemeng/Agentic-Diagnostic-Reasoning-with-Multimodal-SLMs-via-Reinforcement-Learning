                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumonectomy, evaluate for lung expansion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Patient is status post left pneumonectomy.  There is expected lucent left
 hemithorax and slight leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 right lung hyperinflation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette itself is stable, with
 borderline cardiomegaly.  In the right lung, no CHF, focal infiltrate, or
 effusion.  Left-sided chest tube now present.  Curvilinear density over the
 left mid thoracic spine appears to represent a spinal epidural catheter
 terminating at the level of T7 for which clinical correlation is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected left lung hyperlucency and volume loss.  Slightly
 elevated left hemidiaphragm.
