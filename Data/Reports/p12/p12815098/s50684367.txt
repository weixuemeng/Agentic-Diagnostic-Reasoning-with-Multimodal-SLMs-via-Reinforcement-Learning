                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___.
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right hilum appears lobulated and enlarged, as well as slightly
 displaced.  Additionally, there is thickening of the posterior wall of the
 bronchus intermedius on the lateral radiograph, and filling-in of the normally
 clear infrahilar region.  The mediastinum is remarkable for thickening of the
 lower right paratracheal and azygos contours.  Diffuse but asymmetrically
 distributed interstitial abnormality is present, present throughout the right
 lung and involving the left lung to a lesser degree.  It is characterized by a
 combination of reticulation and septal thickening.  Additionally, there is
 evidence of upper lobe emphysema.  Asymmetrical right apical lateral pleural
 thickening or extrapleural fat is also demonstrated.  Large retrosternal bulla
 is best visualized on lateral radiograph.  There are no pleural effusions or
 acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Right hilar and mediastinal fullness accompanied by asymmetrically distributed
 diffuse lung disease affecting the right lung more than the left.  
 
 Findings are concerning for central juxtahilar mass with metastatic lymph
 nodes and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  However, a chronic diffuse lung
 disease accompanied by reactive lymphadenopathy is an additional
 consideration.  
 
 Recommend initial further evaluation with contrast-enhanced chest CT as
 communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:30 a.m., at time of
 discovery.
