                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, status post colectomy, now with increased O2 requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The intrathoracic aorta is tortuous and there is mild widening of
 the mediastinum which is likely due to a combination of difference in
 technique compared to the prior study as well as increased mediastinal fat pad
 versus prominence of the brachiocephalic vessels.  Lung volumes are low with
 streaky bibasilar opacities particularly at the right cardiophrenic angle
 which likely represent atelectasis or vascular crowding due to low lung
 volumes, however, infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Streaky
 opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle is most likely vascular
 crowding due to low lung volumes, however, infection cannot be excluded given
 the appropriate clinical circumstance.
