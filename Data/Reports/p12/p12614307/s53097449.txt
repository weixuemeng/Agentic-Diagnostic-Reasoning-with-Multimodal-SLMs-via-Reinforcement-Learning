                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // Please check at 9am on ___-with
 CTube clamped, eval for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, inspiratory volumes
 may be minimally improved.  Left pleural effusion has mildly decreased. No
 large effusion on the right.  New, ill-defined opacity at the right lung base
 is consistent with atelectasis, possibly with a small effusion.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and
 is grossly unchanged.  There is no new focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  Left chest tube again noted, slightly different in configuration. 
 Otherwise, moderate and support devices remain in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Mildly improved left pleural effusion, small overall.  Unchanged left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 3. New basilar atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 also new.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:31 AM, 3 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
