                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CT removed  // eval for ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, multiple drains and tubes been removed. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  A right IJ central line tip is again seen near
 the SVC/RA junction.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacity consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, patchy opacity at the
 right lung base, and small bilateral effusions are also similar to the prior
 film.
 
 2 punctate radiodensities overlying the region of the left mainstem bronchus
 presumably represent postoperative changes, possibly small surgical clips.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of multiple drains and tubes.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.  Small bilateral effusions
 appear similar to the prior study.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Opacities bibasilar opacities, left more extensive than right, are again
 noted, similar to prior.
