                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and positive troponin.  Evaluate for
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  A right pectoral pacer has leads ending in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  A left port ends in the low superior vena
 cava.  There is a tracheostomy tube.  Left lower lobe linear opacities most
 likely represent atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal
 opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic knob
 is calcified.  The heart size is likely normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
