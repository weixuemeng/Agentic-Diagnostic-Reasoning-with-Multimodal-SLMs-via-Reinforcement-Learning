 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest discomfort.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a bulging contour along the
 lower mediastinum suggesting a hiatal hernia.  Streaky associated opacities
 are apparent on the lateral view which suggests coinciding atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Suspected hiatal
 hernia.
