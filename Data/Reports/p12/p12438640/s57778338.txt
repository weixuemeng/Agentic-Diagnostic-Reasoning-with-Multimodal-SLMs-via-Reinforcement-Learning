                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with concerns for aspirating this AM during
 endoscopy  // aspiration pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large area of consolidation is seen involving the left mid to lower lung and
 possibly portion of the inferior left upper lobe.  Given patient history,
 findings are concerning for mass of aspiration.  Alternatively, patient could
 have underlying infection.  The right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Multiple old left-sided
 rib fractures are seen.  Anchor screws are noted over the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large area of opacity over the left lung, predominantly involving the left mid
 to lower lung, most confluent at the left lung base ; given reported clinical
 history, findings are concerning for massive left-sided aspiration. 
 Alternatively, underlying infection could be present, less likely pulmonary
 hemorrhage.
