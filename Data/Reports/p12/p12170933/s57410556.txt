                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-cardiac surgery with COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the midline sternotomy wires
 remain intact.  Extensive pleural calcification is again seen with
 opacification in the left apex causing shift of the trachea to that side. 
 Severe chronic pulmonary changes are again noted.  No definite acute focal
 pneumonia, though this would be difficult to identify given the extensive
 pulmonary changes.
