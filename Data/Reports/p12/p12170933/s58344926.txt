                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, evaluate for presence of an
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Allowing
 for differences in technique and positioning, bilateral pleural and
 parenchymal scarring and pleural calcifications are stable. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen is a heterogeneous area
 of opacification in the mid/lower right lung, slightly decreased in density as
 compared to the prior examination and likely due to fluid within the fissure.
 Possible small right effusion. Density overlying the spine on the lateral may
 be due to loculated fluid, potentially on the left.  No pneumothorax. 
 Sternotomy wires, prosthetic aortic valve, and osseous structures are grossly
 unchanged.
