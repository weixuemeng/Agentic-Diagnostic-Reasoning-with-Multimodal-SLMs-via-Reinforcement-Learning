                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of pneumonia and prostate
 cancer, question of resolution of the pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains within normal
 limits.  No configurational abnormalities are seen.  Unremarkable appearance
 of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of
 acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in apical area on frontal
 view.  When comparison is made with the next preceding examination of ___,
 the at that time crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature at the bases
 has resolved, probably related to better inspirational effort.  Also, the
 suspected left lateral and posterior parenchymal infiltrate has cleared up and
 there are no remaining pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities present.  Similar
 as on the preceding examination, moderate degree of degenerative changes is
 seen in the thoracic spine but no evidence of vertebral body compression
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved respirational status, no evidence of remaining pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.
