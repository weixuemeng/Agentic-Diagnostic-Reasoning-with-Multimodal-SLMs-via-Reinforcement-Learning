                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage, currently intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  An
 endotracheal tube is unchanged, in appropriate position.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes are slightly decreased from the most recent prior study.  There is
 increased retrocardiac opacification compatible with left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Interval blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests
 interval development of a small left pleural effusion.  There is persistent
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
