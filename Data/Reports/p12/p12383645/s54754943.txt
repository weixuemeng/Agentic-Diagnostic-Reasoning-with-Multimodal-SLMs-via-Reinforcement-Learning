                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of right-sided
 pleuritic chest pain, nausea, sputum, decreased right-sided lung sounds on
 exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right
 middle lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right middle lobe opacity raises concern for consolidation
 due to pneumonia given the clinical symptoms.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:45 p.m. on
 ___ via telephone.
