                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of right middle lobe
 pneumonia, here for interval study, status post antibiotic treatment, evaluate
 abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly appears stable.
 Moderate enlargement of the left atrium and the pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern.  Some haze exists in the
 basal vascularity with some interstitial increased structures, all consistent
 with mild degree of chronic left-sided CHF.  Thoracic aorta has not changed in
 size and configuration and calcium deposits exist in the wall at the level of
 the arch as before.  There presently no signs of acute discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates and the on previous examination identified scattered
 patchy parenchymal densities have disappeared.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable significant cardiac enlargement with evidence of chronic
 pulmonary congestion but no evidence of acute edema or pleural effusions.  The
 on previous examinations identified suspected pneumonic infiltrates on the
 right lung base have disappeared.
