                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of throat/chest pressure,
 question pneumonia/CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The inferior aspect of the cardiac
 silhouette appears somewhat elevated from the diaphragm and there may be lung
 intervening between the inferior aspect of the heart and the diaphragms. 
 Query whether this relates to prior procedure in the interval since the prior
 study.  Most recent priors are from ___.  Comparison with more recent prior
 chest radiographs would be helpful for comparison.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Inferior cardiac silhouette appears elevated more superiorly in
 relation to the diaphragm than is typically seen, of unclear clinical
 significance, but is likely chronic and m may relate to lung parenchyma
 between the heart and diagphram.  Comparison with any prior radiographs since
 ___ would be helpful to confirm acuity.
