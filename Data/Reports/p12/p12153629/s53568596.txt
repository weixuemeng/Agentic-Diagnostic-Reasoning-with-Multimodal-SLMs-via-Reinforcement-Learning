 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  Pacemaker leads are in standard
 position.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Right lower lobe ill-defined opacities are likely atelectasis.  No
 evidence of lobar pneumonia but followup is recommended.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
