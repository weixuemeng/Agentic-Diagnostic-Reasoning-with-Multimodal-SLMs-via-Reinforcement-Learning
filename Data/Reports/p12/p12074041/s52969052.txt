                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a recent history of cardiac catheterization
 and V-fib arrest, now with an episode of chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacer/defibrillator unit projects over the left chest with a lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The heart size is mildly enlarged,
 although this may be exaggerated by AP technique.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The hilar
 contours demonstrate mild vascular engorgement.  The lungs also demonstrate
 widespread hazy opacity, compatible with pulmonary edema.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are present in the
 bilateral glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.
