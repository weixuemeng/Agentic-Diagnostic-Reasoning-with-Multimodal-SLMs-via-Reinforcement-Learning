 INDICATION:  Patient with coronary artery disease, recent VF arrest, now
 increasing delirious, underlying infection?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New mild pulmonary arteries cephalization with increased interstitial markings
 are compatible with mild interstitial edema.  Mild cardiac enlargement  is
 stable. There are bibasilar opacities that could be explained in part by small
 bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New mild interstitial edema with stable mild cardiomegaly.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities could be in part explained by small pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.  However, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 This has been verbally discussed with referring physician.
