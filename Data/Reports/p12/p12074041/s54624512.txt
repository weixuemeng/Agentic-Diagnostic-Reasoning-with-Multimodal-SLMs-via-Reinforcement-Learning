                                 FINAL REPORT
 ]PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 5:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia, fever and question infiltrate
 on left lower lobe, assess for interval progression.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 17:01.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 5:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in aeration.  No focal airspace consolidation is
 appreciated on the current examination and therefore the previously described
 abnormality likely reflected atelectasis which has resolved in the interim. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or pleural effusions. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable given relatively
 diminished lung volumes.
