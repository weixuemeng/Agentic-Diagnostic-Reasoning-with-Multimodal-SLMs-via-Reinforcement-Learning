                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, decreased breath sounds at the bases, question
 pneumonia.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution
 and patchy alveolar infiltrates.  The lateral film is limited by the arm
 projecting over the lateral lungs.  There is increased opacity at both bases
 and it is unclear if this is due to atelectasis or focal infiltrate.  The
 overall impression is that of pulmonary edema which is similar compared to the
 study from earlier the same day.
