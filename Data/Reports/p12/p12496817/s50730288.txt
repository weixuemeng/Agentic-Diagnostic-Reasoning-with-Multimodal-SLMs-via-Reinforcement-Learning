                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Suspected aspiration, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement
 with almost complete resolution of the pre-existing right basal parenchymal
 opacities.  On the left, the lung has also increased in transparency, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, but no
 other changes are detected.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
