                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain and known sigmoid perforation.  Evaluate
 preoperatively.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  The lungs are
 clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is mild rightward deviation of the trachea, which could
 be due to a thyroid lesion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No
 free air is identified below the hemidiaphragms.  Contrast material is seen
 outlining loops of bowel in the imaged upper abdomen.  Mild loss of vertebral
 body height is noted in the mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Hyperinflation, suggestive of COPD.
 3.  Deviated trachea, possibly due to a thyroid lesion; if this has not
 already been documented, recommend further evaluation with a non-emergent
 thyroid ultrasound.
