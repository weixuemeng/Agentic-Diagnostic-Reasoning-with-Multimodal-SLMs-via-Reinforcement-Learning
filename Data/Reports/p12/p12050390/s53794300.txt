                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, hx of pulm fibrosis  // Please eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ outside hospital PA and lateral chest radiographs
 ___ outside hospital chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right upper lobe mass is unchanged in appearance.  Peripheral and
 basal predominant interstitial markings are similar compared to the prior
 examination.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  A right-sided dual chamber
 pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The superior-most median sternotomy wire is fractured, unchanged. 
 Mediastinal clips and an aortic valve replacement are also noted.  Mild
 anterior wedging at multiple levels in the upper thoracic spine is unchanged
 compared to the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right upper lobe mass and pulmonary fibrosis are similar compared to
 approximately 2.5 weeks prior.  No definite focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
