                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute onset respiratory distress,
 intubated for CT scan  // ET tube placement, NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The newly placed endotracheal tube ends approximately
 3 cm from the carina, and the neck appears to be flexed.  Newly placed enteric
 tube traverses the diaphragm and the tip and side-port project over the left
 upper quadrant in a nondistended stomach.  The right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is
 intact and unchanged in position, ending in the approximate region of the
 right upper atrium.
 Lung volumes remain low with bilateral atelectasis, improved on the right. 
 Interval improvement in right pleural effusion.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess given technique and lower lung volumes, but grossly appears similar the
 prior exam.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ETT in standard position.  Interval improvement in right atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.
