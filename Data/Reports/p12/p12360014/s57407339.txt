                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ileostomy takedown with new shortness of
 breath  // please evalute for respiratory process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates the very low lung
 volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased
 density at the right lung base, which is consistent with lobar collapse and
 probable small pleural effusion.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is
 difficult given the low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath ends in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Increased density in the right base is consistent with lobar
 collapse and probable small pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ By Dr. ___
 ___ telephone at 10:34 on ___, at the time of discovery.
