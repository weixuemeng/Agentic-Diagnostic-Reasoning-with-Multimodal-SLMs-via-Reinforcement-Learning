                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o female w/ rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma s/p robotic assisted
 LAR w/ diverting loop ileostomy (___) s/p ileostomy takedown on ___.
 Transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 539
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is an right sided indwelling catheter with tip at SVC/RA junction
 an NG tube, with tip and side-port curled in the expected location of the
 gastric fundus.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, similar to 1 day earlier.  Triangular
 opacity at the left base medially, with new obscuration of the medial left
 hemidiaphragm, could reflect some superimposed atelectasis.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes and
 patchy atelectasis at the right lung base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is not well delineated due to low inspiratory volumes.  Prominence of the
 right hilar  region probably reflects part of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, accentuated by low lung volumes and differences in rotation.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  New triangular
 opacity at the left base medially may reflect some superimposed segmental
 atelectasis.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for further
 assessment.
 2. No pneumothorax detected.
 3. Mild vascular plethora is similar to the prior film and likely accentuated
 by low lung volumes.  No gross effusions.
