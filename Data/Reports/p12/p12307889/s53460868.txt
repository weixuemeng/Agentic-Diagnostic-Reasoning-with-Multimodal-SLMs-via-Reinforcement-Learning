                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and upper back pain, rule out acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and likely CABG.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions as well as vague
 right lower lobe opacity, probably due to atelectasis.  A mild interstitial
 abnormality mostly involves the lowre lungs and may be due to slight
 congestion or airway inflation.  Mild bilateral pleural thickening is greater
 on the right left, possibly fluid, extrapleural fat or fibrous tissue.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small suspected bilateral pleural effusions.  Right basilar
 opacity, probably atelectasis.  Mild non-specific interstitial abnormality.
