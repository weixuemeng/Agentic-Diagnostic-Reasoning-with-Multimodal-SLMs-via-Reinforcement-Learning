                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma  // Assess Rlung
 for worsening pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, a large right pleural effusion
 has apparently increased size, and there is likely a substantial hydro
 pneumothorax component at the apex, less well demonstrated due to apparent
 semi upright rather than fully upright positioning on this radiograph.  Right
 lung is densely consolidated and partially atelectatic.  Left pigtail pleural
 catheter remains in place in the lower left hemi thorax with a persistent
 small left apical pneumothorax and small left pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is accompanied by mild to moderate edema.  Worsening left
 lower lobe consolidation is also demonstrated.  No other relevant changes.
