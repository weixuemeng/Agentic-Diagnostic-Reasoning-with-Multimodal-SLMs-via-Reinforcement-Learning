                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea hypoxia  // r/o effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in well large amount opacity projecting over
 the right hemi thorax with only small amount of aeration seen in the right
 upper region, possibly due to worsening pleural effusion, consolidation and
 underlying atelectasis.  There has also been interval increase and left base
 opacity, likely combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, possibly
 consolidation.  The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is obscured. 
 Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of pulmonary opacities with near complete opacification of
 the right hemi thorax with a small amount of aeration in the right upper lung.
 New/increased left base opacity, may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion, consolidation, and atelectasis.
