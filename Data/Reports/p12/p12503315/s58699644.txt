                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent effusion s/p pleurodesis.  //
 ?effusion, ?removal of catheter.      ?effusion, ?removal of catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion has begun to reaccumulate since ___ following
 removal of the large right thoracostomy tube ; a smaller right pleural drain
 remains in place.  .  Small left pleural effusion is stable or slightly
 increased.  Since the mediastinum remains midline, the volume of new pleural
 fluid is matched by equivalent volume loss in the severely consolidated right
 lung.  It is also possible that the mediastinum is fixed in position, since
 fullness in the right lower paratracheal station suggests adenopathy.
