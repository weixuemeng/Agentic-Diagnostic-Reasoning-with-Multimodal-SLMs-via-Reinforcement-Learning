                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic cancer // Assess right lung and
 chest tubes and concern for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___ at 1518h.
 CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A pigtail catheter projects over the right mid upper hemithorax and another
 projects over the left lower hemithorax, unchanged in position overall.  Tiny
 right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension has perhaps decreased in
 size, but is not larger and has been replaced in part by fluid.  Large right
 pleural effusion with severe atelectasis has decreased since yesterday but is
 still substantial.  The heart size cannot be adequately assessed, but is
 probably moderately enlarged and overall unchanged.  No appreciable left
 pleural effusion. Lung volumes remain low.  No left pneumothorax.  Interval
 decrease in left edema.  The possibility of lymphangitic spread cannot be
 excluded given the clinical history. Prominence of the right hilar region may
 reflect lymphadenopathy given history of metastatic cancer and recent CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but improved large right pleural effusion and small right
 pneumothorax and left edema vs lymphangitic spread.
