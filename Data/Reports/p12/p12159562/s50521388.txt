 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tissue AVR, evaluate for hemothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed earlier on the same day at 4:24 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube has been advanced in the interim and the tip now is 6.8
 cm above the carina at the thoracic inlet.  The right IJ approach Swan-Ganz
 catheter is likely situated at the main pulmonary artery.  Remaining support
 and monitoring devices including bilateral chest tubes, enteric tube, and a
 mediastinal drainage catheter are unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are
 again noted.
 
 There has been interval increased collapse at the left lung base with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and volume loss.  The right lung is
 essentially clear. No large pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Tip of the ET tube now situated 6.8 cm above the carina at the thoracic
 inlet.
 
 2.  Right IJ approach Swan-Ganz catheter likely at the main pulmonary artery.
