                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weight loss
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms. There is also
 biapical, right greater than left, scarring. Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles may relate to hyperinflated lungs although trace pleural
 effusions are difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs and biapical scarring suggest COPD. Slight blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles may relate to hyperinflation although trace
 pleural effusion is difficult to entirely exclude.  CT is more sensitive in
 detecting small intrathoracic lesions.
