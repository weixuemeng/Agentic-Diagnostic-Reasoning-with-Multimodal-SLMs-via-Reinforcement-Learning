                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with left-sided pneumothorax status post placement of
 pigtail catheter. Evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph performed
 approximately 2 hr prior to thi exam and prior to the placement of the pigtail
 catheter.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the previous exam there has been interval placement of a pigtail
 catheter which ends in a paramediastinal location in the left mid lung region.
 There has been interval resolution of the previously seen pneumothorax. Severe
 left lower lobe atelectasis persists. The right lung is hypoinflated,
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding but without focal opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval resolution of left-sided pneumothorax after placement of a
 pigtail catheter.
 
 2.  Persistent severe left lower lobe atelectasis.
