                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with three weeks of cough, rhonchi on
 examination, right more than left, assess for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The patient has a history of previous
 bypass surgery.  Sternal wires had to be removed related to necrotic processes
 in the sternum requiring removal of manubrium.  Multiple surgical clips can
 still be identified in the anterior mediastinum and along the anterior
 left-sided chest wall.  There is very mild cardiac enlargement postoperatively
 and apparently unchanged in comparison with the next previous available
 examination of ___.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested
 and there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary infiltrate.  Very mild
 blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses is present, seen on the frontal views,
 but apparently unchanged since ___.  The lateral pleural sinuses are free. 
 One can, however, identify a few linear and patchy infiltrates in the left
 lower lung base, lateral and posteriorly, which are slightly more prominent
 than they were ___ years ago.  It is impossible to decide whether they
 represent scar formations or to some degree represent infectious processes. 
 It is recommended to treat the patient for the ongoing infection and schedule
 him for a followup examination in about two to three weeks.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly unchanged chest findings.  probably old scar formations,
 possibly with some subtle new infiltrates on the left base.  Followup
 examination after two to three weeks is recommended.
