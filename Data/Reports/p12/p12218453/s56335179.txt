                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia, to assess for clearing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, chronic changes are again
 seen at the left base with atelectasis and fibrosis.  The possible area of
 patchy opacification at the right base appears to have substantially cleared.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
