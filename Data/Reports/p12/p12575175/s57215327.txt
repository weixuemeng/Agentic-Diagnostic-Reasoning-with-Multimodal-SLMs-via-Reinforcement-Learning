                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Bacteremia, hypotension, and IVF boluses; assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are lower lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side,
 could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be totally
 excluded.  The small bilateral pleural effusions are new or newly appeared.  A
 moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
