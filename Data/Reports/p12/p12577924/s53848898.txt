                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough in the right upper quadrant.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Left lower lobe linear opacities
 are consistent with areas of atelectasis and unlikely to represent infectious
 process.  No other abnormalities within the lungs demonstrated worrisome for
 infectious process as well.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  
 
 
 Hiatal hernia, small, noted.
