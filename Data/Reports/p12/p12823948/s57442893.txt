  Left ___- and infrahilar airspace opacity, worrisome for pneumonia. Recommend
  followup to resolution to exclude underlying mass. Prominence of the left
  hilum, more conspicuous as compared to the prior study, could relate to
  underlying lymphadenopathy.
  
  Subtle increase in interstitial markings bilaterally could be due to mild
  underlying interstitial edema although atypical infection is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is prominent right apical scarring, chronic, with elevation of the
 hila. . The patient is status post right clavicular surgery. There is left
 perihilar airspace opacity worrisome for pneumonia. Recommend followup to
 resolution to exclude underlying mass. Subtle increase in interstitial
 markings bilaterally could be due to mild underlying interstitial edema
 although atypical infection is not excluded. There is also prominence of the
 left hilum, also seen on the prior study but slightly more conspicuous today ;
 underlying lymphadenopathy may be present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. The lungs are hyperinflated. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to
 mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left ___- and infrahilar airspace opacity, worrisome for pneumonia. Recommend
 followup to resolution to exclude underlying mass. Prominence of the left
 hilum, more conspicuous as compared to the prior study, could relate to
 underlying lymphadenopathy.
 
 Subtle increase in interstitial markings bilaterally could be due to mild
 underlying interstitial edema although atypical infection is not excluded.
