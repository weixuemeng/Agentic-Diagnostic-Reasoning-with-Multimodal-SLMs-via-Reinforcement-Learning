                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation and nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip is at the level of
 the thoracic inlet, terminating approximately 8.3 cm from the carina.  The
 nasogastric tube tip is within the stomach.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes
 with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in standard positions. Low
 lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
