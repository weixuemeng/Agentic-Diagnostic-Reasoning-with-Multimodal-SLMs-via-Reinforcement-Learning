                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, medistinal chest tube removed.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, causing
 apparent worsening of the bibasilar atelectasis.  The nasogastric tube and
 mediastinal chest tube have been removed.  The lucent contour surrounding the
 right mediastinal contour is no longer present and no evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is bibasilar atelectasis and fluid in the right minor fissure.
 There is post-operative cardiomediastinal widening similar to prior
 post-operative radiographs.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 More prominent peribronchial cuffing suggests mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Lungs are otherwise clear.
 
 The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed but the introducer sheath
 remains in place.  The remainder of the indwelling support and monitoring
 devices remain in standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pneumothorax no longer visualized after removal of mediastinal
 chest tube.
 2.  Lower lung volumes with unchanged bilateral small pleural effusions and
 basilar atelectasis left worse than right.
 3.  Minimal worsening of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
