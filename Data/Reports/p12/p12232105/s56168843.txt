  a dedicated lateral view may be helpful in the exclusion of pneumonia.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acidemia in the setting of AMS  // ?acute
 intrapulmonary process      ?acute intrapulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are bibasilar opacifications
 most likely representing atelectasis, though a lateral view, if possible,
 could be helpful if there is clinical concern for superimposed pneumonia. 
 Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
 Prominence of the superior mediastinum on the right is consistent with known
 thyroid mass seen well on previous CT scans.
