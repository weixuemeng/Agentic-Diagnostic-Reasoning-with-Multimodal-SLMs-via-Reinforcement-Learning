                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pancytopenia and possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is a dense retrocardiac
 opacity with air bronchograms, suggesting pneumonia.  There are also more
 patchy streaky right basilar opacities.  In addition, central pulmonary
 arteries are mildly prominent with upper zone redistribution, suggestive of
 mild fluid overload.  Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is mild
 leftward convex curvature centered along the mid lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe, worrisome for
 pneumonia.
