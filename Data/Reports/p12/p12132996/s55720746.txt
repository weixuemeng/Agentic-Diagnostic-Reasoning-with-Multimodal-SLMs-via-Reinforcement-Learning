                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status and neutropenia who
 presents for evaluation for new pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left-sided PICC terminates in the mid upper-to-mid SVC.  There
 appears to be an interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions;
 however, some of these changes could be secondary to positioning.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  The heart borders are obscured by the pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions.  Superimposed
 infectious etiology cannot be excluded given the extent of the effusions.
 Lateral view would be helpful if possible. 
 
 2.  Stable right tracheal impression consistent with a right thyroid mass,
 unchanged compared to prior exams dating back to ___.
