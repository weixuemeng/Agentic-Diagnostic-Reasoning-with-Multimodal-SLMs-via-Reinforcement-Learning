  Increasing retrocardiac opacity is likely related to a moderate-to-large left
  pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. A superimposed infection cannot
  be excluded, though no definite focal consolidation is identified. The
  remainder the exam is unchanged.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute pancreatitis, new fever spikes, susp
 retrocardiac opacity  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. 
 There is an increasing amount of left pleural effusion, combined to an area of
 basal left-sided atelectasis. Minimal platelike atelectasis at the right lung
 base. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema. No
 pneumothorax. The position of the left-sided PICC line is constant.
