 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure  //
 interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 06:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 04:00 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right internal jugular central line,
 right subclavian dual lumen catheter are likely unchanged in position. 
 Interval decrease in lung volumes with worsening patchy opacities throughout
 both lungs, left lower lobe greater than other lobes, with associated layering
 effusions, left greater than right. Findings would be concerning for worsening
 pulmonary edema but a worsening infectious process such as pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered as the airspace process is more focal in
 the left lower lung. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax.
