                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock, intubated  // interval
 change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  The opacity in the left mid and lower lung zones has
 substantially decreased, although there is still poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Little
 overall change on the right. Again, this most likely represents some
 improvement in pulmonary edema, though superimposed pneumonia would again have
 to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
