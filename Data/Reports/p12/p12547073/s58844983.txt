                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/o RLL wedge resection, right chest tube
 removed, assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___ at 10:20. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There has been interval removal
 of the right chest tube. Patient is undergone prior right lower lobe wedge
 resection. Skin ___ along the right lateral chest wall noted. Midline
 sternotomy wires and a prosthetic cardiac valve are again noted. There is no
 pneumothorax. Blunting of the right CP angle with thickening along the right
 lateral pleura could represent loculated effusion. There is scattered poorly
 defined opacity within the right lung which has been seen on prior exams and
 is concerning for infection vs atelectasis. There is mild left basilar
 atelectasis and possible tiny left pleural effusion. The heart size is
 difficult to assess but appears grossly unchanged. The mediastinal contour
 appears stable. The bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Interval removal of right chest tube without pneumothorax.  Probable
 loculated right pleural effusion with extensive opacity in the right lung
 concerning for pneumonia vs atelectasis.
 2. Probable atelectasis and small effusion at the left lung base.
