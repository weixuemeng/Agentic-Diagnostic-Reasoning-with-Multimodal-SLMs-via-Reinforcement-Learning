                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, low-grade temperature and history of COPD on home
 oxygen.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 ___.  
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Sternotomy wires, right axillary
 clips and a mitral valve prosthesis are constant.  Asymmetry of the right
 chest wall, likely from prior mastectomy.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with a history of COPD.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.  A vague opacity projecting over the spine, seen
 only on the lateral view, is new from prior.  The heart size is normal and
 there is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  A hiatal hernia is unchanged in
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view is
 likely atelectasis or confluence of shadows, however, pneumonia is also a
 possibility.  If further clarification is needed, oblique views would be
 useful.
 
 Attempt to page these findings to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 13:15 on ___ were unsuccessful.  As such, findings were placed on the critical
 results dashboard.
