 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are
 postoperative changes on the right. The chest tube is in place and there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Continued opacification at the left base
 consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
