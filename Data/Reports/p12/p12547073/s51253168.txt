 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, worsening cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, neither the frontal nor the
 lateral film shows substantial changes.  The lung volumes are mildly
 increased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, there is
 unchanged evidence of valvular replacement as well as of a small left basal
 plate-like atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or masses.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
