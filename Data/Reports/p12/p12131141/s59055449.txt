                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation, here to evaluate for ET tube placement and
 pulmonary pathology.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ at 23:47 and 13:42 and ___.  
 
 Technique:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating just below the
 thoracic inlet 3 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  The patient is slightly
 rotated.  The inspiratory lung volumes remain low.  No significant focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is slightly indistinct, suggesting interval mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  A calcified granuloma is re- demonstrated in the right
 lung base and right lung apex.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contours are slightly prominent related to unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube and NG tube in appropriate position.  
 
 2. Interval development of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
