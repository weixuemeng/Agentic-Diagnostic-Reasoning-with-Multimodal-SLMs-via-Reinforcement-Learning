                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Clearing consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Left
 basilar consolidation is again seen with an area of opacification overlying
 the heart consistent with a lingular process.  In view of the lack of total
 clearing, CT could be obtained to evaluate whether there is an obstructing
 process in the bronchial tree.
