                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent admission for pneumonia.  Evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and
 the left basilar pneumonia has improved, but not cleared.  The lingular is
 still opacified and has an irregular margin on the frontal view.  The
 appearance on the lateral view is not charachteristic of a fat pad.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving left basilar pneumonia.  However, it has not completely
 cleared and persistent opacity in the lingula warrants short follow-up chest
 radiographs in six weeks.  If the consolidation has not cleared at that time,
 CT is recommended.
 
 Findings and recommendations were submitted to the radiology system for
 communication to the ordering physician.
