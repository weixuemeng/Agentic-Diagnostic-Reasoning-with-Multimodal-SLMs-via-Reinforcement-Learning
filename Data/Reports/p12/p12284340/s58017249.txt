                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, now status post
 tracheostomy, on antibiotics for pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, dual-chamber pacemaker and a left PICC line are in
 satisfactory position.  Enteric tube terminates in the distal esophagus and
 should be advanced by at least 10 cm for better positioning beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.Lungs are again hyperinflated with bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left.  Opacification of the retrocardiac region
 represents left lower lobe atelectasis.  Increased opacification of the right
 lung base may represent developing pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Malpositioned enteric tube should be advanced approximately 10 cm for
 better positioning beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
 2.  Layering bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 3.  Increasing opacification of the right lung base concerning for developing
 pneumonia.
