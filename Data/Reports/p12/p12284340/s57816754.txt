  Little interval change in the appearance of the chest.  Hazy opacity in the
  right lower lobe again seen and likely representing a layering effusion. 
  There is also blunting of the left costophrenic angle which also likely
  represents a small left pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is grossly
  stable.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Tracheostomy and pacer
  leads are unchanged.
