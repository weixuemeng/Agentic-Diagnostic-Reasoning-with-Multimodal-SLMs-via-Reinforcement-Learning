                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p resection AAA  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, overall appearance of the chest
 is relatively similar except for a new poorly defined right basilar opacity,
 likely due to a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion. 
 Followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
