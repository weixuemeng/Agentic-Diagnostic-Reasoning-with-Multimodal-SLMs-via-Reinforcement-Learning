                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain status post liver biopsy, evaluate for
 free air.
 
 Technique :
 
 Single AP erect portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.  There are relatively
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, however, likely exaggerated by AP
 technique and low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
