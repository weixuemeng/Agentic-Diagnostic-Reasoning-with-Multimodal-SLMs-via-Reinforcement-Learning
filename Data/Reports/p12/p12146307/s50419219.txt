                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:20 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman recovering from urosepsis and kidney stone.  New
 fever.  Suspect pneumonia or aspiration, based on previous chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are very low, suggesting that the mild degree of heterogeneous
 opacification at both lung bases is combination of atelectasis and small
 effusions.  Although pneumonia is not excluded, that diagnosis does not need
 to be invoked to explain the findings.  Upper lungs are entirely clear and the
 heart is normal size.
