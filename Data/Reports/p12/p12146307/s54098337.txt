                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and ___ as well as
 chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Although assessment is limited due to leftward rotation of the patient, there
 is appearance of a bilateral hilar engorgement, more prominent in the right,
 with bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening and perihilar opacities.  There
 might be a small right-sided pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 present.  The sternotomy wires are intact and mediastinal clips are unchanged
 in location.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest vascular congestion, bibasilar atelectasis and
 possible trace pleural effusions.  Prominence of the right hilum could be due
 to vascular engorgement, however, dedicated PA and lateral views would be
 helpful for further evaluation.  Recommend follow-up to exclude underlying
 lymphadenopathy.
