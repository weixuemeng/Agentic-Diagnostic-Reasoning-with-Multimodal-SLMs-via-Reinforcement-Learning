                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia. Evaluate for aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated and the patient is partially rotated. Heterogeneous
 bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, however could represent
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. Prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette and pulmonary vasculature is likely secondary to technique. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Remote fractures of the right clavicle, right lateral and left ___ posterior
 ribs are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasal opacities may reflect atelectasis and or aspiration. Radiographic
 followup with PA and lateral radiographs at an optimal inspiratory level are
 recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  fractures
