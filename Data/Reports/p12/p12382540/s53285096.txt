                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hyperviscosity syndrome who has increased
 SOB  // ___ year old man with hyperviscosity syndrome who has increased SOB
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest x-ray from___ dated ___,
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided catheter is present. It probably overlies the mid/ distal SVC.
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD. There is probable mild
 cardiomegaly. The mediastinum is slightly prominent, with convexity in the AP
 window, consistent with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The hila are not
 obviously enlarged. There are increased interstitial markings diffusely, with
 peribronchial cuffing and thickening of the minor fissure. There is only
 slight upper zone redistribution. A lateral view shows very small posterior
 pleural effusions. There are patchy bibasilar opacities more pronounced on the
 left.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Somewhat atypical course to the right sided line, though it is probably
 overlies the SVC. Clinical correlation requested. No pneumothorax detected .
 2. Probable background COPD.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly. Findings consistent with known mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.
 4. Diffusely increased interstitial markings. This does not necessarily relate
 to CHF and, depending on the clinical setting, other causes of diffusely
 increased interstitial markings should be considered.
 5. Patchy bibasilar opacities, which may reflect collapse and/or
 consolidation, but should also be considered in the full clinical context.
 6. Aside from placement of the catheter, no definite change compared with
 outside film from ___
