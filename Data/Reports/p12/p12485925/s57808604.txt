                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CKD and cystic fibrosis, with new
 initiation of hemodialysis.  Study requested for evaluation of lungs prior to
 hemodialysis and to rule out pulmonary infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right hemodialyisis catheter ends in the right atrium.  There is
 widespread abnormality in the lungs, consisting mostly of subcentimeter
 nodules and interstitial linear opacities extending from upper to lower lungs,
 but worse in the lower. There are punctate hilar calcifications but no nodal
 or hilar vascular enlargement.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Widespread nodular and linear opacities, worse in lower lungs with
 associated hilar nodal calcifications, not typical of cystic fibrosis.  These
 findings raise the possibility of active infection, malignancy or sarcoidosis.
