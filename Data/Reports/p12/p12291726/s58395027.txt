                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, congestion and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Areas of
 reticular scarring projecting over the right upper lobe and left upper-to-mid
 lung are similar in distribution as compared to the prior study in this
 patient with reported history of sarcoidosis.  No definite new areas of focal
 consolidation are seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Again seen areas of chronic
 lung changes bilaterally, as above and mild prominence of the hila compatible
 with patient's known history of sarcoidosis.  No definite new focal
 consolidation.
