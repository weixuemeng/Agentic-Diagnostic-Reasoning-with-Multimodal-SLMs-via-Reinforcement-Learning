                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low.  There
 is a subtle opacity in the right lung base.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart size is stable and
 top normal.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right base may represent pulmonary vascular
 crowding due to low lung volumes.  In the right clinical setting, an early
 pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded.
