                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath.  History of asthma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild interstitial prominence with peribronchial cuffing,
 which could be seen with airway inflammation, among other etiologies. 
 Although interstitial opacities are more confluent in the right lower lung and
 elsewhere, this appearance is unchanged since the earlier examination and is,
 accordingly, of uncertain significance.  Small osteophytes are noted along the
 mid thoracic spine.
