                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Severe diastolic congestive heart failure, influenza
 and bilateral pleural effusions, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval improvement of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion and lower lung consolidations are
 unchanged.  Left small pleural effusion is redemonstrated.  Apical opacity on
 the right might be consistent with infectious process as well.
