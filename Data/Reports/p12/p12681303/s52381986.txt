                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year woman with shortness of breath, dyspnea insertion with new
 confusion and disorientation with elevated bicarb by labs.  Evaluate for small
 pleural effusions and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient in
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously noted mild pulmonary edema has improved, but a large right pleural
 effusion has apparently increased in size with adjacent right middle and lower
 lobe lung opacification.  A small left pleural effusion is also seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with calcification of the
 aortic knob again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Resolving pulmonary edema.  Increased large right pleural effusion, with
 adjacent right middle and lower lobe opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis with or without coexisting pneumonia.
