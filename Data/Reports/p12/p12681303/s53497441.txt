                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, shortness of breath and oxygen
 desaturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a persistent moderate size right pleural effusion with slight
 interval increase in size of a small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged, with calcification of the aortic knob
 again seen.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar size moderate right pleural effusion with interval increase in size of
 a small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
