 Bilateral perihilar opacities are most consistent with pulmonary edema and a
 left pleural effusion persists.  There is also mild blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may in part be due to overlying soft tissue, but
 trace right pleural effusion is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The osseous structures are not well evaluated.

 Pulmonary edema and left pleural effusion.  Persistent enlargement of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
