 AP CHEST, 8:57 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea, cough and hypoxia.  Suspect
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, with basal predominance has improved
 slightly since ___.  Apparent severity of edema is increased by
 persistent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis.
 Mediastinal adenopathy documented on ___ chest accounts for much of
 the mediastinal widening.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Of note, relative enlargement of the right
 heart suggests elevated pulmonary artery pressure, even though the main
 pulmonary artery is not dilated.
