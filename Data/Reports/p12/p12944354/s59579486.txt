  Limited examination due to signficant patient rotation.  Bibasilar opacities,
  R>L, with morphology suggestive of atelectasis though pneumonia not excluded.
  Consider f/u PA and lateral film when pt able - for further characterization.
  No edema, no large effusions, no pneumothorax. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Basal areas of atelectasis.  Low lung volumes but no evidence of
 focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Previously
 placed right upper quadrant drain has been removed in the interval.
