                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, cough.  Assess for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are patchy ill-defined opacities in lung bases worrisome for
 infection or aspiration.  Emphysematous changes of the upper lobes are again
 noted.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The heart
 is normal in size.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for diffuse
 demineralization and loss of vertebral body height, unchanged since prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Possible bibasilar infection or aspiration.
 
 2. Emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
