                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the left and somewhat oblique in position.  On the
 lateral view the patient's arm overlies the upper chest.  The above limits
 evaluation.  Given this, rounded retrocardiac opacity may be due to hiatal
 hernia.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings re- demonstrated bilaterally,
 likely due to chronic lung disease.  Left base opacity is worrisome for
 infection or/and aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study.  Left base opacity worrisome for infection and/ or aspiration
 superimposed on chronic lung disease.
