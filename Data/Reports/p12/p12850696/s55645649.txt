                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with atypical chest pain, cough.  Evaluate for
 infectious process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Breast shadow
 projects over both lung bases.  Despite this limitation, the lungs are clear. 
 There is no nodule, consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal. The right posterior sulcus is blunted.  Both
 costo-phrenic angles are sharp.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right posterior sulcus blunting could represent a tiny effusion
 or scaring.
