                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cadiac arrest status post left IJ
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left IJ central venous catheter which
 terminates in the superior cavoatrial junction. The pre-existing right IJ
 terminates in the right atrium. The ET tube is correctly positioned 4.7 cm
 above the carina. An enteric tube is partially visualized with the tip
 coursing out of the field of view of this exam.
 
 There has been interval improvement in the atelectasis at the left lung base
 as well as bilateral perihilar opacities which probably reflects a combination
 of pulmonary edema and resolving atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is
 stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Included upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left IJ central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 2.  Interval improvement of left basilar atelectasis as well as bilateral
 perihilar opacities which reflects a combination of pulmonary edema and
 resolving atelectasis.
