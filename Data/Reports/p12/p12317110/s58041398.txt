 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with seizure s/p cardiac arrest with diffuse
 hypoxic injury on brain MRI and consistent fevers  // evaluate for interval
 changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the
 clavicles. A right IJ central venous catheter likely enters the right atrium.
 A nasogastric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm into the stomach, distal
 tip not visualized. There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac airspace opacity
 corresponding to either atelectasis or aspiration is unchanged. The right lung
 remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the left basilar retrocardiac airspace
 opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
