                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast cancer s/p resection and chemo now
 admitted with CHF ___ heart block and s/p Left sided pacemaker. Also being
 treated for CAP.  // please eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___ and prior
 chest CT dated ___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The diffuse interstitial opacities are worsening compared with the prior study
 of ___, likely representing progressive interstitial edema. A
 developing opacity at the left costophrenic angle was not present on the prior
 study of ___, and may be atelectasis, but superimposed infection
 cannot be ruled out.  The attention is recommended on subsequent followup
 imaging.  Surgical clips in the reconstructed right breast are unchanged. The
 dual chamber left chest wall pacemaker leads are in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased diffuse interstitial opacities, which likely representing
 progressive interstitial edema.
 2. Focal consolidation in the anteromedial segment of left lower lobe, which
 may represent pneumonia considering history of ongoing treatment of pneumonia.
