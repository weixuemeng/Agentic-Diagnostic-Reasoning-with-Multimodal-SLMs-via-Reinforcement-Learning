                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with DOE  // CHF exacerbation?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior x-ray, there is more conspicuous opacity at the right
 lung base medially with a more rounded configuration on the frontal views. 
 Increased less well the found surrounding opacity is also noted at the right
 lung base as well.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Biapical
 scarring is again noted.  The left lung is otherwise clear.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Right chest wall dual
 lead pacing device is again noted.  Mid thoracic compression deformity is
 unchanged from prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of opacity at the right lung base potentially in part due to post
 obstructive atelectasis given known increasing infrahilar soft tissue on prior
 CT scan.  Superimposed infection would be possible.  More rounded nodule at
 the right lung base could represent a pulmonary nodule.  Followup will be
 necessary.
