                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacer device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Patient is status post transcatheter aortic valve
 replacement.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. 
 The aorta remains tortuous, and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally suggests underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension, unchanged.  There is continued right hilar
 enlargement compatible with underlying mass lesion, with worsening streaky
 right basilar opacity likely reflecting a combination of mucous plugging and
 collapse of the right lung base, but superimposed infection is not excluded. 
 Within the lung apices, there is a similar appearance of scarring with
 bronchiectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Patient is
 status post right mastectomy with clips projecting over the right lower chest
 wall.  Loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  Chronic
 left lateral rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of right hilar enlargement compatible with underlying mass
 with worsening streaky right basilar opacification likely reflecting a
 combination of mucous plugging and atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
 Unchanged scarring within the apices bilaterally.
