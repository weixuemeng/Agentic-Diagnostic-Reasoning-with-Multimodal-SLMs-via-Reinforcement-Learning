                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___. Torso
 CTA ___.
 
 ___ PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Diffuse interstitial opacity is stable compared to
 the prior study and is compatible with post-radiation and fibrotic changesv
 likely related to NSIP, better seen on prior chest CT from ___. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Clips are noted within the right breast.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant in
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No significant interval change
 from the prior exam, with diffuse interstitial opacity corresponding to
 post-radiation and fibrotic changes likely related to NSIP.
