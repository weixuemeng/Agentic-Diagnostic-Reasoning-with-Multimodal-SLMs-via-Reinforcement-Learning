                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // Assessment of OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___ at
 05:10.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An OG tube is better visualized on the current study, coursing through the
 stomach.  ETT is in standard position.  Since the most recent prior study,
 there may be slight improvement in the heterogeneous opacities at the lung
 bases, which is more consistent with resolving edema rather than aspiration. 
 There is no evidence for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  OG tube in standard position.
 2.  Improving bibasilar opacities, most consistent with resolving edema.
