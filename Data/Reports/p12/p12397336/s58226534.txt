 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pressure, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for left ventricular configuration
 of the heart.  The descending aorta is mildly tortuous.  Bilateral shoulder
 chondrocalcinosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
