                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Post-op, worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is a small amount of residual free air under the hemidiaphragm, likely
 post-operative.  New right lower lobe opacity is worrisome for aspiration. 
 There is minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated suggesting the presence of COPD.  Cardiac size is normal.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small.
