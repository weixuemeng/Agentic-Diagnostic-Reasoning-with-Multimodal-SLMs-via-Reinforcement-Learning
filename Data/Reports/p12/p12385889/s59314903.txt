 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well inflated and clear bilaterally with no evidence of
 masses, lesions, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Hila are unremarkable with no evidence of
 adenopathy.  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  No osseous abnormalities are

 radiographically occult on plain film. If there is sufficient clinical
 concern, CT of the chest is recommended for better assessment of possible
 infection.
