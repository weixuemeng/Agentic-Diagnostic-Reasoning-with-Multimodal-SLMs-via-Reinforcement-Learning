                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of bone marrow transplant, recent
 influenza and persistent cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower now than they were on any earlier studies, particularly
 compared to ___.  Given lower lung volumes, I do not think there has
 been any progression of the subtle multifocal infection that was present on
 the chest CT scan ___ but barely appreciated on the conventional
 chest radiograph the preceding day.  If the intent of obtaining chest
 radiographs now is to document clearing of these previous findings, then CT
 scanning would be necessary.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement. 
 The convex lateral contour of the mediastinum in the region of the ascending
 thoracic aorta is due to tortuosity, neither aneurysm nor adenopathy.
