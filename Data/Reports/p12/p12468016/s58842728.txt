                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMHx notable for Crohn's disease (not on
 treatment as non-compliant), COPD (gold stage IV, on 3.5L NC at baseline),
 recurrent C. diff, HTN, HLD, history of DVTs on A/C, and dCHF, who presents
 with abdominal pain and BRBPR from rehab, course c/b aspiration PNA, with NG
 tube pulled out  // eval for NG
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for
 assessment of a nasogastric tube, which courses below the diaphragm.  Due to
 image artifact, the distal tip of the nasogastric tube is not confidently
 visualized.  Repeat radiograph of the upper abdomen may be helpful in this
 regard.
