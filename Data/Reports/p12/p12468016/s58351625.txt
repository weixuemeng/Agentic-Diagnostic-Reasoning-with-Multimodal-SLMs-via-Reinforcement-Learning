                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, increased O2 need  // ? pulm edema vs.
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung bases are relatively underpenetrated on the frontal view due to
 patient body habitus.  Given this, prominence of the hila suggests pulmonary
 vascular engorgement/ mild congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky
 basilar opacities are seen, left greater than right, which are most likely due
 to atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
