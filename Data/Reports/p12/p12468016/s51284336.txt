                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and worsening dyspnea  // evaluate for
 infiltrate or worsening edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Multiple EKG leads overlie the right lower chest.  Allowing for this, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Also again seen is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region which
 could represent either focal atelectasis or a pneumonic infiltrate.  The
 appearance is not significantly changed compared with ___ or ___.  Subsegmental atelectasis left lung base has increased.
 
 Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle is unchanged.  The left
 costophrenic sulcus is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF, similar to prior.
 
 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region is grossly unchanged.  Differential
 includes atelectasis or focal infiltrate.
 
 New subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.  The possibility of an early
 infiltrate at the left base would be difficult to exclude.
 
 No gross effusion.  Minimal blunting right costophrenic angle.
