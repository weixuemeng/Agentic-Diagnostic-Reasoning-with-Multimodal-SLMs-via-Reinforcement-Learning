 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung bases are underpenetrated likely due to patient body habitus. Given this,
 no definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Indistinct and engorged pulmonary vessels, as seen on the prior
 study, suggests some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
