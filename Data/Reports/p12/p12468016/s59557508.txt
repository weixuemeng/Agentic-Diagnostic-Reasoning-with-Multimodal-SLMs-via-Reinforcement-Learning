 INDICATION:  ___M with Gold Stage IV COPD, CHF on home O2 recent admission for
 COPD exacerbation given azithro no respiratory improvement, tachycardic,
 crohn's dz
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated
 consistent with history of COPD.  Streaky lower lung opacities most compatible
 with atelectasis though difficult to exclude a subtle pneumonia.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Stable
 hilar prominence suggesting pulmonary hypertension.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Streaky lower lung opacities likely reflect atelectasis though difficult to
 exclude pneumonia.
 2. COPD with hilar prominence suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
