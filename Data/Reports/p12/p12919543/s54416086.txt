                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F polytrauma rest driv p/w ___ ___ w small mediastinal
 hematoma,manub/clav ___,___ R ant ___, L 3 rib ___, L foot 2,3,___ MT ___,open R
 wrist ___, s/p ORIF of R distal radial ___ c/b PE and L DVT  s/p right chest
 tube placement.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Lung volumes remain low bilaterally.  The
 right chest tube projects over the right mid to lower hemithorax with its tip
 projecting over the right mediastinum.  Slight widening of the mediastinum may
 be projectional but is not changed if not minimally decreased.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  Left moderate pleural effusion is overall unchanged. 
 Atelectasis at the right lung base is also overall unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Prominence of pulmonary vasculature is likely secondary to
 crowding from low lung volumes but is overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change - persistent moderate left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with the ACS
 team on the telephone on ___ at 10:30 AM.
