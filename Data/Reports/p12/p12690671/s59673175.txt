 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, though the side port
 is probably above the esophagogastric junction.  There is suggestion of some
 perihilar opacification on the left.  In view of the clinical history, this
 could possibly be an area of developing consolidation.
