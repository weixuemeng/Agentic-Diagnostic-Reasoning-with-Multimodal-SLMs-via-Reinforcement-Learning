                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Compared to the prior radiograph from
 ___, there are new bibasilar opacities which could reflect
 pneumonia or aspiration in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  Atelectasis
 is also a possible explanation for the basilar opacities.  No upper lobe
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or
 large pleural effusions are evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New bibasilar opacities may reflect aspiration or pneumonia, though
 atelectasis is also possible.
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly
