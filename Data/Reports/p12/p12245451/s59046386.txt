                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are stable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated in both lung
 bases, right more so than left, which could reflect atelectasis but infection
 cannot be excluded, particularly in the right lung base.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.
