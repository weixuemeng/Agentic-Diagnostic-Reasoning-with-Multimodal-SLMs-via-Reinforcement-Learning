                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and right flank pain, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Bibasilar
 opacities may represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal with a tortuous
 aorta.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes; however, infection cannot be excluded.
