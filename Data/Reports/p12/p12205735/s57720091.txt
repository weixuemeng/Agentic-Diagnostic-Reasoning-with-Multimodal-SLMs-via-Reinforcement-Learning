                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DVTs, trached for spine fx, increasing
 tachycardia, mildly febrile, aspiration event yesterday.  // Evolution of
 infiltrate?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear decreased in size, and there is no
 definite pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Worsening
 confluent opacities in the perihilar and basilar regions, possibly due to
 reported history of aspiration event superimposed upon pre-existing areas of
 lower lobe atelectasis and or consolidation. Free intraperitoneal air is noted
 within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, possibly due to recent
 gastrostomy tube placement, but clinical correlation suggested to exclude the
 possibility of a perforated abdominal viscus.  Widespread posttraumatic
 deformities have been more fully evaluated by cross-sectional imaging.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 8:20 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
