 Moderate cardiomegaly is larger, mild interstitial edema persists.  Following
 tracheal extubation, left lower lobe consolidation has worsened appreciably,
 could be atelectasis alone.  Less severe right basal atelectasis is unchanged.
 Left perihilar consolidation could be either residual of edema and atelectasis
 or early pneumonia and should be followed closely.

 pericardial effusion.
