 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ?pna septic  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is bibasilar atelectasis
 versus aspiration.  An area of consolidation in the left lower lobe is
 associated with volume loss and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and is
 concerning for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. The right-sided
 internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis versus aspiration.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 3. An area of consolidation in the left lower lobe is associated with volume
 loss and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and is concerning for pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Impression point 3 was discussed with Dr.  ___ By Dr. ___
 ___ telephone at 10:19am on ___, approximately 2 hours after discovery.
