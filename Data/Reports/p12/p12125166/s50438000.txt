 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 1 hour earlier.
 
 Four images are available, the first two show still the NG tube coiled in the
 esophagus, the last image shows an NG tube that passes the diaphragm to the
 stomach and is out of view.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs
 are grossly clear.  Right PICC is in unchanged position in the lower SVC.
