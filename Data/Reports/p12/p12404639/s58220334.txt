                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Left lower lung streaky
 opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lingular atelectasis or pneumonia. If the clinical findings do
 not conform to pneumonia CT scanning would be indicated to detect an
 endobronchial bleeding source. Dr ___ notified by email.
