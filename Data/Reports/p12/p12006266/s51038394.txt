                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and a torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Not feeling well with low O2 saturation, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 exam, there is interval increase in the left pleural effusion.  A small right
 pleural effusion is redemonstrated.  Bibasilar consolidations are likely
 attributable to compressive atelectasis.  Overall, heart and mediastinal
 contours appear stable.  Degenerative changes at the right shoulder are
 redemonstrated.  Degenerative changes in the T-spine also again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left effusion.  Persistent smaller right effusion. 
 Compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
