                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question edema.  The patient presents with increased lower extremity
 edema and history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is similar mild unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 As before, the minor fissure appears slightly thickened.  Depicted on the
 lateral view is a moderate subpulmonic effusion with associated opacity,
 probably due to atelectasis, likely unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Right-sided rib deformities appear unchanged.  Moderate anterior osteophytes
 are noted throughout the thoracic spine.  The right shoulder demonstrates
 severe degenerative changes including complete effacement of the glenohumeral
 joint with subchondral sclerosis and prominent marginal osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate right-sided pleural effusion; otherwise
 unremarkable.
