 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with lymphoma, pericardial effusion and recurrent
 pleural effusions with pigtail catheter bilaterally.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies CT ___ and chest x-ray ___.
 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusions; if any, there is a small right
 pleural effusion.  Bilateral basal pigtail catheters are in place in unchanged
 position.  ET tube is seen in standard position.  NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Right lower lobe opacities have
 markedly increased.  This could be due to reexpansion pulmonary edema, but
 aspiration is a possibility.  Left lower lobe increasing opacities could be
 due to increasing atelectasis,and or reexpansion pulmonary edema.  Patient has
 known mass in the anterior mediastinum,
