 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4.5 cm
 above the carina.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflecting atelectasis in
 the setting of somewhat diminished lung volumes.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Apparent blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be
 projectional as no pleural effusion was present on the recent chest CT.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.
