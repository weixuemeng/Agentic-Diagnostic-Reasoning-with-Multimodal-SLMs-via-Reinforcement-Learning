                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with postoperative respiratory
 distress and fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest views were obtained with this morbidly obese
 patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next
 preceding portable semi-erect chest examination of the preceding day; ___.  Grossly, heart shadow and mediastinal structures appear unchanged
 and there is no evidence of new sizable parenchymal infiltrates in the lung
 fields seen on the frontal view.  On both frontal and lateral views the
 prominent soft tissue structures impair visibility of the lung bases and the
 diaphragms can barely be identified.  Gross outlines of the diaphragms in the
 lateral view, however, question the presence of any significant pleural
 effusion as at least one posterior pleural sinus can be identified.  There is
 no pneumothorax in the apical area as identified on the frontal view. 
 Radiographic observations of pulmonary congestion which would be the
 consequence of fluid overload cannot be made with certainty on this
 examination.
