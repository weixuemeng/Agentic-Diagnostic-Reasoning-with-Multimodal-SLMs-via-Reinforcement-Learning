                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with unwitnessed fall.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, accentuating perihilar vascular congestion and crowding.  The heart
 is normal in size.  Post-CABG changes and median sternotomy wires are present.
 The thoracic aorta is tortuous with arch calcifications.  Retrocardiac opacity
 likely represents atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Thoracic kyphosis is unchanged.  Right shoulder severe
 deformity is chronic.  Pronounced left shoulder osteoarthritis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings suggesting mild perihilar vascular congestion.
 2.  Left basilar opacity likely reflecting atelectasis; however, if there is
 persistent evidence of or concern for infection based on clinical grounds,
 then short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered.
