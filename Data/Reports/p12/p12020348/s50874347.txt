 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  History of coronary artery
 disease and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post endotracheal intubation.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach; its tip is not imaged, however.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  There are new perihilar opacities suggesting
 pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms appears
 unchanged, and although not entirely specific as the etiology, could be seen
 with substantial atelectasis.  Mild relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is similar to somewhat increased.  A trace left-sided pleural
 effusion is suspected.  There is no pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips
 project over the right upper quadrant.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  New perihilar opacities
 suggesting pulmonary edema.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity, which could
 reflect atelectasis, although an infectious cause cannot be excluded.
