                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post intubation, question line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is striking interval increase in airspace opacity within the
 right greater than left lung.  Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage,
 asymmetric edema, or aspiration.  A right IJ catheter is in place with its tip
 in the lower SVC.  An endotracheal tube is in place with its tip 3 cm from the
 carina.  An NG tube tip and side hole are within the stomach.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinal contours remain normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked interval increase in airspace opacity, right greater than
 left.  Consider aspiration, hemorrhage or less likely asymmetric edema as
 etiology.
