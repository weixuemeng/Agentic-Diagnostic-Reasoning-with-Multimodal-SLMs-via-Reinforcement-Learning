                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:09
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 4:34.
 
 Single portable supine chest film dated ___ at 5:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.7 cm above the carina.  A right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing to the level of the diaphragm but cannot be followed more distally
 due to underpenetration at the bases.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable.  The diffuse bilateral airspace process, more confluent on the
 right than the left, has not significantly changed ___ at 4:34 a.m.,
 but has improved since ___ at 5:23.  These findings suggest either
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or improving aspiration pneumonia or hemorrhage. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.
