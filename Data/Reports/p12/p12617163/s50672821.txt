 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Right PICC has been removed.  Clip projecting over the
 right suprahilar region is re- demonstrated.  Minimal streaky opacity in the
 left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
