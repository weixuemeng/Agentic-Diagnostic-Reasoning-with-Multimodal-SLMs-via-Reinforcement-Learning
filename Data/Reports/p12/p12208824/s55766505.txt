                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia, assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs appear
 clear bilaterally aside from mild basilar plate-like atelectasis.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature which
 is compatible with known severe underlying emphysema.  Comparison was also
 made with a prior CT chest from ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema without superimposed pneumonia.
