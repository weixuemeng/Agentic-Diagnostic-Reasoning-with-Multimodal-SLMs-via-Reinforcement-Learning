                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia, dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms
 compatible with emphysema, as seen on the prior chest CT.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities likely   are reflective of atelectasis.  Faint ill-defined
 micronodular pattern is seen diffusely, and may relate to a smoking related
 chronic interstitial lung disease as noted on the prior chest CT.  No mass or
 focal consolidation is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2. Emphysema.
 
 3. Diffuse fine micronodular pattern, better assessed on the prior chest CT,
 and suggestive of a smoking related interstitial lung disease.
