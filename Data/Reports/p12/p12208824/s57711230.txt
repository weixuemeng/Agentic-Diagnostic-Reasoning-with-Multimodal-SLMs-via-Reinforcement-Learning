                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left sided weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal sillhouette and
 hilar contour are unremarkable.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged from
 prior study.  Increased reticular nodular markings bilaterally appear similar
 to prior examination and better evaluated on prior CT examination.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are grossly
 unremarkable.  There is mild hyperinflation and diaphragm flattening,
 suggestive of emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 2.  Emphysema.
 3.  Unchanged diffuse reticular nodular pattern better visualized on prior
 chest CT, suggestive of smoking-related interstitial disease.
