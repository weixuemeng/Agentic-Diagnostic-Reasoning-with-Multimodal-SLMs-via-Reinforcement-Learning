                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs and
 emphysematous changes. Patchy bibasilar hazy opacities are noted most
 pronounced within the right lower lung zone. Heart size is within normal
 limits. Mediastinal and hilar silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. No overt
 pulmonary edema, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with hazy bibasilar, right greater than left, opacity may
 reflect aspiration, less likely pneumonia though this cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
