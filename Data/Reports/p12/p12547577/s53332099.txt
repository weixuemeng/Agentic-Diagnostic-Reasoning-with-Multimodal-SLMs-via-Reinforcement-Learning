                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and patchy
 opacification at the left base, but decreased, whereas other portions of the
 lungs appear clear.  However, the left diaphragm is somewhat elevated which
 may indicate some atelectasis or mild gastric distension, noting new gastric
 air-fluid levels.  There is probably a small pleural effusion on the left,
 noting posterior costophrenic blunting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving left basilar opacification.  New gastric air-fluid
 levels with mild distension.
