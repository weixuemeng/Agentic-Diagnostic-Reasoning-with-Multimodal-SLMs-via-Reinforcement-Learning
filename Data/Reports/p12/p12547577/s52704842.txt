                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique and positioning.  There
 is a focal opacity in the right lower lobe, obscuring the posterior right
 hemidiaphgram and better depicted on the laterl view.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the right lower lobe, worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Atelectasis or aspiration could also be considered.  Short-term radiographic
 followup is suggested.
