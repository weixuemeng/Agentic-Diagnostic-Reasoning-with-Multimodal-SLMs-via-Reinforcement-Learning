  likely projectional in nature.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hpoxia.  Assess for fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval progression of moderate to severe pulmonary edema with
 persistent moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are again noted.  Previously identified
 retrocardiac hyperdensity is no longer visualized and was likely projectional
 in nature.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Progression of moderate to severe pulmonary edema with persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 2. Previously identified retrocardiac hyperdensity is no longer visualized due
 to parenchymal abnormality.  Recommend repeat frontal and lateral radiograph
 once lungs are clear for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend repeat frontal and lateral radiograph once lungs
 clear for further evaluation of the retrocardiac nodular opacity seen on prior
 study.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 9:12 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
