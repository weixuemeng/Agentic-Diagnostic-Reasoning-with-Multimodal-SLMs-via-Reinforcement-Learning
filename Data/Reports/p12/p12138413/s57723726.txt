  1.  Mild pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly.
  2.  Rounded 1.8 cm dense retrocardiac opacity may represent a partially
  calcified lymph node or pulmonary nodule. Differential includes focal
  pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Comparison with prior films
  would be helpful and if not available consider repeat frontal and lateral
  chest radiograph 6 weeks after resolution of symptoms.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob.  Assess for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal peribronchial cuffing with mild perihilar opacities and mild
 cardiomegaly is most consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  A rounded 1.8 cm
 dense retrocardiac opacity is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Aortic arch calcifications are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly.
 2.  Rounded 1.8 cm dense retrocardiac opacity may represent a partially
 calcified lymph node or pulmonary nodule. Differential includes focal
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Comparison with prior films
 would be helpful and if not available consider repeat frontal and lateral
 chest radiograph 6 weeks after resolution of symptoms.
