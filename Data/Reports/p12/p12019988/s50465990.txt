 INDICATION:  ___M with left sided chest pain  // eval for pneumothorax or
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally.  Rounded
 opacity in the right hilar region is probably a vessel on end.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle may reflect pleural thickening.  There is no large
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable left pleural thickening.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 Rounded opacity in the right hilar region is probably a vessel on-end. 
 Consider repeat chest radiograph to confirm.
