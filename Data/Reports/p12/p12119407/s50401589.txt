                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of HIV, hepatitis C, with
 fever, weakness, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left base
 patchy is worrisome for infection.  There is additional focus of rounded
 opacity projecting over the posterior left seventh rib which may relate to
 what appears to be a prior fracture at that site most likely, although
 infection involvement is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
