                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status after unwitnessed fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.6 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube tip is within the proximal stomach, although the side port is
 just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.  Heart size is borderline
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Cephalization of
 pulmonary markings suggest mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency in attenuation of pulmonary vascular
 markings suggestive of underlying COPD and emphysema.  Patchy atelectasis is
 noted in lung bases without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly identified.  No displaced fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube tip is within the proximal stomach, however side port is
 proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.  The enteric tube should be
 advanced by approximately 10 cm for optimal positioning.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 4. Bibasilar atelectasis.  COPD/emphysema.
