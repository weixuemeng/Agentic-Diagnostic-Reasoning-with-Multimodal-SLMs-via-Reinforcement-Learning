                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and
 congestive heart failure, now with loose tooth that may have been aspirated or
 swallowed.  Evaluate for tooth.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from eight hours
 earlier and radiographs from ___.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube, right central venous catheter, left-sided AICD,
 and a feeding tube, which appear unchanged in position.  There is extensive
 cardiomegaly and there are diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally.  Opacities
 are more confluent in the left base and right upper lobe.  The right upper
 lobe area appears better aerated since the previous study.  There are no
 densities projecting over the bronchi to suggest an aspirated tooth.  There is
 no free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
