                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left sided dual-chamber AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, compatible with cardiomegaly and a
 moderate to large pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 relatively unchanged.  There is a new focal opacity within the right upper
 lung field.  Additionally there is mild pulmonary edema, with small bilateral
 pleural effusions, slightly progressed in the interval.  Assessment of the
 lung apices is limited due to obscuration by the patient's chin.  No large
 pneumothorax is identified but assessment is limited.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Focal opacity within the right upper lung field likely reflects pneumonia
 though asymmetric pulmonary edema may have a similar appearance.   
 
 2. There is a background of mild pulmonary edema which appear slightly
 progressed compared to the prior study with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 
 3. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is compatible with a combination of
 cardiomegaly and moderate to large pericardial effusion.
