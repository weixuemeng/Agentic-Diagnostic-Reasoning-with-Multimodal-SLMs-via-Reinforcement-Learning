 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status*** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // Evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to patient's overlapping arm.Given this, no
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited lateral view due to patient's overlapping arm, however, no focal
 consolidation seen to suggest pneumonia.
