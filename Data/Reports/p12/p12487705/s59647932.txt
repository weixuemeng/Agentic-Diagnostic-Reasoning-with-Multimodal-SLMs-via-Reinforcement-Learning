                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  GPC bacteremia and new hypoxia.  Assess for septic emboli versus
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unchanged exam
 with unremarkable cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Stable linear
 opacifications noted in the bilateral lung bases, left greater than right,
 likely representing atelectasis.  Stable blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may represent small effusion versus atelectasis.  Lungs are clear
 without evidence of septic emboli or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible small left pleural effusion,
 unchanged from prior.  No evidence of pneumonia.
