                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AAA, followup edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray at 18:42 p.m.
 
 Various lines and tubes appear grossly unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably also unchanged.  Allowing for technical differences,
 CHF findings, bibasilar atelectasis, and ? small bilateral effusions are
 similar.  Rotated positioning again noted --  this obscures delineation of the
 right hilum.
