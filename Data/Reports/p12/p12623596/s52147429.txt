                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A subtle tiny
 opacity in the right lung base could represent a very early pneumonic
 consolidation.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle small opacity in the right lower lung is concerning for an
 early pneumonia.
