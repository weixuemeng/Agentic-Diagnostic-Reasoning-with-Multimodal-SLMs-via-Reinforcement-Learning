 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  The ventilation of the
 right upper lobe has improved.  The pleural effusions are seen on the lateral
 radiograph only and are limited to the posterior aspects of the costophrenic
 sinuses.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Unchanged
 alignment of the sternal wires.
