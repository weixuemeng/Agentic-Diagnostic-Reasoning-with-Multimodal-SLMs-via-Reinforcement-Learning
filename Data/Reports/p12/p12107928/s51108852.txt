                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dementia and worsening confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged and probably even larger than on the
 earlier comparison study, protruding more posterior, suggesting marked left
 atrial enlargement.  Opacification in the left lower hemithorax suggests a
 pleural effusion with associated parenchymal opacity, but decreased.  A trace
 pleural effusion is suspected on the right.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly.  Small to moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion with associated opacity, likely atelectasis; overall decreased,
 although an infectious process is hard to entirely exclude.
