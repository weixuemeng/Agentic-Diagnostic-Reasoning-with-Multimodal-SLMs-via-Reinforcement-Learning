                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with vomiting.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volume are low. There are bilateral diffuse interstitial
 opacities, with associated hilar indistinctness and vascular upper
 re-distribution.  Foci of more patchy opacities are seen in the right lower
 lobe. Chronic elecvation of left hemidiaphragm with left basilar opacity is
 also seen.  Severe cardiomegaly is not significantly changed from prior. There
 might be small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Severe
 degenerative changes of both shoulders are present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with acute pulmonary edema on the background
 of severe cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may represent superimposed
 atelectasis versus infection.
