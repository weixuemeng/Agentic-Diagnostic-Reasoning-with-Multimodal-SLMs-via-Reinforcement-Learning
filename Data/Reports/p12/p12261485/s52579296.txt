                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent SDH, now with Dobhoff placement evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 We have three AP views.  In the first view, the Dobhoff tube is recurving on
 itself, probably in the left bronchi and then returning up, ending in the
 lower neck region.  In the second view, the Dobhoff is projecting at the
 gastroesophageal junction.In the last exam, the Dobhoff tube is in in the
 gastric antrum.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The right jugular line is in
 adequate position.  There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  The
 mediastinum is widened.  This is partly due to thoracic aorta dilatation as
 shown in the CT of the C-spine of ___.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  The Dobhoff tube is projecting in the gastric antrum.
 2.  The widened mediastinum is partly explained by a thoracic aortic
 dilatation.
