                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cirrhosis, presented
 with acute kidney  and total volume overload, assessment of the PICC
 placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly stable.  New right lower lung opacity might reflect
 interval development of atelectasis, although infectious process is a
 possibility given the lack of recent prior studies and should be further
 followed.  Mild vascular engorgement is seen, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 present.
