                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a Dobbhoff tube
 in place with the opaque tip in the antral region.  Right subclavian catheter
 again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
 
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, most likely related to
 pulmonary edema.  The focal opacification at the right base is not as apparent
 on the previous study.
