                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after exploratory
 laparotomy due to small-bowel obstruction with large-volume fluid
 resuscitation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely in the stomach.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unchanged including top normal heart.  There is
 interval development of vascular engorgement that might be consistent with
 interstitial edema.  In addition, there are most likely present bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Right lower lobe opacity although might potentially be
 related to pulmonary edema can reflect atelectasis or infectious process and
 should be closely followed to exclude the possibility of active process.
