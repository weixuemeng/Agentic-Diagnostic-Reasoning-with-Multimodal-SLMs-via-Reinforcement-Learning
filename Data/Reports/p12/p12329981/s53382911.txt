                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease, status post transplant with hepatic artery
 stenosis, presenting with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  The aortic arch is
 partly calcified.  The lung volumes are low.  There are patchy opacities at
 both lung bases, probably more extensive on the left; these could be seen with
 atelectasis, which was also visualized on recent prior CT imaging from ___ in association with pleural effusions.  Subpulmonic pleural effusions
 may persist; at least on the left, a persistent effusion is implied by
 haziness in the left costophrenic sulcus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities; although an
 infectious etiology is hard to entirely exclude, these are suspected to
 reflect atelectasis associated with small subpulmonic effusions, as
 demonstrated previously.
