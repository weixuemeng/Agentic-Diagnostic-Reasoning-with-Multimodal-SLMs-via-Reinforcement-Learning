                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Persistent cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Increasing
 homogeneous opacity in right lower lung probably represent a combination of
 moderate pleural effusion, atelectasis and dependent edema, but attention to
 this region on followup film would be helpful to exclude a developing area of
 pneumonia.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis and left pleural effusion are
 unchanged allowing for incomplete imaging of the cardiophrenic sulcus region.
