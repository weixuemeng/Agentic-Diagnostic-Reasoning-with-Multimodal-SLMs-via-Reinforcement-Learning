                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 3.6 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm overlying
 left upper quadrant.  
 
 There is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring,
 and a small left effusion.  There is patchy opacity at both bases, consistent
 with collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 23:30 p.m., the ET and NG tube are new.  A small left
 effusion is slightly more prominent.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
