                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with re-positioning of endotracheal tube
 and placement of OG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been advanced slightly and is now 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  There is a new nasogastric tube whose side port is just
 below the GE junction.  This could be advanced a few centimeters for more
 optimal placement.  The right IJ and right subclavian central line tips are
 again seen within the mid SVC, stable.  There is stable atelectasis at the
 right base and bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity
 which are unchanged.
