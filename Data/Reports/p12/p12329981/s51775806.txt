                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest  radiograph ___.  Chest
 ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff is seen within the stomach.  It is not in the
 post-pyloric position.  A right subclavian hemodialysis catheter ends in the
 mid SVC.  A left PICC ends at least in the low SVC, although the tip is
 difficult to visualize.  A linear opacity at the right base is unchanged and
 likely represents chronic atelectasis.  Atelectasis at the left base is
 stable.  There are no new consolidations.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
