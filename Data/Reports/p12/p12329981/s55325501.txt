                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OLT.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Bilateral hazy opacification is consistent
 with layering effusions and volume loss at both bases.  Indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
