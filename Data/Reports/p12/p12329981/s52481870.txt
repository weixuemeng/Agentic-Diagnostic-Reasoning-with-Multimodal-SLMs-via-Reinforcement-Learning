 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:50 AM
  Air-fluid level under the right hemidiaphgram, question air/fluid collection
  vs free air vs possible transposition of the colon superior to the liver
  although this was not seen on prior studies.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever status post recent liver
 transplant.  Please rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  In the right middle lobe, there continues
 to be an opacity, similar to the earlier chest x-ray and likely atelectasis. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Under the right diaphragm, there is an ir-fluid level seen;
 question air/fluid collection vs free air vs possible transposition of the
 colon in front of the liver although this was not seen on prior studies. A
 Dobbhoff tube is once again seen with its tip in the stomach.  There is
 blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle and a small pleural effusion
 may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Continued opacity in the right middle lobe, likely atelectasis.
 2. Air-fluid level under the right hemidiaphgram, question air/fluid
 collection vs transposition of the colon superior to liver (although this was
 not seen on prior studies) vs free air. CT scan pending.
 3. Blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle, a small pleural effusion
 may be present.
