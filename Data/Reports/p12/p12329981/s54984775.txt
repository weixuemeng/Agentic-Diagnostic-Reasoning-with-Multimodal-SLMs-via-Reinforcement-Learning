 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT 04:45
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver transplant, here for respiratory

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 14:13.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in
 position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  There are bilateral layering effusions with patchy airspace
 process at both bases, essentially without significant interval change.  In
 addition, the pulmonary vasculature appears less well defined on current
 examination, likely reflecting superimposed pulmonary and interstitial edema. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  No pneumothorax. 
 Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.
