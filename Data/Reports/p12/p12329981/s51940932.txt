                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right-sided pleural effusion and status post
 right colectomy, liver transplant, and splenectomy.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the endogastric tube.  The left
 central line tip sits at the left brachiocephalic vein while the right central
 line tip sits in the upper SVC.  The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal but is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Additionally, bibasilar opacities are somewhat worsened with no clear
 delineation of the costophrenic angles.  These findings are compatible with
 small bilateral pleural effusions with associated worsening atelectasis at
 both bases.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
