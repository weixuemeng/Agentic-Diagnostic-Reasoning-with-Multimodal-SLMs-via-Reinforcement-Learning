                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cirrhosis, needs p.o.
 for CT.  Evaluate for nasogastric tube placement in the stomach.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 06:47.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal views of the chest are obtained.  There is interval
 placement of a weighted nasogastric tube, which courses below the diaphragm,
 terminating in the expected location of the stomach.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right base streaky opacity most likely
 represents chronic atelectasis as has been seen on multiple priors.  Mild left
 base atelectasis is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm persists; again possible air-fluid
 collection vs interposition of bowel vs free air. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a weighted nasogastric tube, coursing below
 the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach.
 
 
 Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm persists; again possible air-fluid
 collection vs interposition of bowel(although not see on studies prior to this
 date) vs free air.
