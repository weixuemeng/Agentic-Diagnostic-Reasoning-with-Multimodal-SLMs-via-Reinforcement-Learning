 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post thoracentesis with left effusion.

 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right central venous catheter and left
 PICC are all in unchanged positions.  Large right pleural effusion and
 atelectasis are unchanged.  Left pleural effusion is decreased with improved
 basal aeration with perhaps mild reexpansion of pulmonary edema, but no
 pneumothorax.  Heart remains mildly enlarged with a bibasilar atelectasis.
