                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Incompatible liver transplant with low-grade fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is persistent
 opacification at the bases.  Although most likely reflecting atelectasis and
 effusion, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  No definite pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube opaque tip begins at approximately the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The tube should be pushed forward several cm if
 possible.
