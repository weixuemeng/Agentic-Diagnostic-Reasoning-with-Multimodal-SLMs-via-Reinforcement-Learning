                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, assess for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities
 are likely minimal atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no
 pleural abnormalities.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal aside
 from unchanged mild tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are again seen.  No rib fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  No evidence of a rib fracture. Imaging evaluation of the chest cage would
 require detail views of locations of point tenderness.
