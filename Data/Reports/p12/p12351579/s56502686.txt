                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with leukocytosis and cough for ___ weeks,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  There is subtle increased retrocardiac opacification anterior to
 the spine, which may represent atelectasis; however, very early consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle increased opacification on the lateral view posterior to the heart and
 anterior to the spine likely represents atelectasis; however, very early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
