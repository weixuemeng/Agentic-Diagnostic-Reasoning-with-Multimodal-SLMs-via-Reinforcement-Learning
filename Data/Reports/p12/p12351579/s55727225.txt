                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pain in the right posterior back.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are hyperinflated. 
 The hemidiaphragms are flattened consistent with COPD.  Opacities in the
 lingula could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
 totally excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Minimal reticular
 opacities in the subpleural region in the right upper lobe are more
 conspicuous than before, they could be part of the COPD.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate degenerative changes are in the
 thoracic spine.
