                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with prolonged hospital stay, now with
 cough/congestion and new crackles on lung exam; pna vs atelectasis  // rule
 out pna     rule out pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:34
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lungs appear mildly hyperinflated with subtle parenchymal peripheral
 interstitial changes suggestive of emphysema. If the patient has a smoking
 history, screening with chest CT should be considered. No airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The aorta is somewhat unfolded and
 tortuous.  Slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery raising the
 possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Prominent
 degenerative changes involving the thoracic spine as well as the costochondral
 junctions.  Prior rotator cuff tear on the right and probable chronic rotator
 tear tear on the left with associated degenerative changes.
