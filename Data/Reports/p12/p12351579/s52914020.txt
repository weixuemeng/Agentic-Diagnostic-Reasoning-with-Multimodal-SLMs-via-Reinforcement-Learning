 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Smoking history, weight loss, rule out malignancy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Multiple very subtle and non-characteristic scars in the lung
 parenchyma, notably in the periphery of the lung suggest the presence of mild,
 potentially smoking-related interstitial changes.  However, no severe
 overinflation is present and no nodules or mass lesions are visualized.  Known
 history of right shoulder surgery.
 
 Given the limitations in resolution of interstitial structures of the chest
 radiograph, CT should be considered to establish a morphologic baseline, that
 of a smoking history.
