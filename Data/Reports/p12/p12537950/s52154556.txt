 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever, right upper lobe pneumonia.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in
 severity of the pre-existing right upper lobe pneumonia.  The pneumonia also
 shows minimally more air bronchograms than on the previous image.  No newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.  On today's image, the radiograph reveals
 small bilateral dorsal pleural effusions that are restricted to the dorsal
 parts of the costophrenic sinuses.
 
 Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  The right PICC line has been minimally pulled back.
