                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 9:55
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question acute leukemia.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at 9:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left-sided pacer remains in place, although both lesions are not
 completely visualized on the current study.  Lungs are low in volume with some
 crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but there is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusions, focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There
 is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature likely related to the low lung
 volumes.
