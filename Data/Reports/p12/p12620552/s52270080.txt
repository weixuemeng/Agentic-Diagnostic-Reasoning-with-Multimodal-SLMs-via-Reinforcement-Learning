                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bilateral pleural effusion.  Status post
 right thoracentesis.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement
 in previously seen right lung base opacity.  There is persistence of a right
 mid lung opacification which could represent an infectious process in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is bilateral pulmonary edema which is
 unchanged since the prior study.  Right PICC line is unchanged in position.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in right lung base opacification consistent
 with recent thoracentesis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right mid lung
 opacification persists and pulmonary edema is unchanged since the prior study.
