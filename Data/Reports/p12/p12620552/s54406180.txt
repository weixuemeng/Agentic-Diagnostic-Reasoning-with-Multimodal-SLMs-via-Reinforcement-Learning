                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with CLL and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, now
 with increased oxygen requirement.  Assess for pulmonary edema or effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of
 bilateral pulmonary edema with increased opacification in the right lung base
 which may represent infectious component.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The previously seen right PICC line and dual-lead pacemaker are
 unchanged in position since the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval worsening of bilateral pulmonary edema.  Right lung base
 opacification may represent an infectious process in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
