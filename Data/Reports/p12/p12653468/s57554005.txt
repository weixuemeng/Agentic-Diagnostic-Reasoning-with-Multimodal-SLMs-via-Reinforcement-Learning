 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, evaluate for pleural
 effusions, mediastinal widening.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 7:47.
 
 Portable chest film ___ at 13:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar chest tube remains in place.  Interval removal of the right
 internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter.  Lung volumes remain low with small
 bilateral layering effusions and patchy bibasilar opacities, most likely
 reflecting patchy atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Crowding of
 vasculature in the setting of low lung volumes.  Left upper lateral pleural
 opacity likely represents a component of loculated fluid does not present on
 the preoperative study.  There may be a tiny left apical pneumothorax.  No
 large pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged in this postoperative patient,
 status post median sternotomy for CABG.
