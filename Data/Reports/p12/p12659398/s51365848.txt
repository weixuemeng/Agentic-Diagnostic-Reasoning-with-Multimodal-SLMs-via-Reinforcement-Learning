                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hemoptysis, recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison, reference
 made to outside hospital chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 relatively wedge-shaped opacity in the peripheral right middle lobe which
 correlates to area of pulmonary infarct seen on recent prior CT.  There is
 also a small right pleural effusion.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral right middle lobe opacity corresponds to pulmonary
 infarct seen on recent prior CT in this patient with pulmonary embolism. 
 Small right pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.
