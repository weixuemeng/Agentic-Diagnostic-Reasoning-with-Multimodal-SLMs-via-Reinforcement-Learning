                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with Crohn's disease flare and severe ileus,
 evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal plain films performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no intraperitoneal free air.  Opacity within the right CP
 angle likely reflects atelectasis and a small pleural effusion.  There is
 faint retrocardiac opacity. The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiac silhouette
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 gaseous distention of the stomach and left colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No intraperitoneal free air.
 2.  Right CP angle and retrocardiac airspace opacity, likely reflects
 atelectasis and small right pleural effusion, although in the appropriate
 clinical setting pneumonia is not excluded.
