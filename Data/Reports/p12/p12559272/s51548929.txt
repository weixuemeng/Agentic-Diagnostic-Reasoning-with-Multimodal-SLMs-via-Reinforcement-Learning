                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax as a potential cause of the
 patient's right-sided chest pain.  A chest tube has been removed from the left
 hemithorax, and a questionable basilar hydropneumothorax is present on this
 side.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities have worsened and are likely due to
 atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly increased compared to
 the prior study, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of right pneumothorax as a potential cause of pleuritic chest
 pain.
 2.  Possible small left basilar hydropneumothorax following left pigtail
 pleural catheter removal.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation accompanied by pleural
 effusions.
