                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of bilateral pleural effusions, reassessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion has slightly decreased, but the pre-existing left pleural
 effusion has slightly increased in extent.  The areas of bilateral subsequent
 atelectasis follow the distribution of the effusions.  The observation is
 confirmed by the lateral radiograph.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has
 slightly decreased.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The well ventilated lung
 parenchyma is unremarkable.
 
 Right PICC line in unchanged position.
