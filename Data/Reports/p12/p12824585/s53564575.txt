                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea and increased rales on
 left side.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  As observed on preceding examination,
 patient's accentuated kyphosis in the chest and anterior flexion of neck
 obscures markedly the apical areas of the lung on the frontal view.  No
 significant interval change can be identified and pneumothorax in the area is
 unlikely.  As before, there exists cardiac enlargement without typical
 configurational abnormality and the thoracic aorta is widened and elongated. 
 No local contour abnormalities are identified.  A permanent pacer in left
 anterior axillary position is again seen and demonstrates unchanged position
 of two intracavitary electrodes terminating in locations compatible with right
 atrial appendage and right ventricular apical portion correspondingly.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No new acute infiltrates are seen. 
 Mild blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus is still present and
 unchanged and indicates scar formation rather than pleural effusion.  The
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  No new acute infiltrates can be seen. 
 The, on previous examination, identified left-sided rib injuries are again
 seen and have not changed in appearance.  No increase of the, at that time,
 suspected pleural density has occurred.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with a moderate cardiomegaly but absence of
 acute infiltrates or acute pulmonary congestion.  No significant interval
 change can be identified between the next preceding examination of ___
 and today's examination.
