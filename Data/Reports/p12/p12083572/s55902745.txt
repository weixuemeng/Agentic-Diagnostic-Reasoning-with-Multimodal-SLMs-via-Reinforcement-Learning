                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dry cough for two months.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Left upper lobe
 collapse is due to a large lobulated left hilar mass obstructing the upper
 lobe bronchus.  Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe is a strong
 indication of contralateral mediastinal adenopathy, also involving the left
 lower paratracheal station and aortopulmonic window.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is due in part to atelectasis but is severe enough to suggest
 phrenic nerve impingement by central tumor. Apparent thickening of the left
 lung apical pleural margin is actually due to upper lobe atelectasis above the
 elevated major fissure.  Pleural surfaces are normal. Heart size is not
 enlarged. Right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchial obstruction by large, presumably malignant, left hilar
 mass responsible for left upper lobe collapse, possible left phrenic nerve
 palsy, extending to ipsilateral and contralateral medistinal lymph nodes.
