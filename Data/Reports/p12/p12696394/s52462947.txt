                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  Recent CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A residual vague
 opacity in the left mid lung associated with a fiducial marker appears
 unchanged. Multifocal opacities in the upper lobes are probably unchanged
 allowing for differences in modality.  Superimposed reticulation suggests mild
 vascular congestion.  On the right, there is again a moderate pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Persistent moderate-sized
 right-sided pleural effusion.
