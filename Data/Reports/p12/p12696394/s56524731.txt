 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-left lung biopsy peripheral left upper lobe mass,
 questionable pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Otherwise
 there is no relevant change.  Constant size and appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.
