                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with elevated white count s/p L TKR, ___ year
 smoker, r/o infectious process  // elevated WBC post-op, ___ year smoker, r/o
 infectious process     elevated WBC post-op, ___ year smoker, r/o infectious
 process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains at
 the upper limits of normal or and mildly enlarged and there is again
 tortuosity of the aorta.  No definite vascular congestion.
 There is the vague suggestion of some asymmetric opacification at the left
 base.  This could well represent merely atelectasis, though again the
 appropriate clinical setting, a focus of developing pneumonia could be
 considered.
