                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  SUBDURAL HEMATOMA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low.  Bronchovascular markings are prominent.  There
 is no focal consolidation.  There is biapical pleural thickening.  Minimal
 streaky density at the lung bases likely represents subsegmental atelectasis. 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  The heart is within normal limits in
 size.  The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study demonstrating no active pulmonary disease.  Repeat examination
 with a better inspiratory effort may be helpful.
