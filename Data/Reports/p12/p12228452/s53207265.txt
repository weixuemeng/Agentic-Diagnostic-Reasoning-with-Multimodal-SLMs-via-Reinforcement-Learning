                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 triple-channel pacer device.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
 without definite vascular congestion.  Opacification at the costophrenic
 angles could reflect atelectasis and small effusions.
