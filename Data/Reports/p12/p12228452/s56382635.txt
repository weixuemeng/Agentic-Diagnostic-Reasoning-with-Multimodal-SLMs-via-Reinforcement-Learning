 HISTORY:  Status post biventricular pacemaker placement.  Evaluate lead
 positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior exam.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is interval placement of a left pectoral
 biventricular pacer with adequate position of a right ventricular lead.  The
 presumed left ventricular lead appears to terminates on the diaphragmatic
 surface of the left ventricle.  Lungs are clear.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion but no pneumothorax.  Cholecystectomy clips project over the
 right upper quadrant.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left pectoral biventricular pacer placement with adequate placement of right
 ventricular lead.  Left ventricular lead appears to terminate along the
 diaphragmatic surface of the ventricle.
