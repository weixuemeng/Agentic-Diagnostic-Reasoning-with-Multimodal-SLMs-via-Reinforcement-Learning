 INDICATION:  Cough for two months.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increased interstitial markings suggest a
 chronic process.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.

 may reflect an atypical infection, small airways disease, or chronic lung
 disease. Clinical correlation recommended.
