                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, told she had fluid in
 her lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen bilaterally.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The trachea is deviated to the right
 at the thoracic inlet, potentially due to right-sided thyroid enlargement.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.  Deviation of
 the trachea to the right at the thoracic inlet could be due to underlying
 right-sided thyroid enlargement for which nonurgent thyroid ultrasound can be
 performed.
