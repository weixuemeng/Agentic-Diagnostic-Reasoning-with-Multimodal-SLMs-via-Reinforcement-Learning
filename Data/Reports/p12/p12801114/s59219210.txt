                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relatively
 low lung volumes.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac
 valve replacement.  There is some obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which
 may be due to a left pleural effusion with atelectasis.  No large right
 pleural effusion is seen, although a small one would be difficult to exclude. 
 There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.
