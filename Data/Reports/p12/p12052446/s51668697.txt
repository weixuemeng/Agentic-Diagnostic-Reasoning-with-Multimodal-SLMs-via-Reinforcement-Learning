                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and cough sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac
 silhouette mild to moderately enlarged.  Subtle right upper lobe scarring is
 likely stable.  Hilar contours are stable.  There may be very subtle increase
 in interstitial markings bilaterally which could suggest a component of very
 minimal vascular congestion, but is felt to more likely be artifactual and is
 similar in appearance compared to prior chest radiograph from ___.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  No definite new focal consolidation.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change as compared with ___,
 interstitial markings may be minimally more prominent as compared to ___,
 likely relating to differences in technique versus a very minimal chronic
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
