                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right lower quadrant pain and history of
 CHF, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral opacification with
 perihilar predominance is compatible with mild pulmonary edema, slightly
 increased compared to the prior examination.  Linear right basilar opacities
 adjacent to the right heart border, likely atelectasis; however, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  A small right pleural effusion is present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and increased mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  A focus of linear opacification at the right base, seen as band-like
 perifissural consolidation on the lateral view is most consistent with
 atelectasis. Recurrent atelectasis in the same region over multiple studies
 may be further evaluated with CT.  
 3.  Small right pleural effusion.
