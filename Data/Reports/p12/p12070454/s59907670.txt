 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size.  There is some mild bilateral perihilar

 resolved.  There is streaky opacity at the right lung base suggesting chronic
 scarring in the right middle lobe as well as unchanged blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes again affect the upper thoracic spine.

 Findings suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension.  Chronic unchanged findings
