                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath x3 days.  Fever, cough and dyspnea on
 exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacities with ___ B-lines/septal thickening is consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  More focal right lower lung opacity is concerning for
 superimposed pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is more prominent than on the
 previous examinations.  Trace right pleural effusion is likely also present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema likely obscures a right lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Consider diuresis and re-evaluation for better definition.
