                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man in a motor vehicle collision recently, evaluate
 for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta, with aortic arch calcifications
 noted.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.
 Heart size is top-normal. The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are
 clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No evidence of a displaced rib fracture. If
 rib fractures are strongly suspected, dedicated rib radiographs could be
 obtained to further evaluate for subtle rib fractures.
