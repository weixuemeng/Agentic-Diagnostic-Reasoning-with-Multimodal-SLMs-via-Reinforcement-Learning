                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  New oxygen requirement.  Patient status post ERCP.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are lower lung volumes.  There is a new, almost collapse of the right
 lower lobe.  Left lower atelectasis has worsened.  Upper lobes are clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is difficult to
 evaluate, probably unchanged, partially obscured by the lung abnormalities.
