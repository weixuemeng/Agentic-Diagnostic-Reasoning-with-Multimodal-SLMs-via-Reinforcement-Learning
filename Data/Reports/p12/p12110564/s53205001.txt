                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Underlying interstitial disease is suspected
 with peripheral reticulation.  More confluent but irregular opacities are
 noted in each lower lung, particularly in the left lower lung, involving the
 lingula and probably the left lower lobe.  A small right apical nodular
 opacity measures about 4 mm in diameter.  A more vague 4 mm nodular opacity is
 also identified in the left upper lung.  Mild biapical pleural thickening may
 be accompanied by a small bulla at the right apex.  A trace pleural effusion
 is suspected on the left.  Mild degenerative changes and exaggerated kyphosis
 are noted along the thoracic spine with small anterior osteophytes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting underlying interstitial lung disease.  
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities may represent superimposed pneumonia, although
 chronicity of findings is uncertain without prior radiographs for comparison. 
 
 
 3.  Possible trace pleural effusion on the left.  
 
 4.  Possible nodules.  In addition to clinical correlation including pulmonary
 consultation, it may be appropriate to consider chest CT in follow-up to
 evaluate for nodules and the nature of suspected underlying disease if needed
 clinically.
