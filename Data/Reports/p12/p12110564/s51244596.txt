 Lung volumes are lower today than previously.  Heterogeneous opacification at
 the bases of both lungs can be explained by atelectasis alone but early
 pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration, is possible.
 
 Lateral view confirms small pleural effusions new or newly apparent.  New,
 right supraclavicular central venous infusion port catheter ends in the right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Right apical pleural
 parenchymal nodularity is probably tuberculous scarring.
