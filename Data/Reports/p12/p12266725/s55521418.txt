 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC is unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable status post MIE procedure.  The heart is enlarged but stable. 
 Increasing opacity at the right base.  Left basal opacity is also minimally
 increased from the prior exam.  No pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, similar in extent the prior study.
