                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p ___ MIE ___ for EGJ esophageal ADC T3N___ s/p
 chemoRT // interval assesment; ___M s/p ___ MIE ___ for EGJ
 esophageal ADC T3N___ s/p chemoRT // please r/o pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain chest radiograph dated ___.  Correlation made to
 barium esophagram dated ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had previous esophagectomy.  In comparison to the radiograph
 of 2 days prior, there is a new moderate right pneumothorax.  The right
 pleural effusion has increased.  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is
 unchanged.  Mediastinal drains remain in place.  Radiopaque contrast from a
 recently performed barium esophagram opacifies partially imaged loops of colon
 in the upper abdomen. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the
 projection.
 
 The followup radiograph shows no appreciable change in the moderate right
 pneumothorax, but a significant increase in moderate right pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New moderate right hydropneumothorax is indicative of the anastomotic leak
 demonstrated on the contemporaneous chest CT.
