 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with chest tubes after
 minimally invasive esophagectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an enteric tube
 terminating in the neo esophagus, right subclavian approach central catheter

 overlying the right chest wall.  Heart size remains normal.  Increased
 prominence of the right mediastinum could represent the neo esophagus are
 juxta mediastinal fluid, unchanged dating back to ___.  Increased
 bilateral opacities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally,
 increased right base consolidation could represent atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded.  A small right pleural effusion is increased.   There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Right lower lung consolidation could represent atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded.
 3. Increased right pleural effusion.
