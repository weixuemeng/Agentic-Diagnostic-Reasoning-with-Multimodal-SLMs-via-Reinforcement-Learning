 chemoRT  // interval cxr
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Right basal opacity is minimally increasing on the
 prior exam and likely represents a small effusion and adjacent atelectasis. 
 There is a streaky opacity at the base of the left lung consistent with
 atelectasis.  The right-sided chest tube is in stable position.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The heart
 is top-normal as before.
