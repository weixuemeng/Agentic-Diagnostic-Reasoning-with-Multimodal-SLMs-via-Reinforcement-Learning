 and a h/o TIAs with a new heart murmur on exam  // Evaluate for intracranial

 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright view of the chest provided.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is similar to prior.  Persistent widening of the mediastinum indents the
 trachea, pushing it to the left.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.  Aortic calcifications are similar to prior.  Mild scoliosis is similar
 to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent widening of the mediastinum could be due to an enlarged thyroid,
 but other masses in the mediastinum are not excluded.
 2. No acute intrathoracic process.
