                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and dyspnea, fever to 102, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest.  There is vague increased haziness
 at the lung bases.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably normal study.  Vague haziness at bases may be due to
 technique.  For better assessment, PA and lateral views can be done.
