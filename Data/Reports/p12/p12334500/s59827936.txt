                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected nodule.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  Potential
 opacity projecting over the lateral aspect of the left chest, 3.3 cm in
 length, might represent pleural lipoma.  It is not clearly seen on the prior
 study, but essentially obscured by the scapula.  The lungs are clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Assessment of the patient with
 chest CT might be considered to exclude the possibility of pleural lesion.
