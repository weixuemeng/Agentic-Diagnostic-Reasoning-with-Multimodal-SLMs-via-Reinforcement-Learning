  Severe thoracic kyphosis and rib cage deformity limits the evaluation. 
  Worsening opacity at the left base most conspicuous on the lateral radiograph
  could reflect an evolving pneumonia or aspiration.  There is also increasing
  opacity at the left apex projecting superior to the aortic arch.  Continued
  imaging follow-up is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVC passenger with c2 fracture, now with o2
 desat, and tachycardia  // please compare to prior film     please compare to
 prior film
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, severe thoracic kyphosis
 and rib deformity again make it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. 
 Multiple old healed rib fractures are again seen.  Retrocardiac opacification
 most likely reflects atelectatic change, though the possibility of aspiration
 or infectious pneumonia could certainly not be excluded.  Similarly,
 opacification is again seen superior to the aortic large
