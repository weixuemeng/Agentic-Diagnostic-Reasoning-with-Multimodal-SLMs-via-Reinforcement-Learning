                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, evaluate for acute interval
 thoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___ at 5:10
 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal
 right atrium.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen are
 diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities in a predominantly nodular pattern
 with increased background haziness, probably representing superimposed edema.
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial nodular opacities, increased background
 haziness probably represents increased interstitial edema.
 
 2. Interval development of moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
