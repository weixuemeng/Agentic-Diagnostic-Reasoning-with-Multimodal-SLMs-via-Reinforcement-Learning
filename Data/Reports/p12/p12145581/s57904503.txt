                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AIDS and disseminated fungal infection with Salmonella
 bacteremia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:00 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior study, lung volumes have decreased and
 there are persistent bilateral reticular airspace opacities as well as small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacification likely
 represents atelectasis.  However, dense consolidation can also exist at this
 location.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in lung volumes with continued interstitial
 opacities consistent with pulmonary edema and likely superimposed infection. 
 Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.
