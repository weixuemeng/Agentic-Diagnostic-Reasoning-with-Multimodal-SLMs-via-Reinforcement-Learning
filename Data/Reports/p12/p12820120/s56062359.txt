                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior,
 there has been interval progression of the opacity in the right lung, which
 had been previously resolving pneumonia.  There are now increased parenchymal
 opacities on the left as well.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 identified, some of which appears loculated along the left chest laterally. 
 Dual-lead right-sided chest wall pacing device is again seen.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small bilateral effusions.  Probable worsening of the
 right-sided parenchymal opacities which had been resolving pneumonia on most
 recent exam.  Developing left-sided parenchymal opacities as well, which could
 represent infection although superimposed edema is also possible.
