                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post assault with altered mental status, now intubated,
 here to evaluate for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to artifact from the underlying trauma
 board.  Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube is seen with the tip
 terminating just above the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the right upper quadrant
 within the stomach.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low with streaky
 opacities at the bilateral bases, reflecting atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 injury is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube and NG tube in place.
 2.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  No acute intrathoracic injury.
