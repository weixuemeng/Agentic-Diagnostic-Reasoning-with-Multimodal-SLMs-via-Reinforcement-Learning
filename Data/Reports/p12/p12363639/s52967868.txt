  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Density lateral to the aortic arch is most
  likely due to degenerative change at the ___ costochondral junction.  Repeat
  radiographs with apical lordotic views are recommended to exclude underlying
  parenchymal abnormality.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with L sided chest pain, pleuritic in quality, x 4 days,
 worsening  // eval ? pneumothorax, effusion, infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Density lateral to the aortic arch is most likely due to degenerative change
 at the ___ costochondral junction.  Bibasilar opacities on the frontal view
 without correlates on lateral view most likely represent atelectasis. There is
 no effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Density lateral to the aortic arch is most
 likely due to degenerative change at the left ___ costochondral junction.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiographs with apical lordotic views to exclude
 underlying parenchymal abnormality at the left lung apex.
