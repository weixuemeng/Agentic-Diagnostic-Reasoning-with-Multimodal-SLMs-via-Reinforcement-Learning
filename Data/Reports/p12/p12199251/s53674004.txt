                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation on room air.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from OSH at 10:38.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate severe cardiomegaly. 
 However, there is no focal consolidation, pulmonary vascular congestion
 (unlike prior radiograph), or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Small pleural effusions noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly.  Trace pleural effusions. However, no overt
 signs of pulmonary edema. This is improved when compared to OSH radiograph.
