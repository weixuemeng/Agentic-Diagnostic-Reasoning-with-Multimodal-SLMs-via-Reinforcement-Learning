                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Vomiting and elevated lactate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is again a moderate to large
 pleural effusion on the right, similar in extent, allowing for small
 differences in technique.  There is probably a persistent small to moderate
 effusion on the left, similar to perhaps somewhat decreased.  The parenchyma
 shows an interstitial abnormality of moderate severity which is most
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  Partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe
 is probably unchanged.  Along of the in the left lower lobe right lower lobe. 
 Fissures are again thickened. The bones appear demineralized.  Biliary stents
 project over the right upper quadrant.  No evidence for free air is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions,
 including a moderate to large suspected effusion on the right side; no
 significant change, however.
