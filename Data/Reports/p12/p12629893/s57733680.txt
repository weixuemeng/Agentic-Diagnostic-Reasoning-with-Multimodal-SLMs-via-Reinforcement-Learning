                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question acute process in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable view of the chest is provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  The patient is intubated
 with the endotracheal tube tip residing approximately 6.6 cm above the carina.
 There are coarsened interstitial markings noted bilaterally concerning for
 interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. There is a 2.5 x 3.3 cm opacity in the right
 suprahilar region, of unclear etiology. A small right pleural effusion may be
 present given the blunted right CP angle, though pleural thickening is also
 within the ddx.  Comparison with prior imaging studies would be helpful to
 assess for any interval changes.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Findings suggestive of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis with small right
 pleural effusion (vs pleural thickening).  Please correlate clinically and
 comparison with prior imaging studies would be helpful to assess interval
 change.
 2.  2.5 x 3.3 cm opacity in the right suprahilar region - correlate clinically
 and in the absence of prior imaging, a chest CT is recommended.
