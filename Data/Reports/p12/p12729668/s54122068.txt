                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CTA chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Scattered bilateral airspace opacities,
 slightly sparing the lung apices, are again noted, slightly worsened from the
 prior study, consistent with a multifocal pneumonia. Surgical clips and a
 biliary stent are seen in the right upper quadrant.  There has been interval
 removal of a malpositioned right PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in extensive bilateral airspace
 opacities is compatible with worsening multifocal pneumonia.
