                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with S/p cardiac arrest, transfer // Acute cardiopulmonary
 process, line placement, tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is seen.  The carina is difficult to delineate but the
 tip is likely approximately 3 cm from the carina.  Left-sided subclavian line
 is seen coiled over the upper mediastinum.  An enteric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with distal tip not well visualized.
 
 The patient is rotated and lung volumes are low.
 No pneumothorax or effusion is noted on this supine film.  The mediastinum
 appears wide although this may be due to AP technique and low lung volumes,
 the possibility of underlying abnormality such as hematoma should be
 considered.  There is increased density in the paramediastinal regions as
 well, potentially due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mediastinum appears wide although this may be due to AP technique and low
 lung volumes, considering patient's recent lesion, mediastinal hematoma should
 also be considered.  .
 2. Endotracheal tube is seen with distal tip terminating approximately 3.0
 above the carina which is not particularly well delineated.
 3. Left-sided subclavian line is coiled over the mediastinum.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:40 PM, 1 minute after discovery
 of the findings.
