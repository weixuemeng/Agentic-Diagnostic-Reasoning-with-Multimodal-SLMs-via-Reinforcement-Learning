                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest, intubated, high PEEP and FiO2
 requirement  // eval for interval change, ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked widening of cardiomediastinal contours is similar to recent chest
 radiograph of 1 day earlier and appears to correspond predominantly to
 mediastinal lipomatosis on CTA chest ___.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis has worsened in the interval, particularly in the right
 retrocardiac region.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small in size, and there
 is no definite pneumothorax.
