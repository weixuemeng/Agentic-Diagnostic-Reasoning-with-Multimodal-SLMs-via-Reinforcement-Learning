                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with elevated WBC, prior ?pna on CXR  // eval for
 pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___ and allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but probably similar, allowing
 for differences in technique.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 CHF, unchanged.  There are subtle patchy opacities at both lung bases, which
 appear similar to the prior study.  No progression in these areas to suggest
 developing aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia is identified.  No frank
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change.  Please see comment above.
