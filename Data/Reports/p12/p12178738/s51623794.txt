                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with met. esophageal ca, is SOB. Recently had
 ablation of chest wall tumor at ___.  // Degree of pleural fluid? Extent of
 masses?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  Right heart border and lower
 mediastinal contours are obscured by a large multi loculated pleural
 abnormality including fissural fluid loculation.  Moderate volume loss in the
 right hemithorax indicates that severe atelectasis in the right middle and
 lower lobes exceeds volume displacement by the pleural effusion.  Right hilus
 may be enlarged.
 
 Two subcentimeter nodules are seen in the middle and upper left lung.  Left
 pleural effusion is tiny.
 
 The tip of a right central venous infusion port catheter is in the right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large multi loculated right pleural abnormality, including fissural fluid
 loculations, accompanied by severe atelectasis right middle and lower lobes
 and possible right hilar mass.
 2. At least 2 subcentimeter nodules in the left mid and upper lungs.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend obtaining prior chest radiographs and/or chest
 CT, with intravenous contrast if tolerated, for elucidation of the findings on
 this study.
