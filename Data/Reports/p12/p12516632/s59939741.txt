                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis, on chemotherapy.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Hilar markings are
 prominent bilaterally, right slightly greater than left.  Increased density
 overlying the right hilum may represent prominent pulmonary vessels,
 lymphadenopathy, or potentially a small focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion is present.  The osseous structures are unremarkable. 
 Metallic clips overlie the upper outer left breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent right hilum with density that may represent prominent
 pulmonary vessels, lymph node, or potentially a small focal consolidation. 
 Comparison may be made with prior radiographs or, if not available, a chest CT
 may be obtained for further evaluation.
 
 Findings were emailed to the emergency department QA nurse.
