                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, but unchanged in appearance.  Post-sternotomy wires
 are unremarkable.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, moderate on the
 right and small-to-moderate on the left.  No definitive pneumothorax is seen,
 although lucency at the left lower lung might reflect loculated pneumothorax
 and should be further assessed on the subsequent radiographs.
