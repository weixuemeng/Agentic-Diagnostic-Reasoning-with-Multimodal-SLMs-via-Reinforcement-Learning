 INDICATION:  Oxygen requirement.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild cardiomegaly with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, unchanged from ___. Patchy opacification of
 the left lung base may represent atelectasis with a small left pleural
 effusion, the latter of which appears unchanged.  There is plate-like
 atelectasis in the right lung base. Cervical spine fusion hardware is again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Opacification of the left lung base likely represents an area of atelectasis
 with small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild cardiomegaly.
