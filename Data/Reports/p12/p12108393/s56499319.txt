 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There are diffuse
 airspace opacities most prominent within the perihilar regions, right greater
 than left.  This may represent focal pneumonia or aspiration.  Pulmonary edema

 resolution of the opacities is recommended.  There are no pneumothoraces or
 pleural effusions.
