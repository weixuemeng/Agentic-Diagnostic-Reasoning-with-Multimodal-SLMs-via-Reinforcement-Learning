                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a heroin overdose.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Interval improvement in bilateral
 perihilar airspace opacities with air bronchograms, particularly on the left,
 suggests improving noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Peripheral, right upper
 lobe consolidation appears slightly worse, concerning for superimposed
 aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving bilateral perihilar opacities suggest improving noncardiogenic
 edema.  Worsening right upper lobe consolidation suggests possible
 superimposed aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia, although
 asymmetrical edema is also possible.
