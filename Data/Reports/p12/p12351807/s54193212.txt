                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sudden onset chest discomfort, dyspnea, now improving,
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Ill definition of the inferior left hila on the frontal view shows no
 correlate on the lateral view  and is therefore thought to represent artifact,
 possibly due to the configuration of the thoracic cage.
 
 Otherwise, the lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion detected.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 Note is made of mild right convex curvature centered in the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt acute pulmonary process.  Faint opacity in the left infrahilar region is
 seen only on the frontal view and is therefore thought to represent artifact.
