                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p lap chole, now with chest congestion,
 increased somonolence. Assess for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, lung volumes are significantly lower with
 evidence of increased pulmonary vascular congestion. A left retrocardiac
 opacity may be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in this
 clinical setting. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Intact median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot
 be excluded, given this clinical setting.
 
 2. Notably lower lung volumes with increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
