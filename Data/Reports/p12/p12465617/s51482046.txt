                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wounds with bilateral pneumothoraces.  Chest tubes removed. 
 Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral chest tubes
 have been removed.  Small left apical pneumothorax is seen.  Allowing for
 differences in patient positioning, this is not significantly changed from
 7:40 a.m..  The cardiac and hilar, and mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 vascular pedicle appears normal.  Small pleural effusions probably contain
 blood as seen on CT.  There is no focal consolidation.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 of both hemithoraces is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Allowing for differences in
 patient positioning, unchanged from the 7:40 a.m.
