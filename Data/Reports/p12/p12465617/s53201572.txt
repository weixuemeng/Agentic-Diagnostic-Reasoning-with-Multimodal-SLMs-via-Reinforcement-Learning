                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wound.  Evaluate for interval change in pneumothoraces.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso, ___.  Multiple chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a widened vascular
 pedicle, different in contour than initial radiograph.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 involving both hemithoraces is again seen.  The bilateral chest tubes are in
 place, but tiny left pneumothorax is appreciated and the left tube still
 impinges on the mediastinum.  No pneumothorax is seen on the right.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mediastinum remains widened with abnormal contour.  Given lack of
 remote comparison, 6 hour follow-up radiograph is recommended.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 10:47
 a.m. on ___.
