                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with rib fracture.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval resorption of subcutaneous gas.  A trace
 right apical pneumothorax persists.  The lungs are well expanded. Small
 parenchymal basilar opacities are likely sequelae of prior chest tube
 insertion.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours
 are normal.  Nondisplaced posterior fractures are better appreciated on the
 comparison CT.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace residual right apical pneumothorax, with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
