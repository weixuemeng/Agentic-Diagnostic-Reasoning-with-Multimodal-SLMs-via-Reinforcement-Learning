                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness breath.  Evaluate for congestive
 heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Opacity in the left lower hemithorax with silhouetting
 of the left hemidiaphragm, lateral border of the descending aorta, and left
 inferior aspect of the cardiac silhouette may reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Pulmonary edema is mild.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  Aortic knob calcifications are mild.  No pneumothorax. 
 Concurrent focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region cannot be completely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.  The patient is slightly
 rotated with mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine.  No acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most suggestive of volume overload and/or heart failure. Concurrent
 left lower lobe consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 situation
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral radiograph could help.
