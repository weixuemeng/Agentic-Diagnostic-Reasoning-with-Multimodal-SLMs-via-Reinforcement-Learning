                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall, evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased airspace opacity in the right lower lung may represent atelectasis
 or pneumonia depending on the clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including
 a tortuous aorta and mild to moderate cardiomegaly, is unchanged.  Bilateral
 minimally displaced lower lateral rib fractures are noted, difficult to assess
 due to overlapping structures
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimally displaced bilateral rib fractures.
 2. Right lower lobe airspace opacity may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or
 developing pneumonia.  Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful
 for more complete evaluation of this region if warranted clinically.
