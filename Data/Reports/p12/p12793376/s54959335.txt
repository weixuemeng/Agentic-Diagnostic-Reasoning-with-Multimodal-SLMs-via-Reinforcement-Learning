                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___/F s/p R TKA POD4, with persistent hypoxia. Please r/o
 pneumonia.  // Atalectasis vs infiltrate?      Atalectasis vs infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 08:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 17:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema.  Streaky opacities
 at the bases more likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis rather
 than an acute infectious process. However, clinical correlation is advised. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Small left effusion, less apparent on the current
 study than on the prior. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged.  Degenerative changes of both
 glenohumeral joints with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
