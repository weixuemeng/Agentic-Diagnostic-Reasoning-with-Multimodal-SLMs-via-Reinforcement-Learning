                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes with overlying minimal basilar atelectasis.  There is mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity
 most likely relates to atelectasis rather than consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable given differences in inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite findings to suggest pneumonia. 
 Likely left base atelectasis.
