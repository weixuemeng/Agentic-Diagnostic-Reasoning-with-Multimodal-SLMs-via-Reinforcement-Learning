                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern, not
 significantly changed compared to the prior study and possibly related to
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  Upper lung fibrosis with superior
 retraction of the hila is unchanged.  There are no focal consolidations
 concerning for pneumonia.  The heart is borderline enlarged, unchanged in
 size.  There are no pleural abnormalities.  Kyphosis of the thoracic spine is
 again noted.  Surgical clips are seen in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with chronic interstitial lung process.
