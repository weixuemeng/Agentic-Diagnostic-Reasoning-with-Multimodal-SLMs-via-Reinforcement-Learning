                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia, to assess for resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right mid lung
 opacification laterally appears to be slightly smaller.  There is little
 change in the appearance of the opacification in the left lung at
 approximately the same level.  Tenting of the right hemidiaphragm is again
 seen.
 
 A repeat study within approximately two weeks would be helpful to demonstrate
 further clearing of this process.
