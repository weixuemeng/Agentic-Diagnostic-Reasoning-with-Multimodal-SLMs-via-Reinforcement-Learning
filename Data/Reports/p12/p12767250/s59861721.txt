 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.  There is a
 nasogastric tube but it terminates at the level of the mid mediastinum.  Since
 its proximal course does not correspond to the trachea, however, it is
 probably in the esophagus rather than in the airway.  There is tortuosity of
 the aorta which is mild.  Patchy left infrahilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  There may be a very small lung nodule at the right lung apex
 perhaps measuring 6 mm.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating near the thoracic inlet.  Orogastric tube
 terminating in the mid esophagus.  If Egastric positioning is desired then
 advancing the tube substantially is suggested.
 
 2.  Patchy left infrahilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis, although
 etiologies such as aspiration could also be considered in the appropriate
 setting.
 
 3.  Possible right apical lung nodule.  Given clinically appropriate, further
 evaluation with chest CT could be considered.
