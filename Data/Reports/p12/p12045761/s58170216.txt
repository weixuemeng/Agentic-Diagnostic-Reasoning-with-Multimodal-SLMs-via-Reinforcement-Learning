 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post flap.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position.  There
 is no large pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe collapse and a small left pleural
 effusion are unchanged.  Right lower lobe consolidation is also unchanged.
 There is left subcutaneous emphysema.  A presumed left chest tube is difficult
 to evaluate given technique.
