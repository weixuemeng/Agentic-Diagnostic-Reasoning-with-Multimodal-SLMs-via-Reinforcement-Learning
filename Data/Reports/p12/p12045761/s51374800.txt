                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:59
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post TAA repair, evaluate for
 consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 16:33.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film, ___ at 5:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are
 unchanged in position.  There are stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours in this patient status post a thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. 
 Overall, there is improving aeration in the left lung, although there is
 persistent retrocardiac opacity which may reflect lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is also patchy opacity
 persisting at the right base which may represent atelectasis, although an
 early infectious process cannot be excluded.  Given overall interval
 improvement, this is felt to most likely reflect resolving mild pulmonary
 edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Small
 to moderate layering left effusion.  No large right effusion is seen.
