                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with altered mental status, likely hepatic
 encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There is
 minimal interstitial edema.  Basilar opacities are seen on the frontal view,
 not substantiated on the lateral view and may relate to bibasilar atelectasis
 with prominent vascular structures, although underlying infection or
 aspiration is not excluded, although felt less likely.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 Evidence of DISH is seen along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Mild
 prominence of the interstitial markings raises concern for mild interstitial
 edema.  Bibasilar, right greater than left opacities seen on the frontal view
 may be due to combination of overlying vascular structures; however,
 underlying consolidation from infection or aspiration is not excluded.
