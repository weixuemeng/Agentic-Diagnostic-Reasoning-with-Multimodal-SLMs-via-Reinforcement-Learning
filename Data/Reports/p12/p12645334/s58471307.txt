                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right hemothorax, small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:58 a.m.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is a small right apical pneumothorax, slightly
 larger than on the earlier film.  Again seen is the coiled catheter at the
 right lung base, slightly different in configuration.  There is continued
 small pleural/hemorrhagic effusion at the right base, with some underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, overall similar to prior.  Atelectasis and left
 costophrenic angle blunting is also similar.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax, slightly larger.  Effusion at
 right base is similar.  Note made of changed configuration of the catheter at
 the right lung base.
