 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCC status post ORIF complicated by right hemothorax status post
 tube placement.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Two separate AP views of the chest were obtained. One of the views was
 obtained with fairly good inspiratory volumes (but exclusion of the CP angles)
 and demonstrates mild vascular plethora.  The other view was obtained with low
 inspiratory volumes (but includes the CP angles), which artifactually
 accentuates the appearance of  pulmonary vascular plethora.  This report is
 based on the film obtained with better inspiratory volumes.
 
 A pigtail type catheter overlies the right lung base, new compared with a film
 from ___ at 00:27 am. Again seen is a small to moderate right pleural
 effusion/hemothorax, slightly improved compated with the prior film, with
 asociated right lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is patchy
 retrocardiac opacity, similar to prior, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.   No pneumothorax is detected.  Small amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right chest wall, without
 significant interval change.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and appears slightly  slightly
 larger than on the prior film.  Mild vascular plethora is present, similar,
 but possibly slightly worse.
