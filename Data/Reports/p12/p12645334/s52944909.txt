 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiograph ___ ___ and CT abdomen ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and demonstrate
 left ventricular configuration and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Linear
 opacities are present in the right lower lobe peripherally adjacent to healed
 right rib fracture and probably represent a combination of linear atelectasis
 and scarring.  New small right pleural effusion, likely accounts for lateral
 blunting of right costophrenic sulcus.  Left pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion.
