                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  HCC, right middle lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  As a consequence, there is crowding of vascular and bronchial structures
 at the lung bases.  In addition, on today's radiograph, probably due in part
 to different patient position, the right hilus appears larger and the right
 mediastinal aspects are also larger.  The contour, however, is even, so that
 the interface that appears enlarged is likely caused by a vascular structure. 
 However, short-term followup with radiographs should be performed.
 
 There is unchanged mild fluid overload and moderate cardiomegaly.  No larger
 pleural effusions.
