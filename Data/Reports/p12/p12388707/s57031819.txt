                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with concern for GI bleed and possible aspiration
 with wheezing on exam.  // evaluate for infection vs. pneumonitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP semi upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is in part due to the AP
 technique and supine positioning.  Lung volumes are low.  Persistent
 opacification of the left base probably represents atelectasis however
 superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.  The right lung is clear. 
 There is increased pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes and at least moderate atelectasis at the left base.
