 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 now measures approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Again there are displaced
 rib fractures on the left, but no evidence of pneumothorax.  Relatively low
 lung volumes with increased opacification at the left base consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and fluid in the pleural space.
