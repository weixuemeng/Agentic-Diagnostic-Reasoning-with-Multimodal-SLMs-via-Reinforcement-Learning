 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Asthma, cough and wheeze.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Wedge-shaped deformities,
 T2 fractures in lower thoracic vertebral bodies and upper lumbar spine are
 again noted.  Degenerative changes are present in both glenohumeral joints. 
 There are probable rib fractures in the third and fourth right ribs.
