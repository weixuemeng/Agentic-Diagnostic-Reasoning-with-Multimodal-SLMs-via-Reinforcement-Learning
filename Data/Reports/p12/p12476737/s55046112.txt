                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with moderate-severe asthma on chronic steroids
 with recent pneumonia at rehab s/p antibiotic course, now asymptomatic  //
 6-week follow up to evaluation resolution
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval resolution of previously seen
 lingular opacity, compatible with resolution of pneumonia. Discoid atelectasis
 is present in the right lung base, along with eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm, stable compared to the prior study.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated, in keeping with known severe COPD. No new focal opacities are
 identified, and there is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary
 edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Partially visualized
 posterior fusion hardware in the lumbar spine a noted. Degenerative changes of
 the bilateral glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of lingular lobe pneumonia since the prior study.
