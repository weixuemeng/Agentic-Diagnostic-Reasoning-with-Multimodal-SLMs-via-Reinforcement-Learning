                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged, with redemonstration of
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Mediastinal width is unchanged from prior
 examination and is likely slightly exaggerated by slight leftward patient
 rotation as well as levoscoliotic curvature of the thoracic spine.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is a vague opacity obscuring the left heart
 border although not depicted on the lateral view.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged.  Prominent degenerative changes of bilateral shoulders are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity suspected in the lingula; early pneumonia or
 atelectasis could be considered.
