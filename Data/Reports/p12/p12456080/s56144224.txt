                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous mitral valve replacement. 
 Heart is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Within the lungs, patchy and linear opacities in the right middle
 and both lower lobes  are noted, most prominent in the right middle lobe. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Bones are diffusely demineralized and note is made
 of bilateral shoulder prostheses.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
 2.  Right middle and bibasilar opacities probably represent a combination of
 atelectasis and scarring.  However, followup chest x-ray in ___ weeks is
 suggested to reassess the dominant right middle lobe opacity in order to
 exclude an active process in this region.
