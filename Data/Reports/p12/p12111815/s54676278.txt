                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A hiatal hernia is visible on the
 frontal view.  A small amount of air is visible within it.  Patchy medial
 right lower lung opacity suggests minor atelectasis in the right middle lobe. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes
 affect the right acromioclavicular joint.  A suture anchor projects along the
 left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Small to moderate hiatal hernia. 
 Patchy medial right basilar opacity, suggestive of atelectasis.
