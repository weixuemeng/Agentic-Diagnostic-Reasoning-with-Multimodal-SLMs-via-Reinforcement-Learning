                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with an abnormal chest radiograph on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Borderline hyperinflation is longstanding and could be due to small airways
 obstruction or mild emphysema.  Region of relatively linear peribronchial
 opacification in the left lower lung laterally has improved.  This could be
 due to acute inflammation, but is more likely region of chronic scarring. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear of any focal abnormality and there is no pleural
 effusion or indication of central adenopathy.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
