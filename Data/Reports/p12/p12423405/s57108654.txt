                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Two months of cough, sometimes with blood-tinged
 sputum, history of asthma.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear except for left
 lower lobe opacity, linear but with some ground-glass opacities that might
 reflect atelectasis, though infectious process in this location cannot be
 excluded.  Followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy is recommended.  If findings persist, evaluation with chest
 CT would be an appropriate next step.
