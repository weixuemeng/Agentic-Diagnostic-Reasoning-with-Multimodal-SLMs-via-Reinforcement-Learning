                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and
 right pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph dated ___. Correlation also made to
 CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A coiled drainage catheter drainage catheter remains in place at the anterior
 right basal pleural space. The small partially loculated right pleural
 effusion is not significantly changed in size since the study of 5 days ago.
 The right fifth posterior rib and part of the right sixth rib have been
 resected. However, there is new cortical displacement at the lateral aspect of
 the right fourth posterior rib, which raises concern for a new fracture. The
 left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. Right basilar atelectasis is
 slightly increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged partially loculated right pleural effusion with pigtail catheter in
 place.
 
 New nondisplaced right fourth posterior rib fracture.
