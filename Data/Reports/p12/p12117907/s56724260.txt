                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with right scapular pain.  History of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A chest tube was removed.  There is similar volume loss in the
 right hemithorax with an oval opacity suggesting a loculated pleural
 collection as well as the possibility of a small more free-flowing type of
 pleural effusion at the base of the right chest as well as areas of scarring
 and atelectasis.  Findings associated with a known malignancy are not
 optimally assessed with radiographs and persistent infection is not excluded;
 however, the only change is slightly improved aeration in the right mid lung
 since the more recent of the comparison studies.  Non-displaced but recent
 right-sided rib fractures involving the fourth and fifth ribs appear
 unchanged.
