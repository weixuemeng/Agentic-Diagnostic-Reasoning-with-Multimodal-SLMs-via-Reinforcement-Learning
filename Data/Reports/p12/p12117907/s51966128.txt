                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with acute onset sob, metastatic lung cancer with history of
 right pleural effusion, assess for pneumonia, aspiration or interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.  In this patient with known right lung
 mass better assessed on prior CT, there is increasing right pleural effusion
 and increasing consolidation in the right lower lung. Pneumonia, aspiration
 and atelectasis are within the differential. Destructive changes involving
 several right ribs is secondary to osseous metastatic disease. Left lung is
 grossly clear though subtle opacities projecting over the left upper and lower
 lungs may represent nodules. Heart size is difficult to assess though appears
 grossly stable. Mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening right pleural effusion and increasing consolidation in the right
 lower lung raises concern for pneumonia, aspiration versus atelectasis.
 2. Destructive bony changes involving multiple right sided ribs.
 3. Subtle opacities in the left upper and lower lung may represent metastasis.
