                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right base
 opacity may relate to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable although the right cardiac silhouette is not well
 seen due to the right basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, right
 basilar consolidation not excluded.
