                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest discomfort and weakness.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  A calcified nodule in the right upper lobe is noted and is
 possibly surrounded by a cavity. This likely represents sequela of prior
 tuberculosis infection.  There are no definite signs of reactivation an no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal and a coronary stent is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Findings likely representing prior granulomatous infection in the right
 upper lobe without strong evidence of reactivation infection. Recommend
 comparison with prior radiographs. If none are available, a CT can be obtained
 for further clarification.
 2. Findings compatible with COPD.
