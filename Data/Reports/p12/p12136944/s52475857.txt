  1. Possible right lower lobe moderate atelectasis versus small consolidation
  or aspiration.
  2. 8 mm right mid-zone nodular opacity may reflect a nodule. Correlate with

  imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is top normal.  The lung volumes are markedly low, resulting in
 substantial bronchovascular crowding.  Right lower zone opacity represents
 moderate atelectasis, although underlying aspiration or consolidation cannot
 be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 An 8 mm right mid-zone round opacity may reflect a pulmonary nodule. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Possible right lower lobe moderate atelectasis versus small consolidation
 or aspiration.
 2. 8 mm right mid-zone nodular opacity may reflect a nodule. Correlate with
 any prior cross sectional imaging or correlate with outpatient chest CT
 imaging. 
 
 Findings were posted on the wet read dashboard and disucssed by Dr. ___ with
