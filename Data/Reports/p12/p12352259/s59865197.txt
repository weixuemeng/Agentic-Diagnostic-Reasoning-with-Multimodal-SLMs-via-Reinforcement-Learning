                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Meningitis, intubated with a right IJ.  Assess for IJ and
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside hospital chest CT performed same
 day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating
 at the level of the carina and could be withdrawn 1-2 cm.  Right-sided central
 venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  Enteric catheter courses below
 the hemidiaphragm with sideport at the level of the GE junction and thus,
 could be obtained several cm.  Left lower lung opacification is nonspecific
 and differential includes pneumonia or aspiration ; however, degree of left
 hilar depression suggesting predominant component is atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion identified.  No fracture is identified 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube at level of carina and could be withdrawn 2 cm.  Sideport of
 enteric catheter at GE junction and could be advanced several cm.  Left lower
 lung pneumonia and loss of volume(upon review of OSH CT, due to mucoid
 impaction of lower lobe bronchus)
