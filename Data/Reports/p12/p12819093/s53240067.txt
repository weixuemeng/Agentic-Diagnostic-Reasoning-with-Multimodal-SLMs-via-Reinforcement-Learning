                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of melanoma.  Evaluate for nodules.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation, nodules, or pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The left hilum is
 prominent in comparison to the right.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise normal.  Osseous structures are unremarkable without concerning
 lesions.  There is no evidence of a compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominent left hilum.  Given the lack of pulmonary abnormalities on the
 recent PET-CT, this is likely a normal variant.  If prior chest radiographs
 are available, comparison would be helpful to document stability.  If further
 evaluation is clinically warranted, a CT of the chest could be obtained.
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary nodules.
