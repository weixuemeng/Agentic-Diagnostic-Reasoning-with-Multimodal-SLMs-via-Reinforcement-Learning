                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 20:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old postop day #2 from robotic VATS wedge
 resection, decreased saturations in high 80s with ambulation.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 10:36.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 20:22 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged with post-surgical changes at
 the apex and small opacity in the apex medially, which has slightly improved,
 suggesting improving aeration and postoperative changes.  There is blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, likely reflecting a small effusion.  Left lung
 remains grossly clear.  Rounded nodular opacity at the left base likely
 reflects a nipple shadow.  Left basilar linear opacity likely represents
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Overall, the right lateral chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema has resolved.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
