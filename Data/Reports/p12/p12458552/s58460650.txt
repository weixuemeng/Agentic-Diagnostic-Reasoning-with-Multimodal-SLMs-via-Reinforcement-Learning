                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain on inspiration. Recent robotic VATS wedge resections of the
 right lung.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrates a persistent small right apical
 hydropneumothorax, with increased fluid in the apical pleural space since the
 prior study.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is persistent,
 representing a small right pleural effusion is unchanged since the prior
 study, as has the left subsegmental basilar atelectasis. Opacity within the
 medial right upper lung field is unchanged, likely related to prior surgery. 
 No new focal opacities are identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable in appearance.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right hydropneumothorax with increased fluid in the right apex, and
 small right basilar pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no significant change the
 prior study.
