 INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___, ___, ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There has
 been resolution of the right basilar pleural effusion with no new left pleural
 effusion.  Previous right apical hydropneumothorax has been replaced entirely
 by fluid. Emphysematous changes in the apices is noted.  Opacity within the
 medial right upper lung field is mostly resolved.  Left apical pleural
 scarring is again seen.  Left basilar atelectasis persists, and there is new
 right basilar atelectasis.  Calcified pleural plaques are seen in the right
 lung, consistent with prior asbestos exposure. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pleural fluid collection with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
