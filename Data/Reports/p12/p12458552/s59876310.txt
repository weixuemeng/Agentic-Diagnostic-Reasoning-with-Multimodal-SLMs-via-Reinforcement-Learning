                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough in the patient post-influenza A infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Previously noted biapical opacities have increased on the
 right and could represent scarring, however, pulmonary malignancy is not
 excluded.  Located inferior to the right apical opacity, there are three new
 nodules, the largest measures 7 mm and projects over the right clavicle and
 the posterior right fourth rib.  Unchanged mild hyperinflation of the lungs
 and flattening of the diaphragm suggests COPD.  The heart size is normal and
 the aorta is tortuous but normal in caliber.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in right apical opacity and three new right upper lung
 opacities located inferiorly could be scarring, however, malignancy cannot be
 excluded.  CT chest is recommended for clarification.
 
 COMMENT: These findings were placed on the cricial results dashboard by Dr.
