                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left breast pain and bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior radiograph, the lung volumes are low,
 causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Despite the low lung
 volumes, the increased interstitial prominence is consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal, and unchanged from prior exams.  Prominent pretracheal soft tissue is
 also stable since ___ and may be due to prominent vasculature, or less
 likely, an enlarged thyroid.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema which is accentuated by low lung volumes.
