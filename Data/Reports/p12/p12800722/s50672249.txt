 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, evaluation for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now
 visible in its entire course.  The tip projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The course is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  No change in borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
