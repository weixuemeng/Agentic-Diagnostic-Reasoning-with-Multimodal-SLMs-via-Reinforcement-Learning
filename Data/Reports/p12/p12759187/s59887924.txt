                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p temp HD line and temp wire from bilateral
 IJs  // Eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  A
 right internal jugular temporary pacing wire is in appropriate position, the
 tip appears to be in the right ventricle.  There is a persistent right pleural
 effusion.  Hazy opacity throughout the right lung is likely due to layering of
 the pleural effusion, difficult to exclude underlying consolidation.  There is
 moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, similar in appearance when compared to
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The temporary pacing wire terminates in the expected location of the right
 ventricle.  The left internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
