 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a diffuse interstitial abnormality, consistent with mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema, which is slightly increased since the prior exam. There is no
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Again, the lungs are slightly hyperexpanded. The heart is
 markedly enlarged, and similar in size to the prior exam. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  Multiple mild compression
 deformities are noted in the thoracic spine, and stable in appearance.
