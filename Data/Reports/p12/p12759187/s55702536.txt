                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis, recent ppm placement  //
 interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:31
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Again seen is the single lead left-sided pacemaker, lead tip over right
 ventricle.  Inspiratory volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  There may be minimal upper zone redistribution and slight vascular
 plethora, but I doubt other evidence of CHF.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is
 also again noted.   A small right effusion is likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
