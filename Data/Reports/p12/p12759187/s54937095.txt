                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to multiple chest radiographs, most recently dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Double right-sided heart contour is
 suggestive of left atrial enlargement.  Coarsened interstitium is noted
 throughout with increased bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, which
 suggest likely developing infectious process possibly on a background of
 minimal pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may indicate
 developing infectious process.
