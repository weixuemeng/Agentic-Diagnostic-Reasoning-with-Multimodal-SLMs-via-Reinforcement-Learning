                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  //
 R/O pulmonary edema, R/O pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded.  There are increased predominantly central and
 perihilar patchy airspace opacities consistent with worsening pulmonary edema,
 although multifocal pneumonia remains a possibility in the proper clinical
 context.  Unchanged biapical pleuroparenchymal thickening.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The size of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta appears tortuous.
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects at the level of the clavicular
 heads, 6.4 cm from the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing mid perihilar and central airspace opacities consistent with
 worsening pulmonary edema, although multifocal pneumonia remains a
 possibility.
 
 The tip of a new endotracheal tube projects at the level of the clavicular
 heads, 6.4 cm from the carina.
