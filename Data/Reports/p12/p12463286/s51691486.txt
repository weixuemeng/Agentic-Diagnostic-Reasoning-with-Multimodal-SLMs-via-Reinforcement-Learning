                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with chest pain, hypotension  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild interstitial
 edema.  Patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities are noted, and may be related
 to underlying edema, though focal pneumonia is certainly possible.  Biapical
 scarring is chronic.  Re- demonstrated are prominent loops of what appear to
 be colon in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial edema.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities which are worse
 since prior could be in part due to infection.  If patient is amenable, PA and
 lateral may help further characterize.
