 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with throat cancer, GIB   recent NSTEMI now with
 hypoxemia shortness of breath, aspiration risk  // any aspiration or PNA?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, interstitial edema has
 resolved.  Multifocal patchy parenchymal opacities have worsened. Post
 radiation changes in the lung apices have been more fully assessed by prior CT
 of ___, which also demonstrated lung nodules, likely below the
 resolution of portable radiographs.  Distended loops of bowel in the upper
 abdomen are not well evaluated on this chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Resolution of interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Worsening multifocal patchy opacities, potentially due to widespread
 aspiration or developing multifocal pneumonia
 .
 
 3.  Once the patient's acute pulmonary abnormality resolves, followup chest CT
 is recommended to reassess pulmonary nodules detected on ___ chest CT.
