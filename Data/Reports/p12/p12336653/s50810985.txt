                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with persistent worsening right-sided rib/chest
 pain status post blunt injury on treatment for bronchitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None at this institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated.  There is an opacity inferiorly and posterior on the lateral film
 without definite correlation on the frontal projection.  This focus follows
 the course of the pulmonary vessels appears more mass-like opacity.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  No effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is asymmetric slight pleural thickening in between the fifth and seventh
 anterior right ribs.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Irregular pulmonary opacity inferiorly and posteriorly on the lateral
 projection may reflect prominent pulmonary vasculature or a primary pulmonary
 process.  Routine oblique projections are recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 2)  Symmetric right pleural thickening in between the fifth and seventh
 anterior right ribs.  A dedicated rib series with a radiopaque marker placed
 at the site of any pain is recommended for further evaluation.
