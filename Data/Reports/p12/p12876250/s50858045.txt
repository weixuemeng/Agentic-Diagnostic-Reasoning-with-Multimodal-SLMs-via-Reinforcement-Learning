 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This patient is known for a chronic interstitial lung disease as
 shown in the previous CT scan.  However, there are additional interstitial
 opacities that suggest a superimposed moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. 
 The cardiac contour is mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 right jugular catheter is in adequate position.
 
 CONCLUSION:  The patient has a mild chronic interstitial lung disease. There
 is a superimposed moderate interstitial pulmonary edema that has not changed
 significantly since the previous exam.
