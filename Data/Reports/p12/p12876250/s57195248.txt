                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, new IJ line placement.  Evaluate for pneumonia and assess
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 12:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular
 central venous catheter, with its tip overlying the low SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are more fully inflated on the present radiograph,
 with decreased minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is re-demonstration of
 central pulmonary vascular engorgement as well as increased conspicuity of a
 diffuse interstitial abnormality, likely reflecting worsening mild pulmonary
 edema.  There are no pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is re-demonstration of deformity of the posterior right
 fourth rib, likely relating to remote trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased diffuse interstitial abnormality, likely reflecting worsening
 mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Decreased bibasilar minimal atelectasis.
 
 3.  No evidence of pneumothorax, status post placement of new right IJ central
 venous catheter.
