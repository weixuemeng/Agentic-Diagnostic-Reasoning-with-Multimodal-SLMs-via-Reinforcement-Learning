                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, to assess for hemorrhage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 increase in pulmonary opacification bilaterally, especially in the left mid
 and lower zones.  In view of the clinical history, this could reflect flash
 pulmonary edema related to fluid overload, possibly with secondary infection
 or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
