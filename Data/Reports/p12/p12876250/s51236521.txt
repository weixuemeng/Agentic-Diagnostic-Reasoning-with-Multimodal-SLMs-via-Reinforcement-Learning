                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia diagnosed at outside hospital. 
 Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes,
 with minimal infrahilar atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and there is mild interstitial abnormality.
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  A drainage catheter is noted in the right upper quadrant, with
 adjacent cholecystectomy clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary interstitial abnormality,
 which could represent edema or chronic thickening. Comparison with prior
 radiographs is recommended to aid in this differentiation.
