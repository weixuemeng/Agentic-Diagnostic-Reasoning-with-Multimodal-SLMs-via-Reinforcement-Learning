 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup on 4-mm nonspecific nodule seen on chest CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.

 FINDINGS:  4-mm nodule is not seen on this chest radiograph.  No outside CT is
 available for comparison.  If comparison is available, please upload and we
 will re-review the radiograph, although a 4 mm nodule is likely below the
 resolution of radiograph.  There are vascular clips in the right axilla. 
 Lungs are essentially clear, except atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
