                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sudden onset of abdominal pain and chest
 pain plus tender in the right lower quadrant.  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on
 the current exam.  Streaky left basilar opacities are most likely due to
 atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely within normal limits given low
 inspiratory effort.  Surgical clips project over the right axilla.  Surgical
 clip seen in the right upper quadrant.  Multiple air-fluid levels identified
 in the abdomen; however, there is no free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given limitation of low
 lung volumes.  Air-fluid levels identified within the abdomen raising
 possibility of obstruction.  No free intraperitoneal air.
