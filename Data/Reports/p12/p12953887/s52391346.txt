                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, malaise.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the right lower hemithorax likely relates to
 overlying nipple shadow.  Otherwise, no definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle right lower hemithorax opacity likely represent overlying nipple shadow
 which could be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.  No evidence of
 focal consolidation seen otherwise.
