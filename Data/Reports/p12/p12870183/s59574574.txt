                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for consolidation or effusion.  ___-year-old man with
 CLL, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large near-homogeneous opacity projecting over the left
 mid and lower lung which appears to be a combination of consolidation and/or
 loculated effusion; however, based on a single projection view, it is
 difficult to differentiate individual contribution.  Left upper lung and right
 lung are clear.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged since ___.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Bibasilar
 pleural calcification is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A large near-homogeneous opacity in the left mid and lower lung
 appears to be combination of consolidation and/or effusion; further evaluation
 with lateral and left lateral decubitus views may help.
