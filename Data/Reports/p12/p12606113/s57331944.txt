                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. 
 The mediastinal contour is unchanged. The patient is status post left lower
 lobectomy with volume loss noted in the left lung and leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures as well as postsurgical changes seen in the left chest
 wall. As seen on the previous PET-CT, opacification about the left hilar
 region appears grossly similar accounting for differences in modality. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects pleural thickening and
 appears unchanged. Patchy opacity within the right lung base is new, and could
 reflect infection or aspiration is not excluded. Known right middle lobe
 nodular opacity is poorly assessed on this exam. The right costophrenic angle
 is excluded from the field of view. There is probable mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. No pneumothorax is identified. Clips are seen projecting over the
 left lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New patchy opacity within the right lung base is concerning for infection
 or aspiration.
 2. Similar appearance of left perihilar opacity when compared to the recent
 PET-CT which could reflect post treatment changes, although residual disease
 is not excluded.
 3. Status post left lower lobectomy.
 4. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 5. Known right middle lobe nodular opacity seen on PET-CT which was concerning
 for malignancy is not well assessed on the current exam.
