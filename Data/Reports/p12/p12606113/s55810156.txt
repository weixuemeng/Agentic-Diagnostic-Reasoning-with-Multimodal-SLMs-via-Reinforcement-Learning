                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, presenting from
 dialysis with fever and tachycardia, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mediastinal shift to the left consistent with volume loss
 from the patient's prior left lower lobectomy.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is chronic and likely due to thickening or scarring of the
 pleura.  On the right, there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Known
 pulmonary nodular opacities at the right lower lobe are better appreciated on
 the CT from two days ago.  Bones are intact. Vascular clips are seen within
 the left hemithorax.  Aortic valve is calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right lower lobe pulmonary nodular opacities, better appreciated on the CT
 from two days ago, suggestive of an infectious process. No new pulmonary
 opacities identified.
 2.  Status post left lower lobectomy with expected left lung volume loss.
