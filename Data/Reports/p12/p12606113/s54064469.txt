                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral lung biopsy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications persist consistent with
 previous nodules and perhaps some atelectatic changes.
