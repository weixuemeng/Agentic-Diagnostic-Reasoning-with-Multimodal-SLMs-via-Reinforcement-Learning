                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the left lateral costal pleural sulcus could be due to small left
 pleural effusion or, more likely, pleural scarring. Previously fractured left
 upper rib has healed with a more physiologic orientation, than seen
 previously. Lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting emphysema, but clear of any
 focal abnormality. Heart size is normal. Vascular clips denotes prior surgery
 in the left chest.
