                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray for PICC line placement ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There has been
 interval removal of the NG tube.   Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is
 suggestion of a retrocardiac opacification which most likely represents
 atelectatic changes however in the appropriate clinical settings a
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable. The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely atelectatic changes however in the
 appropriate clinical setting pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Interval removal of the NG tube.
