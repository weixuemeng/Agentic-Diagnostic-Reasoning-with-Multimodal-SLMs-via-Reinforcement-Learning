                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The thoracic esophagus is diffusely distended and contains an
 air-fluid level within its lower thoracic portion.  Heart is upper limits of
 normal in size and demonstrates left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Lungs are clear except for a new peripheral patchy opacity at the
 left lung base.  There are no pleural effusions.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic findings to suggest active or latent pulmonary
 tuberculosis infection.
 
 2.  Distended thoracic esophagus with air-fluid level, suggesting esophageal
 dysmotility or achalasia.
 
 3.  New peripheral patchy left lower lobe opacity, most likely due to focal
 atelectasis.  Differential diagnosis includes focal aspiration and an early
 infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard if warranted clinically.
