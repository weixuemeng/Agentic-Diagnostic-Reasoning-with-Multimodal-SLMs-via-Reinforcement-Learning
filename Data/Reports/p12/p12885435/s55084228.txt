  Bilateral hazy lower lobe opacities are still present, although somewhat
  improved since the prior exam.  No new opacity, pulmonary edema, or
  pneumothorax.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions best identified on
  the lateral view.  Severe hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms from
  COPD.  Stable rightward deviation of the trachea.  Unchanged tortuous aorta.
  PICC terminates in the upper SVC.  Stable multi-level thoracic vertebrael body

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD, influenza, now required intubation, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided PICC line ends in upper SVC.  Patient is known with hyperinflated
 lungs and oligemia in upper lobes consistent with emphysema.  There are
 chronic bibasilar peribronchial opacities that are unchanged.  There is no new
 focal consolidation, no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no new lung consolidation suspicious for infection.
 
 2.  Chronic change related to COPD.
