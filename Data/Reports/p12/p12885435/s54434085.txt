                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is no NG tube seen in the imaged
 portion of the radiograph, potentially may be coiled in the oropharynx.  There
 are bibasal opacities, right unchanged and left increased since the prior
 study that might reflect a combination of interstitial changes and aspiration.
 No pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated.
