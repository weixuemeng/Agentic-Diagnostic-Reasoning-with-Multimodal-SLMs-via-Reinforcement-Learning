                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with COPD and cough.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions, associated with adjacent atelectasis.  Otherwise the lungs
 are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax
 or lobar pneumonia.
