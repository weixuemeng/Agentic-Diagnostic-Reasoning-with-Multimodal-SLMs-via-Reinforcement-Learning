                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, decreased bowel movements and diffuse abdominal
 pain with possible aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  CT abdomen and pelvis
 obtained earlier the same day at 11:  0 2.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.  Heart size is normal. 
 Aorta remains mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Hilar contours are
 stable.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is demonstrated within the lung
 bases.  Previously noted more focal opacities in the lung bases appear
 improved, likely reflective of resolved infection or inflammation.  Emphysema
 is again seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  Dilated
 loops of small bowel are noted within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved aeration within the lung bases with residual interstitial opacities
 likely reflective of chronic changes.  Dilated loops of small bowel within the
 imaged upper abdomen compatible with small bowel obstruction as noted on the
 prior CT.
