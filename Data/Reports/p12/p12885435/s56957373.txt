                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Right PICC has been removed.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is interval improvement in aeration of
 the lung bases, with no new focal consolidation demonstrated.  Previously
 noted tracheostomy tube has been removed.  The hilar contours remain
 prominent.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The left
 lateral aspect of the chest has been excluded from the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly limited study, but since the prior study, improved
 aeration of the lung bases with no new areas of focal consolidation
 demonstrated.
