                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  COPD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with lucency and attenuation of the pulmonary
 markings towards apices compatible with underlying emphysema.  The heart size
 is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary arteries could suggest underlying pulmonary artery hypertension. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Focal patchy opacity within the
 right lung base is new compared to the ___ exam.  Findings are
 concerning for infection.  Linear opacities within the left lung base likely
 reflects scarring or atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is loss of
 height of several mid and lower thoracic vertebral bodies which are age
 indeterminate.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Patchy right basilar opacity concerning for infection.
 
 2. Multiple compression deformities within the thoracic spine, age
 indeterminate.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 3. Emphysema.
