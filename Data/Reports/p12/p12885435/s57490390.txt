                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD and shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Subtle opacity in the lower lungs is most compatible with
 scarring, though a dedicated PA and lateral view may be obtained to further
 assess.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with presumed scarring in the lower lungs as compared with
 multiple prior exams.  If there is strong clinical concern for pneumonia,
 recommend a dedicated PA and lateral view to further assess.
