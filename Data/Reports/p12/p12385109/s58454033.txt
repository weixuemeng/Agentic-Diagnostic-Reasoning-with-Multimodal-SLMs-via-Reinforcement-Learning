                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with asthma, increasing SOB  // assess for
 infiltrate      assess for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and chest CTA ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in caliber of the moderate to severely enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette could be due to a combination of increasing mild
 to moderate cardiomegaly and progressive mediastinal fat deposition.
 
 The upper lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.  On the lateral
 view heterogeneous opacification projecting posterior to the heart could be a
 hiatus hernia.  I can't exclude pneumonia, but it is unlikely.  Oblique views
 might be helpful in making the distinction.
