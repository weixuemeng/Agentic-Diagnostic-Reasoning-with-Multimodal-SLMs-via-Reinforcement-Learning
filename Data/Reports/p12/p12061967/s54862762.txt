 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p liver transplant, fluid overloaded  //
 interval change?      interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change.
 Again there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Much of this
 represents pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude radiographically.
