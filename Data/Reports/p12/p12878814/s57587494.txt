                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CTs  // CT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved when compared to the prior study.  There is
 unfolding of the right pigtail catheter where it enters the pleural space. 
 There is improved aeration of the right lung however there is residual
 airspace opacity possibly reflecting re-expansion pulmonary edema.  Scattered
 air bronchograms are noted.  The left lung is relatively clear with patchy
 areas of airspace opacity in the left base.  The left-sided pigtail catheter
 is similar in appearance when compared to the prior study.  A tunneled right
 intern middle jugular catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the right lung and decreased in the right pleural
 effusion.
