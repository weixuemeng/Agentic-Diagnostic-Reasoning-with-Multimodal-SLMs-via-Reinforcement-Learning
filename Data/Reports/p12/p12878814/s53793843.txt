                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, fever, RLL crackles  // Eval for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right basilar opacity silhouetting the right cardiac margin. 
 There is also a retrocardiac opacity as well.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles bilaterally suggests persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right as seen on prior.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise unremarkable.  Right sided central venous catheter is again noted. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities potentially due to any combination of atelectasis or
 infection, slightly progressed since prior particularly on the left, some of
 which could be accounted for by lower lung volumes and technique.  Small
 persistent bilateral effusions.
