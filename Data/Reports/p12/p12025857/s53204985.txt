 thyroid nodule with associated deviation of the trachea to the left.  When
 compared to the chest radiograph dated ___, there is much
 decreased pulmonary edema with only mild congestive vascular changes.  There
 is decreased but still moderate pleural effusion at the right lung base with
 associated opacity, likely atelectasis.  The left lower lung opacity has
 decreased in size, also likely atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
