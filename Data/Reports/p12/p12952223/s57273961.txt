  Limited study due to the low lung volumes. Moderate right pleural effusion
  with adjacent atelectasis appears slightly increased. Small left pleural
  effusion likely present. Increased left basilar atelectasis, pneumonia must be
  excluded in the proper clinical setting. Right IJ tip may be in the right
  atrium but difficult to assess due to low lung volumes. A repeat radiograph is
  recommended when possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post aortic valve replacement. 
 Evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ central venous line with distal lead tip at the
 cavoatrial junction, stable.  There are extensive large pleural effusions,
 right side worse than left.  Atelectasis at the left lung base and poor
 inspiratory effort is again visualized.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  There is
 mild underlying pulmonary edema.
