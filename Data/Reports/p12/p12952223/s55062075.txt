                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema noted with perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present, left greater than right, with bibasilar airspace opacities. No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be excluded.
