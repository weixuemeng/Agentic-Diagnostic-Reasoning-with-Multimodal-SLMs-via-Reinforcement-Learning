                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post AVF.  Follow up pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volume.  Mild right pleural effusion is probably
 unchanged allowing the difference in position of the patient.  Small left
 pleural effusion is also unchanged.  Bilateral atelectases, larger on the
 right side, have increased on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by the pleural parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Left PICC tip can be followed to the mid SVC.
