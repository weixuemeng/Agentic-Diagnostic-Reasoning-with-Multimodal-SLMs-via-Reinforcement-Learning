                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement with right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ obtained at 6:14 p.m.
 
 Neither on the prior radiograph nor on the current study evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen on the right side.  The patient's head obscures the left
 apex and prevents assessment of that area.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 demonstrated, but there is interval improvement of pulmonary edema.  Dilated
 right upper mediastinal contours relate to tortuous vessel as depicted by
 chest CT obtained at 12 prior to the radiograph.
