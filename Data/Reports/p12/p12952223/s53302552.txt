                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AVR.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is extremely poor
 inspiration on the frontal view.  Opacification at the bases most likely
 reflects pleural fluid and atelectasis.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 difficult to assess, though there probably is some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
