                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes are present.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Thoracic aorta remains calcified.  There
 continues to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent streaky
 opacities at the lung bases appear slightly improved compared to the prior
 study, and likely reflect atelectasis.  There are adjacent small bilateral
 pleural effusions, though the size of the effusions appearing slightly
 improved compared to the most recent prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Please note that infection at the
 lung bases cannot be completely excluded.
