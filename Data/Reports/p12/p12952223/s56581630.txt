 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Urosepsis, chronic heart failure, evaluation for endotracheal
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been slightly pulled back.  It now projects roughly 3 cm above the carina. 
 The lung parenchyma has minimally increased in transparency, potentially
 reflecting improved ventilation or higher respiratory pressures.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  Unchanged evidence of mild fluid
 overload and cardiomegaly.
