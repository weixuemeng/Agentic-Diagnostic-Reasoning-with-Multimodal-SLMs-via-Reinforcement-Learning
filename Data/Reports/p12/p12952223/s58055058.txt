  ETT ends 2.8cm above carina. NGT follows expected course although tip is not
  seen. R IJ probably ends in region of cavoatrial junction. R effusion is
  unchanged to slightly decreased from 3:12pm. probably small left effusion.
  Bibasilar atelectasis and pulmonary edema are similar.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery with reintubation after respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube tip lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends
 to at least the mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin
 of the image.  Right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  Change in appearance of the right pleural effusion may reflect
 differences in patient position.  Bilateral atelectasis and pulmonary edema
 are essentially unchanged.
