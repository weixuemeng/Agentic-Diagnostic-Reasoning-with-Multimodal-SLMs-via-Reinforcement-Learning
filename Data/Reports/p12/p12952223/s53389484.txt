                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC line and repositioned Dobbhoff
 feeding tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 10:51.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.6 cm above the carina.  There has been
 interval repositioning of the Dobbhoff feeding tube which now has its tip
 projected over the stomach.  In addition, there has been interval placement of
 right subclavian PICC line, which has its tip in the right atrium.  Pullback
 of approximately 4 cm would be advised in order to position the tip in the mid
 to distal SVC.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with stable
 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There continued to be patchy
 opacities at both bases with some layering pleural fluid, likely suggestive of
 compressive atelectasis rather than bilateral pneumonia.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Calcification of the aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  The IV nurse, ___, was notified of the need
 for repositioning on ___ by phone at 1:10 p.m.
