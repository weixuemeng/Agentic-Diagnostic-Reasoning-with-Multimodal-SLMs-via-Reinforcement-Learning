                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asthma, presenting with cough and wheezing.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 There are low lung volumes on the frontal film with crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  There are bibasilar opacities that may represent
 atelectasis from low lung volumes, however, infection cannot be entirely ruled
 out.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is mild cardiomegaly, with slight
 unfolding of the aorta. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Low lung volumes crowd the bronchovascular markings.  There are bibasilar
 opacities that may represent atelectasis due to low lung volumes, however,
 infection cannot be ruled out.  If clinically indicated, repeat frontal
 radiograph with better lung volumes could help for further assessment. 
 
 2) No focal infiltrate seen elsewhere in either lung.
