                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Rheumatoid arthritis and atrial fibrillation presenting with left
 lower quadrant tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable including mild cardiac enlargement. A linear opacity projecting over
 the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis, but elsewhere, the lungs appear
 clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Upper thoracic
 interspaces again appear mild to moderately narrowed. Anterior osteophytes are
 moderate in size along several lower thoracic interspaces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.
