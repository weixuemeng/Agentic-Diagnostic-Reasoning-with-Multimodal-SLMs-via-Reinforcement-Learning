                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of trauma, multiple rib fractures to evaluate for
 interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Erect portable chest view was read in comparison with chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior radiograph from ___, endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  Left lower lung opacity which is likely a combination of
 mild-to-moderate effusion and left lower lung atelectasis has overall
 unchanged.  Right lung and left upper lung are clear.  Small right pleural
 effusion is also similar.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.

 and left pleural effusion and presumed small right pleural effusions are
 unchanged over last 24 hours.  No new opacities.
