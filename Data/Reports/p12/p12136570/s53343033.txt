                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, now intubated,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:14.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Markedly low lung volumes persist with interval removal of the
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  Right internal jugular central line
 and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.  Although there is
 crowding of the vasculature, there now is a component of mild perihilar and
 interstitial edema.  There is also patchy bibasilar opacity likely reflecting
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
 entirely excluded.  The patient's mandible obscures the apices.  No large
 pneumothorax is seen.  Probable layering left effusion.
