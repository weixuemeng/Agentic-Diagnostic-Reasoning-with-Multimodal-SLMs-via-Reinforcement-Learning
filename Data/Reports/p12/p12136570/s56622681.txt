                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip is within the stomach, however the side port lies within
 the distal esophagus, and the tube should be advanced for optimal positioning.
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal
 contours appear unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.  No displaced fractures are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 
 2. Orogastric tube tip within the stomach, but side port is within the distal
 esophagus.  Tube should be advanced for optimal positioning.
 
 3. Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
