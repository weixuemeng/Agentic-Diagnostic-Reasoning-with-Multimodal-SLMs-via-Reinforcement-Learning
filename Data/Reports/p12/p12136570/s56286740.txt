 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with massive pulmonary embolus after extubation,

 Lung volumes have improved, left pleural effusion has decreased, heart size is
 normal and mediastinal veins are no longer dilated.  There is some residual
 atelectasis at the left lung base, but this is the only radiographically
 obvious explanation for continued respiratory insufficiency.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC.
