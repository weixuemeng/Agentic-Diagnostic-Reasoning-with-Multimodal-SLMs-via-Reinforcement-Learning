 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube, terminating within the body
 of the stomach.  New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates
 in the region of the cavoatrial junction, with no visible pneumothorax.  Low
 lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures,
 limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities persist, and most likely represent atelectasis.
