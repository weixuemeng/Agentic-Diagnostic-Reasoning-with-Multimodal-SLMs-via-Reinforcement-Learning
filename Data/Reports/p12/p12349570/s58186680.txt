                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of slurred speech,
 history of cerebral palsy and seizures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lateral view
 is suboptimal due to low inspiration and some underpenetration, must be due to
 patient's body habitus.  Given this, no focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal lateral view due to low lung volumes.  Given this, no
 definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
