 evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no
 definite vascular congestion.  The upper lungs appear clear on the current
 study.
 The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen and there is some blunting in
 the costophrenic angle.  This suggests small pleural effusion and mild
 atelectatic changes at the left base.
