 The left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid to low SVC.
 The ET and nasogastric tubes are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The
 right basilar airspace opacity is more asymmetric today, and in the
 appropriate clinical context, infection or aspiration would be difficult to
 exclude.  A small right pleural effusion with bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis is unchanged.

 More asymmetric right basilar airspace opacity may be due to infection or
 aspiration.
 Stable small right pleural effusion and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
