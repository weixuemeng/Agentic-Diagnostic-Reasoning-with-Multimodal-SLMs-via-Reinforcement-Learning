 HISTORY:  Cough and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___; CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 right basilar atelectasis is noted with unchanged right hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation. Small opacity at the left lung base is due to mediastinal
 lipomatosis as seen on the prior CT. Heart size is normal.  Mild aortic
 tortuosity is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
