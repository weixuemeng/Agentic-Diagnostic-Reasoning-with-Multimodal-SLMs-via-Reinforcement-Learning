                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest view was read.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.  CT torso study dated ___ was concurrently reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right Port-A-Cath terminates at upper right atrium/cavoatrial junction. 
 Bilateral multiple pulmonary nodular opacities reflect metastatic disease to
 the lungs and if any of its component is represented by lung infection or not,
 is very difficult to determine based on the chest radiograph alone.  Heart
 size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no bilateral
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral multiple nodular opacities, left side more than right,
 may reflect pre-existing nodular metastatic disease, better assessed on the CT
 torso study dated ___ and if any of the opacities represent lung
 infection, is very difficult to determine based on the chest x-ray alone. 
 Appropriate treatment with followup radiographs will be helpful to assess for
 the interval changes if clinical concern for infection persists.
