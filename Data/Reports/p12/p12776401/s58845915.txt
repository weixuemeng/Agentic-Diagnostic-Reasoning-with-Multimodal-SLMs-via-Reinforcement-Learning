                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating in the right atrium.  Innumerable
 bilateral pulmonary nodules are again seen, given differences in technique,
 without significant interval change.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No evidence of
 free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bilateral nodular opacities again left greater than
 right, likely metastatic disease, better assessed on previous CTs, difficult
 to assess whether any these opacities represent lung infection on chest x-ray
 alone.
