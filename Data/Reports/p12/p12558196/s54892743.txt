 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:19 PM
  Compared to ___, right perihilar and left mid and lower lung opacities
  persist but are greatly improved. There is a small left pleural effusion,
  which was present on CT dated ___ but not seen on radiograph dated
  ___. Enlarged pulmonary arteries suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension,
  as seen on recent chest CTA. Interval removal of right internal jugular
  catheter. Lung hyperinflation appears increased, with increased peribronchial
  cuffing, suggestive of small airways disease with obstructive physiology.
  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 8:15 p.m. on ___ at time of
  initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 20:05.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with asthma, pneumonia, worsening wheezing
 and chest pain, evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 3:17.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 20:05, are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in airspace opacities within the right perihilar/upper
 and middle lobe and left mid and lower lobe suggestive of an improving
 pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.  Bilateral large pulmonary arteries
 consistent with known pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Coarsening of the
 interstitium bilaterally which likely reflects underlying small airways
 disease.  No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Interval
 removal of the right internal jugular central line.  No acute bony abnormality
 appreciated.
