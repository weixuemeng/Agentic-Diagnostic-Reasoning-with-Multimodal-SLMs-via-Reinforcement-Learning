  Right IJ catheter pulled back likely to the proximal upper SVC or the
  brachiocephalic vein.  To be safely in the mid SVC, would advance 3-4 cm.  ET
  tube 2.6 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube below the diaphragm with tip out
  of the field of view.  No change in bilateral parenchymal opacities. -___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Right IJ pull back.
 
 COMPARISON:  Yesterday chest x-ray and CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 ET tube ends 2.3 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line has been pulled back
 and is at the junction of jugular vein and superior vena cava.  NG tube is in
 distal stomach.  Right lung opacities with elevation of hemidiaphragm are
 unchanged, please refer to yesterday's CT.  Left lower lung opacities are also
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.
 
 2.  Bilateral opacities mostly in the right lung are compatible with pneumonia
 as shown on previous CT.  Right upper lobe increased density and elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm could be due to sequela from prior radiation therapy.
