                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chronic respiratory failure and tracheostomy with new
 desaturations.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___ and ___ CT.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated as before.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured
 by the lung abnormalities, but the size was normal in prior CT.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion is more conspicuous than before, likely due to
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Bilateral, right grater than left,
 post-radiation changes are unchanged.  In the left lower lobe, minimal
 opacities are likely atelectases.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. 
 Right PICC tip is in the low SVC or cavoatrial junction.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities.
