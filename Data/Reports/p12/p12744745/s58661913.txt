                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is similar compared to the prior exam. The aorta is
 tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, more
 pronounced on the left, which could reflect areas of atelectasis but
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated. There are mild degenerative changes
 noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left. These may
 reflect areas of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
