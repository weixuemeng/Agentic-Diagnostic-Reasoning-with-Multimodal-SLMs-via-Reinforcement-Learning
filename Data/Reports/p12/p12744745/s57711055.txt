                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 15:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with diverticular bleed, now with low-grade
 fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect upright chest film dated ___ at 15:40 is submitted
 for interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged despite patient rotation to the right on the
 current examination and this most likely reflects cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  The mediastinum also
 appears to be widened with a prominent aorta raising concern for possible
 aneurysm, although this could all be related to rotation.  Followup PA and
 lateral chest film as well as clinical correlation would be advised.  There is
 minimal overlying motion artifact on the current examination.  The lungs
 appear grossly clear, although lung volumes are low.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No large effusions are seen.
