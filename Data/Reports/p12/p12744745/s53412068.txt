                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___.
 
 There is a discrepancy in findings between the frontal and lateral view. 
 Lateral suggests small left lower lobe pneumonia, the frontal is more abnormal
 at the right base.  If localization is necessary, oblique view should be
 obtained, but the likelihood of basal pneumonia on one side or the other is
 quite high.  The upper lungs are clear.  The heart is normal size.  Very small
 right pleural effusion is seen on the lateral view.
