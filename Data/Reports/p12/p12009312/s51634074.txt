                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient status post cardiac
 operation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A series of chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates worsening
 bilateral moderate pleural effusions and atelectasis.  There is also worsening
 mild pulmonary edema.  Asymmetric opacification of the left mid lung field is
 present.  Post-operative widening of the heart and mediastinum are unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The sternotomy cerclage wires are intact and a
 right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter sheath remains in place.  Bilateral carotid stents
 are also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decompensated congestive heart failure as evidenced by worsening
 cardiogenic pulmonary edema and increasing moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2.  Asymmetric airspace opacification in the left mid lung field should be
 followed on subsequent examination to rule out developing infectious process.
