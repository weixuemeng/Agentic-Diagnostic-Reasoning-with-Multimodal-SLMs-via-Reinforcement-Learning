                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded with atherosclerotic
 calcification seen diffusely throughout the aorta.  The hilar contours are
 normal.  Linear opacities in both lung bases are compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is
 present.  There are multilevel moderate degenerative changes in the imaged
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
