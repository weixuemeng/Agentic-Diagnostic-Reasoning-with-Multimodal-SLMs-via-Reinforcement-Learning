                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Orogastric and central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:16 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 orogastric tube.  The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach and is correctly located.  An endotracheal tube and the right central
 venous access line are unchanged as compared to the previous examination.  A
 certain amount of pleural fluid on the right, pre-existing on the previous
 image, is now located in the apical regions of the lung.  However, the overall
 extent of the effusions on the left than on the right has not substantially
 changed.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
