                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for edema or infection.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube is 5.7 cm above the carina.  The feeding tube is seen
 passing into the stomach and below the field of view.  A right internal
 jugular line terminates in the low SVC. 
 
 Again seen are large bilateral pleural effusions.  The right pleural effusion
 is largely unchanged from the prior study and the left pleural effusion
 appears slightly increased.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 largely unchanged.  Evaluation of the deep parenchymal abnormalities is
 greatly limited by the effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Large right pleural effusion unchanged.
 
 2. Large left pleural effusion minimally increased since the prior study.
