                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-old female with pneumothorax and outside hospital chest
 tube placement, assess chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Contiguous left rib fractures involve at least
 the fifth through ninth ribs, several in two places, raising the possiblity of
 flail chest. A small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged over four hours,
 and a small left pleural effusion, presumably hemorrhagic to some degree, has
 accumulated, despite the small bore apical pleural drain.  Progressive
 opacification of the left lung base relative to chest radiographs performed 6
 hours earlier, is likely a combination of subpleural hemorrhage, atelectasis
 and pleural fluid.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Mild scoliosis is probably positional
 or otherwise unrelated to trauma, but if there are clinical findings related
 to spinal injury dedicated neurospinal imaging should be obtained.
 
 Dr ___ ___ these findings and associated thoracic findings on outside
 hospital CT timed at 22:37 on ___, by telephone with Dr ___, in the
 ___, at 8:30AM.
