 INDICATION:  Vomiting, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically expanded and well aerated without focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal
 in size.  The thoracic aorta is unfolded and tortuous.  As a result, the
 mediastinum appears prominent, but otherwise within normal limits.  The
 trachea is deviated to the right by the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
