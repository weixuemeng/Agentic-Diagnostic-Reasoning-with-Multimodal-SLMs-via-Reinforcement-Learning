  1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
  
  2.  Increased opacity the right lung base may represent atelectasis, but
  cannot completely exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical
  setting.
  
  3. Previously seen left lung base nodule similar or possibly increased
  slightly from in size from prior exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with c/o SOB  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, and ___, bilateral shoulder radiographs from ___, and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are increased interstitial markings throughout.  At the lung apices
 these changes may be chronic however they are now more apparent at the lung
 bases with associated ___ B-lines, and mild cardiomegaly.  Increased
 opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis, but cannot
 completely exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  The
 previous seen left lung base nodule is similar or may have possibly increased
 slightly in size from prior exam.  There is small left pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax. Median sternotomy and mediastinal clips clips are
 seen.  Degenerate changes in the bilateral humeral heads are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased interstitial markings compatible with chronic underlying
 parenchymal disease with suspected superimposed mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Increased opacity the right lung base may represent atelectasis, but
 cannot completely exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical
 setting.
 3. Previously seen left lung base nodule similar or possibly increased
 slightly from in size from prior exam.
