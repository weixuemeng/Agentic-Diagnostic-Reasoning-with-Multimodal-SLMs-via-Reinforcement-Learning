                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with dyspnea, fall  // eval for PTX, hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are persistent increased interstitial markings, particularly at the lung
 apices which correspond with centrilobular micronodules identified on prior
 chest CT.  Left base pulmonary nodule also projects over the cardiac
 silhouette, grossly unchanged.  There is no new consolidation or large
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Median sternotomy wires are noted as well as a coronary artery stent. 
 Degenerative changes partially visualized at the shoulders bilaterally.  There
 is possible right shoulder dislocation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic changes at the lung apices
 bilaterally and left base pulmonary nodule.
 Possible right shoulder dislocation.  Consider dedicated right shoulder films.
