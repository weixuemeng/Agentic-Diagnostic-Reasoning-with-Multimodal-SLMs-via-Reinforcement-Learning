                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT. 
 ___ PET-CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged.  The lungs are
 clear of consolidation, although a rounded nodular opacity at the left base is
 present again measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter.  It is stable compared
 to prior exams listed above.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; 2-cm left lower lung nodule is
 similar in size as compared to prior exams.  Prior PET-CT findings and long
 term stability suggest a benign etiology.
