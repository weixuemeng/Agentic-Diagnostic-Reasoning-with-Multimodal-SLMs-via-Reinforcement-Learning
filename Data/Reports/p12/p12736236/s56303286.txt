                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with 10 day hx of cough productive of green sputum,
 lethargy, remote hx of non-hodkins lymphoma  // Evidence of lymphadenopathy,
 infiltrates, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and abdominal CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chronic changes are seen in the mid thoracic spine with associated
 dextroscoliosis and changes in the adjacent ribs.  The right lung is clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Opacity in the retrocardiac
 region at the left lung base appears similar compared to multiple priors and
 is likely in part due to volume loss and elevation of the hemidiaphragm.  The
 superior left lung is clear.  Chronic changes are noted at the left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change since prior, no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
