                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with seizure  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Note is made of severe dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine as well as
 apparent fusion of several thoracic vertebral bodies and deformities of
 adjacent ribs presumably post traumatic, not significantly changed from the
 prior study. A retrocardiac opacity seen best on lateral view could possibly
 represent atelectasis however consolidation is also possible. The right lung
 appears clear. Again seen is opacity along the right hilum, not significantly
 changed in size from prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity may represent combination of atelectasis, effusion or
 possibly infectious consolidation.
 
 Opacity along the right hilus is not changed from the prior study, however
 further evaluation with non-urgent CT is recommended for further
 characterization of these findings.
