                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Moderate mid to lower thoracic
 dextroscoliosis is noted.  There is also apparent fusion of several thoracic
 vertebral bodies.  There is secondary asymmetry of the thoracic cavities. 
 Dense left basilar opacity could represent secondary atelectasis due to the
 bony changes although underlying effusion or consolidation is also possible. 
 The right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to
 assess.  Chronic changes seen in the proximal left humerus presumably from
 prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic bony thoracic osseous changes with asymmetry of the thoracic cavities.
 Left basilar opacity could be secondary to atelectasis given these findings
 although underlying effusion or consolidation is possible.  Additional imaging
 would be necessary to further assess.  Older exams should they become
 available, would be helpful.
