                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with seizure, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  There is a
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis;
 however, pneumonia is not excluded. Rounded opacity along the right hilus may
 represent a mass. There is pulmonary vascular engorgement without pulmonary
 edema.  Severe dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis is noted.  There is no left
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Deformity of the left humerus likely reflects
 sequelae of an old injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dense opacification at the left base likely represents a combination of a
 moderate pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis; however, infection is not
 excluded.
 2.  Rounded opacity along the right hilus may represent a mass and contrast
 enhanced CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 COMMENT: Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 9:45 am via telephone.
