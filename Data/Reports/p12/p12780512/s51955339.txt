                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lupus with abdominal distention and
 enteritis  // please assess for change in pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 19.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the
 stomach.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 There is new dense increased retrocardiac density, with new obscuration left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A
 small left effusion is likely present.  In addition, rim like opacity at the
 left lung apex is compatible with pleural fluid.
 
 On the right, there is new low opacity remaining the right chest wall, with
 more focal convexity in relation to the lung surface along the right lower
 chest wall.  The right costophrenic angle is obscured.  There is atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of
 CHF.
 
 Incidental note made of mild dilatation of a loop of small bowel in the mid
 abdomen (4.1 cm diameter).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Probable small left
 effusion.
 
 Rim like opacity along the right chest wall, with more focal thickening along
 the base of the right lung wall.  This most likely represents layering pleural
 fluid, configuration along the lower right chest wall raises question of the
 loculation.  This is similar to ___, but new compared with ___.
 
 
 Mildly dilated loop small bowel in the mid abdomen
