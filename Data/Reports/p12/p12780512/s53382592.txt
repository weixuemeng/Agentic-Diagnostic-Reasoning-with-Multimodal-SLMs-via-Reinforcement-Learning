 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 left chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Right chest tube remains in
 place with no evidence of pneumothorax.  The loculated opacification laterally
 on the right has substantially decreased.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is again seen with atelectatic changes above it.  On the left,
 there has been some decrease in the fluid collection, though retrocardiac
 opacification with obscuration hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 The new right subclavian PICC line has been removed
