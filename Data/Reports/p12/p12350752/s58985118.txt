                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, hypercalcemia evaluate for pneumonia or mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse ill-defined airspace opacities are present bilaterally.  Low lung
 volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. A more mass-like opacity in the right
 upper lung measures up to 2.6 x 1.9 cm.  There is a small to moderate left
 pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal airspace opacities may represent multifocal peribronchial pneumonia
 or multiple pulmonary masses.  Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Further evaluation with chest CT.
