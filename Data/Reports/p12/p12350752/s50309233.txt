                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with prior lung nodules, suspected sarcoidosis. 
 // Assess response to steroid therapy.      Assess response to steroid
 therapy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___.
 
 Over the past month there has been substantial involution of what was once a
 very widespread and very varied pulmonary abnormality.  Mass like lesion in
 the axillary region of the right upper lobe is now more like a scar, but
 medial to it is new consolidation which should be monitored to exclude
 pneumonia.  The previous widespread heterogeneous peribronchovascular
 abnormality in the lower lungs has improved and lung volumes have increased. 
 Heart size is normal.  No pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiographs in 2 weeks, sooner if the patient
 manifests acute pneumonia.
