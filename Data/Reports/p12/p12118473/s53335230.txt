                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a newly discovered lung nodule, in need of
 followup.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided pacer unit demonstrates leads in the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  A coronary stent is present.  The heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate
 calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The lungs are clear of
 consolidation.  In the lateral lower portion of the right lung, the previously
 described ill-defined nodular opacity is less apparent and sits over the
 intersection of tubes and bronchovascular structure, likely reflecting the
 superimposition of normal structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The previously described nodular opacity is less conspicuous on
 the current exam and most likely reflects the summation of normal overlapping
 structures.
