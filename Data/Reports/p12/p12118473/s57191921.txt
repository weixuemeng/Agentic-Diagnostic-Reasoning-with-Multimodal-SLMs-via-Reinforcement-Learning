 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating right atrium,
 right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus.  There is mild cardiomegaly
 with dense mitral annular calcifications.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 seen diffusely within the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal contour otherwise
 is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Calcified pleural plaques are re- demonstrated
 bilaterally and relate to prior asbestos exposure.  .  Patchy opacities are
 seen in the lung bases which may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
