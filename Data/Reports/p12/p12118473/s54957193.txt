                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Presyncope and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The heart is again
 mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a new vague nodular density
 projecting over the right lower lobe measuring approximately about 15 mm in
 diameter.  Otherwise, the lungs remain clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Calcified pleural plaque has formed along the apex of the right
 hemidiaphragm as before.  Small osteophytes are similar along the thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New vague nodular focus projecting over the right lower lung,
 which may represent a focal infectious process versus a true pulmonary nodule,
 which could be either of infectious or neoplastic etiology.  Atelctasis or
 consolidation are also possible.  Correlation with clinical factors is
 recommended.  Short-term radiographic follow-up is recommended within ___
 weeks in order to show resolution if an infectious cause is suspected. 
 Otherwise, chest CT could be considered.
