 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been removed.  A new platelike and a new retrocardiac atelectasis are seen,
 but these changes are subtle.  Overall, the lung volumes have minimally
 decreased.  There is no pneumonia.  The heart is at the upper range of normal,
 but no pulmonary edema is present.
