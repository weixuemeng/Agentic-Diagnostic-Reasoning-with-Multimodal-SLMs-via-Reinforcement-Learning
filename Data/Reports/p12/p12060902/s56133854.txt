                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Swallowed metal wire.  No longer in esophagus.  Evaluate
 for foreign body.
 
 COMPARISON:  Soft tissue neck radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Normal heart, lungs, pleural and
 mediastinal surfaces.  A faint linear density projects over the inferior
 portion of the right lateral eighth vertebral body and could represent the
 previously seen foreign body from the neck radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible visualization of the previously seen faintly radiopaque
 linear density corresponding to a metal wire in the expected location of the
 esophagus.
