                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings particularly at
 the lung bases.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process present.
