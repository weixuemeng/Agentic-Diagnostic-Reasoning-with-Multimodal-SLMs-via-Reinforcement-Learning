                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with palpitations
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary
 vascular markings towards the apices suggestive of underlying emphysema. 
 Linear opacities in the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflect areas
 of scarring.  Calcified granuloma is seen within the left upper lobe.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Probable emphysema.
