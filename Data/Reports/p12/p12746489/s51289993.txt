                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain following EVD, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  No evidence of
 free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains enlarged.  Lung volumes are relatively low and there are increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting mild-to-moderate vascular
 congestion/edema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen, which may
 relate to overlying soft tissue, although small pleural effusions may be
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles may be seen in small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Prominence of the vasculature suggests at least moderate vascular
 congestion.
 
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
