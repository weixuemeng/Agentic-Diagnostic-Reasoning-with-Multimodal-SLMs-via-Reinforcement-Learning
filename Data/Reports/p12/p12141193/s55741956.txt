                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is exaggerated as a result, and appears
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis.  Infection is not
 completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, is not completely excluded.
