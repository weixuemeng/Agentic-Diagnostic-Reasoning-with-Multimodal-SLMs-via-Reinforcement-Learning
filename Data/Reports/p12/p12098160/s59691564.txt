                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Tortuosity of the right mediastinal vessels
 is redemonstrated, slightly more prominent than on the prior scan.  There is
 unlikely possibility that part of this tortuosity may be lymphadenopathy or
 aneurysmatic dilatation of the aortic arch branches that if clinically
 warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered. 
 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  Mild compression fractures of the vertebral
 bodies are noted in part accelerated on the lateral view by the presence of
 scoliosis.  Herniation of the right hemidiaphragm is present.  Overall, there
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or focal consolidations to
 suggest infectious process.
