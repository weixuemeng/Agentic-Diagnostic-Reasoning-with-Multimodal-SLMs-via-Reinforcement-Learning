 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  There are increased interstitial markings diffusely, which may be
 suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures is present with multilevel degenerative changes identified
 in the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged is a right humeral head prosthesis. 
 Degenerative changes of left glenohumeral joint are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings diffusely may suggest mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
