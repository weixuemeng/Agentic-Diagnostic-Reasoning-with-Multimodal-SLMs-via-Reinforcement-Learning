  If the line projecting over the neck/upper mediastinum in the midline is the
  NG tube it is too high with the tip just below the level of the clavicles.  It
  should be advanced and a repeat radiograph performed.  Attention should be
  paid to possible developing opacity in the right midlung on subsequent
  radiographs.  Radiopaque stripe projecting over the right upper hemithorax
  extending into the mediastinum is likely a skin fold.  Mild cardiomegaly is
  unchanged.  
  
  The findings were telephoned to Dr. [___] by ___ at [19:15], 
  [___], [___ min] after discovery.

 a developing consolidation versus atelectasis at the right base.  There are no
 signs of overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothoraces are identified.
