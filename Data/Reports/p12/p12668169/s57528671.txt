 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:52 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was intubated.

 opacity on the left is unchanged.  Also unchanged is the right pleural
 effusion, with the effusion being distributed in a slightly different manner. 
 No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
