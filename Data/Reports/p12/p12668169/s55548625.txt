                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___, AT 8:30 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with alcoholic cirrhosis presents with
 confusion, abdominal pain, pleural effusion, now with increasing shortness of
 breath.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 17:45,
 ___ at 16:42.
 
 AP supine chest from ___ at 8:30 a.m. is just submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with associated
 consolidation in the right mid and lower lung likely representing compressive
 atelectasis although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  Given
 the contour of the right effusion, this suggests that at least a portion of
 the effusion is loculated.  Left mid lateral opacity overlying the left eighth
 posterolateral rib likely reflects callus formation related to a remote
 fracture.  Left lung is grossly clear.  The vasculature appears to be
 cephalized, but this may be related to supine technique.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.  No large left effusion.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to the diffuse process within the right hemithorax. 
 No large pneumothorax is seen although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
