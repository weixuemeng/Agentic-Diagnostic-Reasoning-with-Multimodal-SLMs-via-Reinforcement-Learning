                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary hemorrhage with lots of secretions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist. 
 This could reflect pulmonary hemorrhage, though some degree of vascular
 congestion should be considered.  Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
 basilar atelectasis persist.
