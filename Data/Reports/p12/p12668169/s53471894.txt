 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:27 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 projects over the proximal parts of the stomach.  The very extensive
 left-sided parenchymal opacities are unchanged, in the right lung, there is a
 slight improvement in ventilation, as documented by a decrease in extent of
 the basal opacities and basal pleural effusion.  No complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
