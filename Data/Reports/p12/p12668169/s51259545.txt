                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New cough, shortness-of-breath, cirrhosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but this is
 accentuated by the presence of low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Previously noted orogastric tube has been removed. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and the previous pattern
 of pulmonary edema has improved.  Small left pleural effusion has decreased
 from the prior study, and a probable trace right pleural effusion persists. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are no acute osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is now mild.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, also decreased in the interval.  Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.
