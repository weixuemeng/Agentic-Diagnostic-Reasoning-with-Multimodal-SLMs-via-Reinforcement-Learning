 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis, now with worsening cough
 and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low, with slight interval increase in pulmonary
 vascular engorgement, now mild to moderate. There is retrocardiac atelectasis,
 and an ill-defined right upper lobe opacity.  There is a small right and
 moderate left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, unchanged, and the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, with pulmonary vascular engorgement and small
 left greater than right pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac atelectasis. Ill
 defined right upper lobe airspace opacity, could represent developing
 pneumonia.
