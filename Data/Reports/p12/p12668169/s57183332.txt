                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 vascular crowding.  Despite this there is vascular congestion and probable,
 small bilateral pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity is likely due to
 compressive atelectasis. The heart size is large. No pneumothorax is seen. A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus and terminating off
 the image.  Previously noted left rib fracture is not well visualized on the
 current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Probable retrocardiac compressive atelectasis, though infection cannot be
 excluded.
