 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Known hepatic failure, presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large right-sided pleural effusion with balanced mass effect and
 probable associated atelectasis has developed since the prior radiographs. 
 The left lung remains clear.  The lateral view suggests a small pleural
 effusion on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.  A healed left posterolateral
 eighth rib fracture appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large new right-sided pleural effusion.
