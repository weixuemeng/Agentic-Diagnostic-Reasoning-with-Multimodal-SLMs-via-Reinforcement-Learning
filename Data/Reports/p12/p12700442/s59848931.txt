  ETT terminates in proximal left mainstem bronchus and should be withdrawn 4 cm
  for optimal positioning.  Low lung volumes with atelectasis of right lung and
  elevation of right hemidiaphragm, likely related to ETT position.  No
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.  Detailed
 evaluation is limited by overlying trauma board and numerous overlying
 external medical devices.  An endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal
 left main stem bronchus.  The right lung is atelectatic with an elevated right
 hemidiaphragm, likely related to ET tube position.  Low lung volumes
 exaggerate the heart size.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Multiple likely acute bilateral rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates in proximal left main bronchus.  ET tube
 should be withdrawn at least 4 cm for optimal positioning.  Right lung
 atelectasis and elevation of right hemidiaphragm are likely related to ETT
 position.  
 2.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures, likely related to resuscitation.
 
 Findings were paged to Dr. ___ at the time of study, which was the
 time of discovery, with subsequent reply page stating that the patient had
 expired due to unrelated causes.
