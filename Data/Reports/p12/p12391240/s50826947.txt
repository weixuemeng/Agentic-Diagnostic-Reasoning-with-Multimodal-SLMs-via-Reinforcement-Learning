                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right central venous line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central venous line terminates in the mid to lower SVC. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is
 increased focal density at the right lower lobe which could relate to
 atelectasis. However in the appropriate clinical setting and early infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided central venous line terminates at the mid to lower SVC.  No
 pneumothorax identified. Increased focal density at the right lung base could
 relate to atelectasis. However in the appropriate clinical setting an early
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
