                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure, ETT in situ. NGT
 placed, please confirm location, thanks.  // eval NGT placement     eval NGT
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 06:05
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and
 is coiled within the stomach. Endotracheal tube and right subclavian central
 line are unchanged in position.
 
 There is interval increase in bilateral airspace disease consistent with
 worsening pulmonary edema. Layering bilateral effusions are also again seen
 with associated bibasilar airspace opacity most likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours remain stable given differences in patient positioning.  No
 pneumothorax.
