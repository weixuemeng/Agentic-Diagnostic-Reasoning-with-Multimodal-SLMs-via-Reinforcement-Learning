 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:32 PM
  New enteric tube with tip in the stomach.  Right base opacity slightly less
  pronounced.  Left hemidiaphragm newly obscured, which may reflect a
  combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Infection not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abdominal nec fasc s/p debridement,
 remains intubated. New OG tube.  // Tube and line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an ET tube which terminates 4 cm above
 the carina. There is a new NG tube or OG tube with distal tip in the stomach.
 There is stable position of a right-sided central line with distal tip
 projecting over the lower SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The bilateral hila are not well
 visualized.
 
 The lung apices are not included on the current radiograph. There are
 bilateral more central and lower lobe predominant airspace opacities as well
 as indistinctness of pulmonary vascular margins, consistent with pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, though improved in comparison to
 prior radiograph.  There is increased retrocardiac and left basilar
 opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, as well as continued, but
 slightly less prominent, right lower lung opacification, probably representing
 bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 The left lateral CP angle is not clearly visualized, and may represent
 small/minimal pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New ET tube terminating 4 cm above carina. New NG/OG tube with tip in
 stomach.
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and interval improvement in still moderate
 pulmonary edema.
 3.  Likely bibasilar atelectasis. Possible small left pleural effusion.
