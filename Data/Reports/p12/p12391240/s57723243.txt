 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 13 11
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
 likely unchanged in position. The patient is markedly rotated to the left
 limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours which are probably
 stable. There are bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left ,with
 associated airspace opacity more consolidative in the retrocardiac region.
 This does not appear to be significantly changed. However, the superimposed
 pulmonary edema has improved with residual mild interstitial edema still
 present.  No pneumothorax.
