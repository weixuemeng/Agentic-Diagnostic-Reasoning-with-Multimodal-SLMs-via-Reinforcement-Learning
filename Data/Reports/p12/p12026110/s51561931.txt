                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with nausea and vomiting and chest congestion.
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ as
 well as chest CTA from to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Compared with the prior examination there has
 been interval resolution of multiple left lung opacities and significant
 improvement of right lower lobe opacities. However there is a residual small
 opacity overlying the right hemidiaphragm. No new opacities are identified.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval improvement compared with ___, with resolution
 of most bilateral opacities. Residual small opacity overlying the right
 hemidiaphragm may represent resolving infection/inflammation although new
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. Correlate clinically.
