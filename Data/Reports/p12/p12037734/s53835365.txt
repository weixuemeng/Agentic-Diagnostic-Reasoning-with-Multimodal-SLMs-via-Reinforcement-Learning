                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever x5 days right lower lobar ronchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Moderate hiatal hernia is redemonstrated
 along with medial right lower lobe opacity with air bronchograms consistent
 with pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable aside from a tortuous aortic contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia in the context of a moderate hiatal hernia suggests
 aspiration as a possible source.
