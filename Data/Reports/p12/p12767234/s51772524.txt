  New extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Assessment for
  pneumothorax is limited, though none is clearly identified. Increased
  interstitial alveolar opacities may reflect mild pulmonary congestion or
  active inflammation or infection superimposed on a background of severe
  fibrosing chronic lung disease.

 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:21 PM
  New extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Assessment for
  pneumothorax is limited, though no mediastinal shift is identified to suggest
  the presence of a tension pneumothorax. Probable mild pulmonary vascular
  congestion and bibasilar atelectasis superimposed on a background of severe
  fibrosing chronic lung disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with IPF, 8LPM NC at home with increasing dyspnea,
 sat ___% on 15LPM NRB  // eval ? pneumothorax, infiltrate, worsening fibrosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated.  New pneumomediastinum is present with extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema tracking into the neck and chest wall bilaterally. 
 Assessment for pneumothorax is somewhat limited given the presence of
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema, though no large pneumothorax is detected. 
 Lung volumes remain low with coarse interstitial opacities noted diffusely
 compatible with history of severe fibrosing chronic lung disease.  Heart size
 remains mildly enlarged with a small hiatal hernia again noted.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged with crowding of bronchovascular structures
 and increased interstitial opacities compared to the previous chest radiograph
 suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no shift of
 mediastinal structures.  Increased airspace opacities within the lung bases
 may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Retained barium is noted within multiple
 diverticula in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.
 2. Assessment for pneumothorax is limited, though none is clearly identified.
 3. Increased interstitial alveolar opacities may reflect mild pulmonary
 congestion or active inflammation or infection superimposed on a background of
 severe fibrosing chronic lung disease.
