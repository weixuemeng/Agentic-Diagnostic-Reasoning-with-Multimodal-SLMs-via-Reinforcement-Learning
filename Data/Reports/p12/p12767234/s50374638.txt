                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with IPF, worsening exertional dyspnea  //
 consolidation, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and mild elevation the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings, with a
 peripheral predominance, in this patient with history of interstitial
 pulmonary fibrosis.  The hila are somewhat prominent, and a superimposed
 vascular congestion/ pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No priors available for
 comparison to assess for interval change.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
