                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with IPF and worsening SOB and O2 requirement 
 // Evaluate for worsening infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present.  The tip lies immediately inferior to the
 right midclavicle.  He does not reach the SVC.  Today's image suggests that
 there is a loop in the PICC line immediately medial to the right chest wall. 
 In retrospect, the tip of the line is in a similar location on the radiograph
 from ___ at 15:13.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured,
 but probably overall unchanged.  Diffuse opacities are seen throughout both
 lungs, probably a combination of interstitial and alveolar opacity.  There are
 air bronchograms in retrocardiac region, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.  . Small effusions cannot be
 excluded as the costophrenic angles are obscured by the parenchymal opacity.
 
 Again seen is prominent subcutaneous emphysema about the neck and upper chest.
 Streaky lucencies in the region of the mediastinum could represent some
 residual pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line tip overlies the mid axillary line, immediately inferior to the
 right clavicle, within and apparent loop in the PICC line near the right chest
 wall.  The tip of the PICC line does not reach the SVC.
 
 Extensive parenchymal opacities, including evidence left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, are similar on the prior study.
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema and streaky opacities are also similar to the prior
 study.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The PICC line findings were discussed with Dr. ___,
 covering for the ordering physician, ___, M.D. by ___,
 M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 12:39 PM, 12 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
