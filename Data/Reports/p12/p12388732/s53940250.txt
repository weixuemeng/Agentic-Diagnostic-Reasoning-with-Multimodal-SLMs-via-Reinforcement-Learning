 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastrointestinal bleed, new orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  The nasogastric tube shows a normal course, the tube should be
 advanced by 5 cm, given that the tip projects over the proximal parts of the
 stomach and the side hole is located at the level of the gastroesophageal
 junction.
 
 The interstitial markings have minimally decreased in extent and severity. 
 There is unchanged cardiomegaly with a left pleural effusion and atelectasis
 at the left lung bases.  Signs of parenchymal opacities on the right persist.
