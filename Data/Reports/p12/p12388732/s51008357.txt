                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent extubation.  Please evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly, overall stable compared to the
 prior exam.  There is mild perihilar vascular engorgement, otherwise, the
 hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Again noted are small
 bilateral pleural effusions, overall stable compared to the prior exam.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis appears stable compared to the prior exam. There are new
 focal consolidations at the mid to upper lung zones bilaterally. There is a
 right-sided PIC line which terminates in the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New bilateral mid to upper lung consolidations. This could be secondary to
 aspiration; however, an acute infectious process cannot be ruled out.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at
 ___:___p on the day of the exam.
