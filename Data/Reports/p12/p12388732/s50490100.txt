                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of GI bleed complicated by respiratory failure.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be interval worsening of the bilateral perihilar
 opacities.  There are small stable bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis appears to have
 increased.  There is a right-sided PIC line, which appears slightly retracted
 compared to the prior exam; however, appears to terminate the mid SVC.  There
 is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight interval worsening of the mild bilateral perihilar opacities compared
 to the prior exam, likely secondary to worsening pulmonary congestion.
