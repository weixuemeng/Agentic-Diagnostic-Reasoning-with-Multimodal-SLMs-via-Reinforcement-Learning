                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 some re-expansion of the left lung with the mediastinal structures more toward
 the midline.  Substantial opacification persists in the mid and lower zones,
 consistent with collapse, presumably related to a mucous plug.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip remains in good position.
