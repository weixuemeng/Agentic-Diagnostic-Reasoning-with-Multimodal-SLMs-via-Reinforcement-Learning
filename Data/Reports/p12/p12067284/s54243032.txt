 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Anemia, short of breath, status post long plane ride,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate a
 retrocardiac opacity which could represent a hiatal hernia.  The lungs appear
 clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity which is most compatible with a hiatal
 hernia.
