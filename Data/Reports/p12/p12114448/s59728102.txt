                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumocystis pneumonia, presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There are vague medial upper lung opacities bilaterally with
 small lucencies suggesting air bronchograms but possibly lung cysts.  These
 may be due to the history of prior pneumocystis infection. There is also small
 focal retrocardiac opacity with cuffed basilar airways.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very vague medial upper lung opacities, which may be due to scarring from
 prior pneumocystis infection, including small cystic areas versus air
 bronchograms.  Active infection is difficult to exclude however.  However,
 small but focal retrocardiac opacity with air thickening may be due to
 pneumonia or lower airways infection or inflammation in the left lower lobe.
