                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Sick sinus syndrome and bradycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky opacity
 in the right costophrenic sulcus is most consistent with minor atelectasis,
 similar to prior findings, and a nipple shadow is visualized projecting over
 the right lower lung, as before. The lung fields appear otherwise clear aside
 from unchanged suspected minor left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The thoracic spine again curves mildly
 toward the left at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
