                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:38 as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique.  There is
 mild prominence of the interstitial markings, slightly increased as compared
 to the prior study, raising concern for underlying mild interstitial edema in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  The hilar vessels are again slightly
 prominent.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest mild interstitial edema.
