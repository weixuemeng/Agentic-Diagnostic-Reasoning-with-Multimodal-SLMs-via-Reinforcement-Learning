                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest trauma, to assess for injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  No gross evidence of
 rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 On one view, there is slight impression on the right side of the lower
 cervical trachea.  This raises the possibility of thyroid enlargement.
