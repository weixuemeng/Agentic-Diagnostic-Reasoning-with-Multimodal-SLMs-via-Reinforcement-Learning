                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent myocardial infarction, pneumonia with acute episode shortness
 of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is at least moderately enlarged, though difficult to accurately
 determine the size of due to the presence of a moderate right and small left
 pleural effusion.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration
 cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with moderate size right and small left bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration at the lung bases however is not
 completely excluded.
