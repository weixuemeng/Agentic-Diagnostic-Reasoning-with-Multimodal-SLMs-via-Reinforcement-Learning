                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate new central line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 00:57.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube in unchanged position with the tip in the distal
 esophagus.  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter is present
 with the tip in the mid SVC.  
 
 The opacity in the right medial base is improved.  There is no new opacity,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of the new right internal jugular central venous
 catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Unchanged position of the enteric tube with the tip in the distal
 esophagus.
 3.  Improving right basilar consolidation, which is likely atelectasis.
