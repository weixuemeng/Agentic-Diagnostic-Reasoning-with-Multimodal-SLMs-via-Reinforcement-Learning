                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Right IJ catheter again extends to the
 mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.  A relatively vertical area of opacification
 in the left base medially most likely reflects atelectatic changes.  No
 definite acute focal pneumonia.
