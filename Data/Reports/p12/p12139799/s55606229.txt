 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is streaky right basilar opacity projecting over the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Unchanged minimal opacity at the left costophrenic angle is
 noted.  Nodular opacity projects over the anterior left fifth rib.  Blunting
 of the posterior costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral effusions. 
 Right chest wall port is again seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
