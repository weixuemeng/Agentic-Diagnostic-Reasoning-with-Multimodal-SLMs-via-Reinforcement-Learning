                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, immunocompromised  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There relatively low lung volumes and the right costophrenic
 angle not fully included on the image.  Given this, no large pleural effusion
 is seen.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which could be due to
 atelectasis although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able for better
 evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Right costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. 
 Given this, patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis,
 but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Consider dedicated PA and lateral views, if patient able, for further
 evaluation.
