                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F PMHx HTN and prior ischemic stroke without deficits, who was
 transferred to ___ ___ after presenting to an OSH with acute onset nausea,
 confusion, and generalized right sided weakness with NCHCT revealing a L IPH
 with IVH  // b/l patchy opacities? interval change    b/l patchy opacities?
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The bilateral opacifications, especially involving the
 bases, are decreasing.  This could represent improving pulmonary vascular
 congestion with decreased layering effusions and compressive basilar
 atelectasis, though a more upright position of the patient could produce a
 similar appearance.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, especially on the right, it would
 be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
