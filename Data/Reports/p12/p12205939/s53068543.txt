                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well inflated.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
 pneumothorax detected.  Previously described left lung opacities have
 improved, but an opacity adjacent to the left heart border is likely residual
 from the earlier process.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Opacity adjacent to the left heart border is
 likely residual from the prior infectious/inflammatory process.
