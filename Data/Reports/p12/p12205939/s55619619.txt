                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension after colonoscopy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Patchy ill-defined opacities are noted within the left mid lung
 field.  Lungs are well inflated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle may reflect pleural thickening or scarring. 
 No large pleural effusion is noted.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No free air is identified under the diaphragms.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacification within the left mid lung field may reflect an infectious or
 inflammatory process.
