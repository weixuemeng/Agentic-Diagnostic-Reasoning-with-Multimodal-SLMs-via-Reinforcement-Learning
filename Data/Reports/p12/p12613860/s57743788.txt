                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post right upper lobectomy.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple postoperative radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent
 substantial subcutaneous soft tissue emphysema in the right lateral chest wall
 and deep cervical soft tissues.  There is marked increase in pneumomediastinum
 and pneumopericardium, raising question of a large bronchopleural connection
 including the right upper lobe bronchial stump.  A right basal approach chest
 tube terminates apically, stable in location. Previously seen right apical
 pneumothorax has decreased in size with a small residual apical pneumothorax. 
 The heart is top normal in size.  Dense retrocardiac opacity persists
 compatible with atelectasis.  A moderate left pleural effusion is persistent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Striking increased pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium in the setting
 of persistent extensive subcutaneous emphysema, raise question of a large
 bronchopleural connection/fistula including the right upper lobe bronchial
 stump.
 
 2.  Diminishing small right apical pneumothorax with stable chest tube.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ at pager #___ at 11:00 a.m. on ___
 via phone by Dr. ___ at the time of discovery.
