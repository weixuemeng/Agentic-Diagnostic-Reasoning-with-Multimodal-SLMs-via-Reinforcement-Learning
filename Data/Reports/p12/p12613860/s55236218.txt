                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion after thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 apical opacification on the right with atelectatic changes at the bases. 
 Better lung volumes are seen.
 
 On the left, there is extensive opacification at the left base extending along
 the lateral chest wall.  This suggests some volume loss combined with pleural
 fluid.  The possibility of loculation cannot be definitely excluded.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
