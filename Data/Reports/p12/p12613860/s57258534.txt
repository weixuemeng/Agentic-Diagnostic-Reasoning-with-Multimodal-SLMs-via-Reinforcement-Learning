                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post right upper lobe lobectomy.  Evaluate
 for interval change or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No significant interval change compared to ___.  The patient is status post right upper lobe lobectomy with
 unchanged right apical air collection and diffuse subcutaneous air
 collections. A right-sided chest tube is in standard position.  There are
 stable bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is slightly
 increased left sided mediastinal shift compared to the prior examination which
 likely reflects a combination of stable right apical air collection but
 slightly increased left pleural lower lobe atelectasis compared to the prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Stable right apical air collection.
 2. Minimally increased left sided mediastinal shift compared to the prior
 examination which likely reflects a combination of stable right apical air
 collection but slightly increased left pleural lower lobe atelectasis compared
 to the prior examination.
 
 
 No significant change compared to the most recent prior examination of ___ with stable appearance of right pneumothorax.
