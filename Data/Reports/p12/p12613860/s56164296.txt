                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post right upper lobectomy,
 assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is status post right upper lobectomy
 with corresponding elevation of the hilar structures and deformity of the
 pulmonary vascular pattern.  There is no evidence of a new mass formation. 
 Mediastinal structures with cardiac contours surrounded by scar formations
 unchanged, same holds for the detectable contours of the thoracic aorta. 
 Left-sided pleural scar formations along the left lateral chest wall remain
 unaltered.
 
 Comparison with the next preceding examination demonstrates, however, that
 there again was some increase of pleural effusion with more prominent blunting
 with fluid of the lateral pleural sinus on the frontal view.  Increased
 pleural density is also noted along the posterior right-sided lower chest wall
 coinciding with blunting of the posterior pleural sinus.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of increasing pleural effusion on the right side. 
 Considering the examination interval of six weeks, the progression of the
 right-sided pleural effusion is small to moderate.  Findings of left-sided
 hemithorax are stable and unchanged.
