                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Lung volumes are low with stable bibasilar
 opacities.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Probable post
 traumatic changes of the left shoulder are again seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities which are most likely atelectasis given low
 lung volumes. Pneumonia or aspiration are not excluded.
