                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate near
 complete resolution of right pleural effusion.  In comparison to the prior
 radiograph, there are slightly decreased lung volumes, accentuating the
 cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.  Otherwise, no focal
 consolidation is identified.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of right pleural effusion.
