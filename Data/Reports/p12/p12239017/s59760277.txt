                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation for altered mental status, rhonchorus breath sounds
 bilaterally.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine AP image of the chest.  There has been
 interval intubation of the patient, with the ET tube at the level of the
 aortic knob.  An NG tube is seen terminating in the left upper quadrant.  
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Diffuse right greater than left increased
 interstitial prominence is seen, most consistent with asymmetric mild
 pulmonary edema, though pneumonia could have a similar appearance.  No focal
 consolidation or mass is seen.  The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted,
 consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ETT at the level of the aortic knob.  
 
 2.  Diffuse right greater than left increased interstitial prominence, most
 consistent with asymmetric mild pulmonary edema.  
 
 3.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
