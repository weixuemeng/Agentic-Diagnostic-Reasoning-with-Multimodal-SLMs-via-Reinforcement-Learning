                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is
 rotated to the right.  Central pulmonary vasculature remains engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains moderate to markedly enlarged.  There is mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  A trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patient is rotated to the right.  Moderate-to-marked enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 3.  Areas of linear patchy bibasilar opacity most likely represent
 atelectasis.
