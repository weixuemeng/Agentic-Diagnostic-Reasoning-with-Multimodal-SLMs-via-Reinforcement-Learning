 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Probable background COPD.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Tapered appearance of the hila raises the question of pulmonary hypertension.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, probably unchanged.  Diffuse increased
 interstitial markings are likely chronic.
 
 No focal infiltrate or consolidation is identified.  No pleural effusion.
 
 Right apical pulmonary nodule identified on ___ radiographs is less
 apparent on the current study, but could be obscured due to overlying osseous
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Background COPD.
 2. Upper zone redistribution.
 3. No focal infiltrate detect to suggest pneumonic infiltrate.  No
 consolidation.
 4. Right apical pulmonary nodule identified on CXR from ___ is less
 apparent on the current study, but could be obscured due to overlying osseous
 structures.  Please see report from that study that suggested further
 evaluation with chest CT, if clinically indicated.
