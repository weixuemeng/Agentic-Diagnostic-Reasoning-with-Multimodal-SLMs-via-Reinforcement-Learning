                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread pneumonia persists throughout the majority of the right
 lung with relative sparing of the extreme right lung apex.  The presence of
 accompanying volume loss with shift of the mediastinum towards the right
 raises the concern for coexisting atelectasis, possibly on the basis of
 impacted airway secretions, particularly as there is no evidence of
 obstructing endobronchial lesion on recent CT of ___.  Within the
 left lung, recently described interstitial edema has resolved.  Small pleural
 effusions are again demonstrated, right greater than left.
