                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and ulcerative colitis,
 presenting with acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Additional relevant comparisons are
 radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is probably normal in size.  Although some areas of the
 right lung appear better aerated, there is overall new volume loss with
 moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphgram and rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures suggesting substantial atelectasis in the right lung. 
 Atelectasis may be primarily perihilar noting that there is more coalescent
 opacity associated with the right hilum over the short interval  A new area of
 right upper lateral subpleural opacification may be due to a loculated
 effusion but is not specific.  The left lung appears clear.
 
 IMPRESSON: Substantial new volume loss in the right lung associated with
 increased perhilar opacity which may be associated with infection or
 post-obstructive pneumonitis.
