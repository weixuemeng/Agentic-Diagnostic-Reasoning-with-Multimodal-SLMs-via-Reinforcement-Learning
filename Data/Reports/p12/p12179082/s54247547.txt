                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of non-small cell lung carcinoma with atrial
 fibrillation.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates near complete opacification of
 right hemithorax.  Degree of right lung aeration has significantly decreased
 since ___ exam with small asegment of aerated lung in the right apex
 remaining.  Left lung remains clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Cardiac size is difficult to
 discern due to adjacent opacities.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ exam, there is interval progression of right
 hemithorax opacification, which likely reflects combination of lung
 consolidation and pleural fluid.
