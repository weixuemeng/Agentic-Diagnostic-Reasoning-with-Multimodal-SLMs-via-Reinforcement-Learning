  Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited on this single portable radiograph; no
  definite pneumothorax.  Increased confluent opacities in the right mid-to-
  lower lung, most consistent with worsening infection, although an increase in
  size in the known moderate right pleural effusion could also cause this
  worsened appearance.  Left lung remains clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing
 opacification in the right hemithorax.  This is consistent with a combination
 of collapse, consolidation, and pleural fluid in a patient with a recent
 history multilobar pneumonia and underlying diagnosis of lung cancer. 
 Radiation pneumonitis may also be contributing to this appearance.
