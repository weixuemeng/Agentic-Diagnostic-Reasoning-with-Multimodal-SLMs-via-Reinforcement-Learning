 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of known pneumonia,
 failing outpatient p.o. antibiotics, please compare to prior.
 
 COMPARISON:  The most recent prior radiograph is from ___.  However,

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 had a chest CT one day prior.  Again seen is extensive right lower lobe grater
 than right middle lobe consolidation.  The decrease in size right lower lobe
 cavitary lesion is better assessed on CT, as is the new 5-mm nodular density
 in the right upper lobe, also seen on that study.  Mild left base atelectasis
 is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower and middle lobe consolidation.  Known right lower
