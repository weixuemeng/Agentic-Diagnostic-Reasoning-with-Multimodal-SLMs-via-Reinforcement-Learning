                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 Comparison to chest CT and chest radiograph exams dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Confluent opacity in the right perihilar region extends nearly to
 the lung periphery and is associated with marked volume loss with shift of
 cardiomediastinal structures to the right as well as marked elevation of right
 hemidiaphragm.  Though this appears similar to the recent study of earlier the
 same date, the degree of volume loss has markedly increased since an earlier
 chest x-ray of ___.  Cystic lucencies persist at the right apex. 
 Smaller cystic lucencies are also demonstrated in the anterior portion of the
 right lung in the retrosternal area and these probably correspond to areas of
 paraseptal emphysema on the recent chest CT exam.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion is partially loculated laterally, similar to earlier today, but the
 loculation is new from ___.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are
 clear.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Large conglomerate opacity in right juxtahilar region with associated volume
 loss is concerning for a postobstructive process, likely a combination of
 collapse and consolidation in this patient with recent history of multilobar
 pneumonia and underlying diagnosis of lung cancer.  A component of radiation
 pneumonitis is also possible if the patient has been undergoing such therapy
 within an expected time course for this complication.  Further evaluation with
 contrast-enhanced CT may be helpful for more complete characterization of this
 region, as well as to evaluate a loculated right pleural effusion.
