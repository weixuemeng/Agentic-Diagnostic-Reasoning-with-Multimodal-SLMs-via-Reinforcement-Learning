                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread pneumonia in the right lung has progressed and continues
 to spare the lung apex.  Small rounded lucencies within areas of consolidation
 could correspond to areas of spared lung and/or known underlying emphysema,
 but necrotizing pneumonia could produce a similar radiographic appearance. 
 Developing airspace opacity in left lower lobe could also represent infection.
 Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, right greater than left.
