                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall, laceration to the left eyebrow.  Question
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits aside from slight unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta.  Slight blunting of each costophrenic sulcus is
 indeterminate but could reflect tiny effusions.  The lateral view suggests
 interstitial changes, but probably mild, in the periphery of the posterior
 costophrenic sulci.  This may correlate with vague reticular opacities in the
 lower lungs on the AP view.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear, however. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized, but there is no
 evidence of fracture.  Degenerative changes involve the shoulder, where the
 glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints appear narrowed with prominent
 marginal osteophytes bilaterally.  There is mild rightward convex curvature
 centered along the mid thoracic spine with small osteophytes along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.  Findings suggesting mild interstitial
 abnormalities at the lung bases.  Possible trace pleural effusions.
