                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever, shaking chills, infection, pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The examination is technically limited.  There is blunting of the
 left costophrenic sulcus, suggesting a small effusion, new from prior study. 
 There is also evidence of increased lung markings projected behind the heart,
 with focal silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.  These could reflect
 atelectasis or pneumonia, but given the symptoms, should be treated as
 infection.  Lateral view is somewhat degraded due to motion artifact.  There
 are increased lung markings as previously noted in the lung bases.  There is
 also evidence of an unchanged dorsal kyphotic fracture with an acute wedge.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Increased markings behind the heart may reflect some atelectasis or perhaps
 pneumonia.  There is increasing effusion and probably background minor
 interstitial edema.  Unchanged thoracic compression wedge fracture with acute
 (approximately ___ degrees) angulation.
