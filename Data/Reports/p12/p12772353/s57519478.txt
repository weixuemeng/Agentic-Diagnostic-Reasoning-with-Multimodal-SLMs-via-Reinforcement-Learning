                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB  // pulmonary edema, hydro?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Previously noted consolidation
 in the right lower lung has resolved.  There is also been complete resolution
 of pulmonary edema seen on prior.  Lungs appear clear without focal
 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  There are areas of subtle
 nodularity projecting over the bilateral mid and upper lungs which could
 represent scarring or granulomatous disease.  There is no congestion or edema.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Subtle nodularity in the bilateral mid and
 upper lungs, could represent scarring or granulomatous disease.  Consider
 nonemergent chest CT to further assess.
