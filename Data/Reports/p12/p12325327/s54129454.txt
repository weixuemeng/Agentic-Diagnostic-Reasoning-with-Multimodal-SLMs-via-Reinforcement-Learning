                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man s/p OLT for HCV cirrhosis in
 ___, c/b recurrence of HCV in the allograft with resultant cirrhosis c/b
 splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, varices, who
 presented with confusion concern for hepatic encephalopathy, now resolved also
 with PVT s/p IR guided re-cannulization with new O2 requirement, evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The large layering right pleural effusion is difficult to compare with the
 immediate prior study of ___ given differences in patient
 positioning, semi-erect versus upright.  Allowing for the layering affect of
 semi-upright positioning, it is likely unchanged.  Low lung volumes cause
 bronchovascular crowding with minimal pulmonary edema.  There is no
 significant left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in patient positioning, likely unchanged large right
 pleural effusion.  Minimal pulmonary edema.  No consolidation.
