 INDICATION:   ___M with liver transplant presenting with leukopenia  //
 ?consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is blunting of the right lateral and posterior costophrenic angles
 suggesting small effusion.  Adjacent right lung base is also noted.  On the
 lateral view, there is a linear opacity projecting over the cardiac silhouette
 as on prior suggesting scarring.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits given low lung volumes on
 the frontal view.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion.  Adjacent opacity could represent adjacent
 atelectasis although infection would be difficult to exclude.
