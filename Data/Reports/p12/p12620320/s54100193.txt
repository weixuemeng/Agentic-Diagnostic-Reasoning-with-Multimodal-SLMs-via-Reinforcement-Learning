 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient's face mask and mandible obscures the apices.  No large
 pneumothorax is appreciated. Lung volumes are diminished and there are
 bilateral streaky opacities which may reflect areas of atelectasis. The
 central pulmonary vessels remain prominent which may reflect underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in positioning.
