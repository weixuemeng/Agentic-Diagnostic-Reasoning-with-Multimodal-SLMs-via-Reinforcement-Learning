 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PITS/PTTS  // s/p t-tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is not visualized.  The right PICC line has since been
 removed.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.  Lung volumes remain low.
 Bilateral platelike atelectasis is overall similar.  Low lung volumes gives
 the appearance of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, which is probably
 minimally changed from the prior exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette are
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube not visualized and interval removal right PICC line.
