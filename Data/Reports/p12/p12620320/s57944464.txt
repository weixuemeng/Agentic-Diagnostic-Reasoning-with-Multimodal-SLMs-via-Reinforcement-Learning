 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new trach  // ? ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, placement appears appropriate.  Apparent
 widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to patient positioning. 
 Even allowing for the projection, the heart is mildly enlarged.  There is left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. 
 There is hazy opacity in the left lung, likely reflecting pulmonary edema. 
 There is linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above
