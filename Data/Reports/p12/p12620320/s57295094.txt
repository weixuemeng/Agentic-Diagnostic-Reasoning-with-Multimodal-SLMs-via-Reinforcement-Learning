 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tracheal stenosis with T tube s/p bronch
 ___, pHTN, HFpEF with persistent hypoxia  // ?change in edema, consolidation 
 ?change in edema, consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there are relatively low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, significant pulmonary edema, and mild pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical
 setting it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
