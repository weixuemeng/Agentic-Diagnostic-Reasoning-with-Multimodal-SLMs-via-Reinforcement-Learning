                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  severe gastrointestinal bleed, assessment of nasogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube can clearly be visualized in the upper and mid
 third of the esophagus.  However, in the lower third of the esophagus and in
 the stomach, no nasogastric tube is visible.  This suggests that the tube
 should be advanced by approximately 12 cm.  After that, repeat radiograph
 could be performed.
 
 No other abnormalities.  Left pectoral pacemaker in situ.  Normal appearance
 of the lung parenchyma.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
