                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a persistent lower lingular opacification that appears
 increased and new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the prior
 radiograph and CT.  Background coarsening of lung markings suggests widespread
 chronic airway inflammation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including
 moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New volume loss and increased opacification at the left lung
 base, which may be seen with atelectasis associated with exacerbation of
 severe background chronic airway inflammation versus bronchopneumonia.
