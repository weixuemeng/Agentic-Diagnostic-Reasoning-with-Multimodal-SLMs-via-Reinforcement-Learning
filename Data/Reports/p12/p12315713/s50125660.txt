                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse interstitial markings are
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right is again seen,
 most likely related to scarring or chronic pleural thickening.  Tortuosity of
 the aorta is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No interval change and no evidence of acute pneumonia in this
 patient with findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
