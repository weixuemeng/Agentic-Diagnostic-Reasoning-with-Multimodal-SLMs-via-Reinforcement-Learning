                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right IJ placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 6 cm
 from the carina.  Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.  No other central
 venous catheter is identified.  There is complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift, compatible with bronchial
 obstruction and collapse of the left lung.  Emphysematous changes are noted in
 the right lung, without focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Marked gaseous
 distention of the stomach is seen, with a biliary stent partially visualized
 in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Complete opacification of left hemithorax with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures compatible with post-obstructive atelectasis of the
 left lung.
 
 2.  Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.  No other central venous
 catheter is identified.  No pneumothorax.
