 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:51 PM
  Increased opacity extending throughout the left lung with minimal lung
  aeration likely reflects tumor progression with overlying pleural effusion and
  atelectasis. Reticular opacities in the right lung could reflect metastatic
  disease. Further evaluation with a chest CT is recommended.
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:26 AM
  Increased opacity extending throughout the entire left lung, increased in size
  when compared to prior chest examinations and without significant change in
  position of the trachea, which could reflect increased size of previously
  identified lingular and left upper lobe mass. Superimposed infection however
  cannot be entirely excluded.  There is also likely a combination of pleural
  effusion and atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer with pancreatic mass who presents with
 generalized weakness.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest examinations, there is increased opacity extending
 throughout the left lung with minimal aerated lung, likely due to tumor
 progression. There is overlying pleural effusion and atelectasis. Scattered
 reticular opacities in the right lung could reflect metastatic disease.
 Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited. The trachea is midline. There
 is no pneumothorax.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacity extending throughout the left lung with minimal lung
 aeration likely reflects tumor progression with overlying pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Reticular opacities in the right lung could reflect metastatic
 disease. Further evaluation with a chest CT is recommended.
