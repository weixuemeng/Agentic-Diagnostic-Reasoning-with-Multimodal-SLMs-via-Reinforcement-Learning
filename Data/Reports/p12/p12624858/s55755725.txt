 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated common transfer from outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip
 approximately 6 cm from the carina and can be advanced several cm for optimal
 positioning.  Left-sided PICC is seen with its tip in the upper SVC.  There is
 complete whiteout of the left hemithorax.  There is no definite mediastinal
 shift.  This may be due to combination of underlying effusion and
 atelectasis/consolidation.  The right lung is grossly clear.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  Stent is partially visualized in the right upper
 quadrant.
