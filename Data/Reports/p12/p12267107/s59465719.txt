 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided AICD device is
 re- demonstrated with leads in unchanged positions.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are
 demonstrated in the lung bases.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the imaged thoracic spine

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.
