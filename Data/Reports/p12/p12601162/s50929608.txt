                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:
 Hoarseness
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In the mediastinum the contour of the aortopulmonic window is obliterated and
 on the lateral view there is greater than normal radiodensity projecting over
 the same region, raising the possibility of adenopathy, sometimes a cause of
 hoarseness. Chain suture in the right midlung denotes prior surgery. Lungs are
 otherwise grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette and pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.
 
 CT scanning, with intravenous contrast agent is appropriate for evaluating the
 upper pole of the left hilus and aortopulmonic window of the mediastinum.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 12:38 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
