 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are patchy opacities in both lower lungs,
 more extensive on the left than right, although nonspecific, compatible with
 aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy lower lung opacities, greater on the left than right, which
 would be compatible with aspiration or pneumonia.
