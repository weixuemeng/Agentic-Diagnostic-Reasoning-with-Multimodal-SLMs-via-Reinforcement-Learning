 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pulmonary opacity on recent chest radiograph. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and pre-operative

 vascular congestion and medial biapical opacities.  No confluent consolidation
 is identified.  There is no pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.  Current
 radiographic examination is similar to pre-operative exam from ___
 and is markedly improved compared to most recent prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of prior vascular congestion and apical opacities,
 which were likely related to prior edema.
