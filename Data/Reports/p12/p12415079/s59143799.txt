                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal
 size.  The aorta arch is calcified. The descending aorta is mild to moderately
 tortuous. Opacities at the lung bases can probably be explained by atelectasis
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Moderate degenerative changes affect lower thoracic and
 visualized upper lumbar spines.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy densities at the lung bases, most likely due to
 atelectasis.
