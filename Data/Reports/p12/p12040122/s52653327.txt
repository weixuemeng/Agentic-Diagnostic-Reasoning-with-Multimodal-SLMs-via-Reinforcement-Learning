                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI with bibasilar crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may contribute to
 the mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the aorta. 
 There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that would be consistent
 with the clinical impression of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
 
 Of incidental note is an old healed fracture of the distal right clavicle.
