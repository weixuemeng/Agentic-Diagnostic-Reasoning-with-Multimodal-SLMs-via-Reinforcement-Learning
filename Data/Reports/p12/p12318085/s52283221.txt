 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:45 PM
  Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with small amount of
  apical aeration and substantial rightward mediastinal shift, likely secondary
  to severe right lung collapse. Pleural effusion is likely also contributing to
  this opacity, which is progressively worse from ___ to ___ to today.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:41 p.m. on ___ at time of
  discovery of these findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: History of lung adenocarcinoma.  Currently undergoing treatment
 for hopsital acquired pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is new near-complete opacification of
 the right hemithorax with right-ward shift of the mediastinum consistent with
 severe of volume loss.  A small amount of aeration is noted in the right upper
 lung zone.  The known right pleural effusion and right basilar consolidation
 are difficult to visualize due to the collapse.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The left lung is clear.  The visualized left border of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with
 mediastinal shift is due to severe volume loss. The known right pleural
 effusion and consolidation is likely still present but not well evaluated.
 
 Results were discussed with ___ by phone at 8:41 p.m. on ___
 at time of discovery of these findings by Dr. ___.
