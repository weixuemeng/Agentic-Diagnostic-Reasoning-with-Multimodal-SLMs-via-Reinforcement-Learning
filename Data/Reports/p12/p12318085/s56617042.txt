                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, metastatic lung cancer, and presumed
 hospital-acquired pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior chest radiograph performed six hours earlier, there
 is improved aeration of the right upper lung zone.  The right-ward shift of
 the mediastinum has decreased.  In the newly aerated upper lung, interstitial
 prominence is present which could be lymphangitic engorgement or rexpansion
 edema.  Severe volume loss persists with an associated right lower lobe
 consolidation and pleural effusion.  The left lung is essentially clear.  The
 heart size is difficult to evaluate due to loss of the right heart border. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration in the right upper lung zone with decreased rightward
 shift of the mediastinum.  Interstitial prominence in the newly aerated lung
 may be due to lymphangitic engorgement or edema.
 2.  Right pleural effusion, right lower lung consolidation and associated
 severe volume loss persist.
