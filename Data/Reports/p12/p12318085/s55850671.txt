                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypercalcemia to ___, found to have
 diffuse bony metastatic disease, thought to be lung primary, now status post
 biopsy.  Developed fever overnight.  Evaluation for pneumonia or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the
 torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:   There is improved aeration of the right lower lobe and medial
 segment of the right middle lobe compared to the prior study.  Additionally,
 the right mediastinal border remains widened, due to previously demonstrated
 lymphadenopathy.  There is also persistent right juxtahilar mass with a
 postobstructive process involving the right upper lobe and part of the right
 middle lobe, unchanged since the prior study.  Persistent right pleural
 effusion. There is also a small left pleural effusion with associated left
 lower lobe atelectasis which is more prominent since the prior study.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral destructive bony lesions are again
 seen, and are better characterized on recent CT of the torso.
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 
 Right juxtahilar mass with postobstructive pneumonia/atelectasis.
 
 Improved aeration of the right lower lobe and medial segment of the right
 middle lobe.  
 
 Interval worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis with small left pleural
 effusion.
