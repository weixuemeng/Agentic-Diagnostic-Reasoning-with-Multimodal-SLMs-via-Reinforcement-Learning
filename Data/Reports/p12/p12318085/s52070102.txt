  Focal masslike opacification within the right lower lobe concerning for

  lymphadenopathy.  Further assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is
  recommended.

 HISTORY:  Progressive dyspnea and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Masslike
 opacification within the right lower lobe is noted with widening of the right
 mediastinal contour suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy.  Additionally,
 ill-defined nodular opacities are noted within the right lung.  The left lung
 demonstrates mild atelectasis in the left lung base.  Small amount of fluid is
 noted within the minor fissure, with possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal masslike opacification within the right lower lobe concerning for
 neoplasm.  Diffuse nodular opacities within the right lung may reflect
 infection or lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Probable mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  Further assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is
