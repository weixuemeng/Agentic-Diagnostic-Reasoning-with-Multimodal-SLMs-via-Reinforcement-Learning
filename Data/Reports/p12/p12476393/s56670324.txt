 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p endoscopy w/ n/v  // upright, free air
 chest or abd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and reference minute chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Streaky, relatively linear left lower lung opacity likely represents
 atelectasis or scarring.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle most likely represents atelectasis,
 less likely trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of
 free air is seen beneath the diaphragms. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal
 to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky relatively linear left lower lung opacity likely represents
 atelectasis and/or scarring.
 
 No no evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
