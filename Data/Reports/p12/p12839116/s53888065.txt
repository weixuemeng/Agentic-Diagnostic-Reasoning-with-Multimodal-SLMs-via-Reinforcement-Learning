                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged.  Opacity within the right
 cardiomediastinal contour likely reflects prominent epicardial fat and is
 unchanged from the prior radiograph from ___.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are noted.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Partially imaged are clips within the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
