                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope after chemo session, dehydration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Heart size is.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacity within the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  17 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the left mid lung field is demonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with patchy right basilar opacity which likely reflects
 atelectasis.
 2. 17 mm nodular opacity projecting over left mid lung field.  Correlation
 with any previous cross-sectional imaging is recommended.  If there has been
 no CT performed of the chest, then this should be further assessed with a non
 emergent chest CT.
