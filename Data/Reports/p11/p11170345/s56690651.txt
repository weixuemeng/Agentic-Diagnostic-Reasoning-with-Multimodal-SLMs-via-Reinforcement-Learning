                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain of acute onset.
 
 COMPARISON:  Ocrober ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The heart is again moderately
 enlarged, not necessarily changed, however, allowing for differences in
 technique.  However, some widening of the vascular pedicle including venous
 distention is suspected in system as well as pulmonary vessels. There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal opacity is identified
 aside from streaky mid lung opacity on the right suggesting minor atelectasis
 along the minor fissure versus fissural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probably unchanged cardiomegaly allowing for substantial differences in
 technique including AP versus PA view and low lung volumes.  Findings suggest
 pulmonary venous hypertension which is more striking than before, however
 without overt pulmonary edema.
