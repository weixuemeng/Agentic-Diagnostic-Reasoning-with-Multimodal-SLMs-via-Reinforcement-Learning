 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and cough, focal rales in right lung  //
 ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is a retrocardiac opacity which is most compatible with a large hiatal
 hernia. Coarsened lung markings likely reflects emphysema. No large
 consolidation effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size appears grossly
 within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is densely calcified. There is mild
 prominence of the mediastinum which likely reflect vascular ectasia as well as

 spine. There is a lower thoracic compression deformity which is seen only on
 the lateral projection with approximately ___ loss of anterior vertebral body
 height. Correlate clinically.
