                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged with marked mitral annular
 calcifications again noted.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device with
 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is calcification of the
 thoracic aorta diffusely.  Mild pulmonary edema persists.  Small left pleural
 effusion appears new compared to the previous exam.  Patchy opacity within the
 retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, similar to the prior exam, and new small left pleural
 effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
