                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the previous study, there is now an endotracheal
 tube in place with its tip only about 1.5 cm above the carina.  This
 information wasd conveyed to Dr. ___. Intestinal tube extends well into the
 stomach.  Left IJ catheter tip is unchanged.
 
 The extensive right apical lateral consolidation has substantially cleared. 
 The opacification involving much of the left lung has decreased.  It is
 unclear whether this represents clearing pneumonia or possible decrease in
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Opacification at the left base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion.  Right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour is elevated, possibly relating to pleural effusion, with streaks of
 atelectasis at the base.
