                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lungs with
 new hemoptysis and tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest was obtained.  Again seen is a
 partially collapsed right lung with increased density at the inferior border
 of the lung, consistent with pleural effusion versus pleural thickening. 
 Below the inferior border of the right lung is again seen a hydropneumothorax
 with an air-fluid level.  There again appear to be some small opacities within
 the partially collapsed right lung.  The left lung is seen again to be clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged chest radiograph from previous imaging.
