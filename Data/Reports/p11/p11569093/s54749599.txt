                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 There is still a large right pleural fluid collection, now with a smaller
 component of air, at the base of the right lung which is severely restricted
 by severe pleural thickening which has worsened along the costal and
 particularly along the right mediastinal pleural surface.  It would be helpful
 in our evaluation to know whether the nature of the right pleural effusion was
 infectious, malignant, are otherwise inflammatory.
 
 Left lung is well inflated and clear.  Heart is not enlarged.  Vascular clips
 denote prior surgery at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.
