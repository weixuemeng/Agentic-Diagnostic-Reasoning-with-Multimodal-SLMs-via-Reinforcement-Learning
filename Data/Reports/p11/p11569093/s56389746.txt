                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of antrectomy with Billroth II, with increasing O2
 requirement, concern for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the left IJ catheter has been
 removed.  There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions along with
 unchanged opacification of right lung base.  This suggests right middle and
 lower lobe collapse.   Comparison is limited by patient rotation on current
 imaging.  Opacification at the left lung base is unchanged, and pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
