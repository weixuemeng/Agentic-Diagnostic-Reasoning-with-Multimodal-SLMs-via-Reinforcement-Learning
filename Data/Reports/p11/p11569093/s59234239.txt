                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  DKA, post-ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 An endotracheal tube terminates 5.1 cm above the carina.  Again seen is a
 markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm.  There is mild central pulmonary
 vascular congestion with interstitial edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, larger on the right.  An orogastric tube extends into
 the stomach.  Since the prior examination, there has been worsening of
 mild-to-moderate interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminating 5.1 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube terminating
 within the stomach.
 2.  Interval worsening of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Unchanged marked right hemidiaphragm elevation.
