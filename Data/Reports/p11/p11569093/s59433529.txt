                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right PleurX catheter placement,
 evaluate tube position and assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple previous studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left lung is relatively well aerated and clear.  The right
 hemithorax is markedly opacified with volume loss, circumferential pleural
 thickening and pleural fluid with near complete opacification of the right
 lung with right basal pleural catheter noted. Hydropneumothorax previously
 seen is not as well evaluated on this not fully upright film. Cardiac contours
 are somewhat obscured but unremarkable.
