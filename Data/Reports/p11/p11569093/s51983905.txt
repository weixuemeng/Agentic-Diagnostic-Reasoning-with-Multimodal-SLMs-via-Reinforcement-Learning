                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates a markedly elevated
 right hemidiaphragm with adjacent compressive atelectasis or consolidation. 
 Minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle may indicate a small
 right pleural effusion.  Left lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal borders are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right hemidiaphragm elevation with opacification posteriorly
 suggesting extensive adjacent lung atelectasis, though cannot exclude
 developing infectious process.  Possible right pleural effusion as well.  If
 findings do not resolve on subsequent radiography, evaluation with chest CT
 could be considered, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible.
