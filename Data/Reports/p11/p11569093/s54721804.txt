                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post thrombectomy, low-grade fever, leukocytosis; question
 pneumonia, atelectasis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  This is a redictation of a prior dictation
 that apparently did not go through. 
 
 There is slightly rotated positioning.  Compared with earlier the same day
 (___:___ p.m.), there is progression of opacification of the right lung, with
 only a small partially aerated portion of the lung seen in the upper zone. 
 There may be some volume loss on the right, though this is difficult to
 confirm, due to rotation.  The left lung is grossly clear, with resolution of
 previously seen left base opacity.  No left-sided CHF, focal infiltrate, or
 effusion is identified at this time.Clips noted over lower mediastinum. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considerable interval increase in the degree of opacification of
 the right lung.  This may represent a combination of pleural fluid and
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Given the rapid change, is there reason to
 suspect mucous plugging?
 
 Findings discussed with the covering house officer, Dr. ___, at ~ ___:___
 p.m. on the day of the exam (___, phone).
