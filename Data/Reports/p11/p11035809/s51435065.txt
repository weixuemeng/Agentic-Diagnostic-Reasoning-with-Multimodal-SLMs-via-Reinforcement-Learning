                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Rule out complications from implantation of fiducial markers in the
 liver.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right apical lung lesion with
 fiducial markers has been present since at least ___, unchanged
 subsequently.  Left lung and the remainder of the right lung are otherwise
 clear.  Heart size is normal.  Heavy calcification is present in the mitral
 annulus and the aortic valve.  Clinical consideration should be given to
 hemodynamic significance of these lesions, particularly the aortic, although
 heart is normal size and there are no radiographic features to suggest cardiac
 decompensation.
