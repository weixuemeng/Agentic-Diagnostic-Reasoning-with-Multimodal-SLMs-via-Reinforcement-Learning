                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-obstructive pneumonia and pleural effusion with left chest tube
 in place.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  The
 left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 recurrent pleural effusion.  Increased perihilar opacification again is
 consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia.
 
 The right lung is hyperexpanded and clear and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion.
