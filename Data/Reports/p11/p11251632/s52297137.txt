 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with post-obstructive pneumonia, pleural
 effusion with chest tube in place.  Study requested for evaluation of interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, a
 left-sided pigtail catheter has apparently slightly changed in position.
 Left-sided pleural effusion demonstrates interval improvement with near
 complete resolution.  There has been interval increase of a left perihilar
 opacity, for which differential diagnosis includes post-obstructive pneumonia.
 There is atelectasis of the left lung base.  The right lung is hyperinflated
 and clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Near complete resolution of left-sided pleural effusion. 
 
 2. Increasing left perihilar opacity for which differential diagnosis includes
 post-obstructive pneumonia.
