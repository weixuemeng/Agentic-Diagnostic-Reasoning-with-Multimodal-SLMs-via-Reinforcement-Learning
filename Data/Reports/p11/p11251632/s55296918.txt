                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lung carcinoma, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size and
 mediastinal structures remain unchanged.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Seen on previous examination, residual air-fluid level in the
 upper pleural space has disappeared and apparently has been replaced by local
 minor pleural thickening in the apical area.  It is noted that the previously
 identified pulmonary abnormality presenting left upper lobe carcinoma has not
 progressed significantly.  On the lateral view, we can identify that the
 previously existing extensive pleural density in the dorsal pleural
 compartment has regressed and almost disappeared.  There is no evidence of any
 new left-sided pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.  The right-sided hemithorax
 remains unremarkable as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of previously identified left-sided pleural
 abnormalities.  Stable appearance of left-sided pulmonary parenchymal
 densities identified, previously as representing lung cancer.  Right
 hemithorax remains unremarkable as before.
