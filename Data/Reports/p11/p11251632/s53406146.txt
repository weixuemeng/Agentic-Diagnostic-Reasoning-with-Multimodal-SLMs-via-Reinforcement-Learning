                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage III left lung adenocarcinoma, known left upper lobe collapse,
 possibly post-obstructive pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 There is dense opacification of the left upper zone, most pronounced medially,
 consistent with known malignancy.  There is volume loss, with elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  Some increased patchy opacity is seen over the cardiac
 silhouette, suggesting increased volume loss.  The possibility of a
 post-obstructive pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.  Targeted evaluation
 of an outside chest CT from ___ at___ shows a small
 left effusion.
 
 The right lung remains grossly clear without focal infiltrate or effusion. 
 The mediastinum appears midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New patchy opacity superimposed over the cardiac silhouette could represent
 post-obstructive atelectasis and/or a post-obstructive pneumonia.
