                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, history of lung cancer and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___, chest
 CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Leftward shift of mediastinal structures is unchanged and due to volume loss
 in the left upper lobe.  Left upper lobe and left upper paramediastinal
 opacity is compatible with known lung malignancy and changes from prior
 radiation fibrosis.  Small to moderate left pleural effusion persists, but
 appears decreased in size compared to the previous exam.  The cardiac
 silhouette size also appears somewhat decreased compared to the previous exam,
 but remains mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or
 pneumothorax.  The right lung is clear.  Streaky left basilar opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette suggestive of decreased
 pericardial effusion.  Left pleural effusion also appears decreased in size,
 now small to moderate in extent.
 
 2. Unchanged opacity within the left upper lobe and left upper paramediastinal
 region compatible with known malignancy and radiation fibrosis changes.
 
 3. Streaky left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
