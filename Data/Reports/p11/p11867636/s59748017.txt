                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Pacemaker leads are unchanged
 in appearance.  Post-sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  A left lower lobe linear opacity most likely
 reflects atelectasis, slightly improved since the prior study.  Percutaneous
 biliary drainage catheter is in place.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, no
 substantial change since the prior study demonstrated with no radiographic
 findings that might explain patient's symptoms.
