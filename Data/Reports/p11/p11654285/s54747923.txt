                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fevers, cough sent from clinic for T101.2,
 tachycardia and possible left lower lobe rales, concern for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Focal opacification of the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia. 
 Linear opacities in the lingula and right lung base are compatible with areas
 of subsegmental atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is noted.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged and the heart size within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia with small left pleural effusion.  Followup
 radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of these
 findings.
 2. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended after treatment to ensure resolution of
 these findings.
