                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, dCHF, w/ dyspnea, wheezing this AM, resp
 distress, wheezing on exam diffusely w R lower posterior ronchi  // eval ?
 edema, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ PE
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is new compared to the prior exam and suggest
 presence of small pleural effusion.  Is probably also atelectasis. There is
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Heart size is probably a moderate to severely
 enlarged, even in the setting of low lung volumes and portable technique. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Severe pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is overall unchanged.  Right infrahilar opacity may reflect
 combination of atelectasis, edema.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded. 
 No pneumothorax.  Extensive aortic knob calcifications are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Findings most consistent with volume overload. However,
 concurrent infection cannot be excluded.  This patient could benefit from a
 chest CT non-emergently.
