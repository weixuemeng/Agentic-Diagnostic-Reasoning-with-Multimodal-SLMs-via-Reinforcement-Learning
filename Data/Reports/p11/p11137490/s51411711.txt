                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  History of TB, atypical microbial infection, COPD with
 wheezing and cough.  Assess for exacerbation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study CT ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Ill-defined opacity in the
 anterior segment of the right upper lobe mainly seen in the lateral view could
 correspond to an earlier infectious process.  Followup after treatment is
 recommended to assess for resolution.  There is mild central right greater
 than left bronchial wall thickening.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Mild degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
