 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post pedestrian struck by car with
 left rib and back pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The left lung is
 clear.  Subtle opacity is seen within the right lower lung which could
 represent loculated fissural fluid given its appearance on the lateral
 projection.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are noted.  Bony structures
 are intact.  Air-filled loops of large bowel seen beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fissural fluid, likely accounts for subtle opacity at the right
 lung base.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
