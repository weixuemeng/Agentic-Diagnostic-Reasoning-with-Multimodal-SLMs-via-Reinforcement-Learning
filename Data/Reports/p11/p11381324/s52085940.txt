                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with shortness of breath, evaluate for evidence
 of infection, effusion, volume overload, or emphysema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a thin linear radiopaque object within the anterior chest
 wall overlying the superior aspect of the left breast, which could possibly be
 related to a surgical procedure.  The right breast appears to be smaller than
 the left breast as seen on the previous study consistent with a history of
 lumpectomy and possible other interval surgical intervention.  Heart appears
 to be normal in size and configuration.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Lung fields are clear bilaterally with no evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.
