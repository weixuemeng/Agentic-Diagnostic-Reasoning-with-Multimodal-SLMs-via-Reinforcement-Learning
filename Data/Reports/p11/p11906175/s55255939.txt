                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are relatively low.  Lungs are clear except for a
 patchy right infrahilar opacity. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.
 
 There are no acute, displaced fractures evident on this chest radiograph, but
 lower ribs are incompletely evaluated due to overlapping soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, which may
 represent focal atelectasis or early pneumonia. Follow up CXR may be helpful
 in this regard.
