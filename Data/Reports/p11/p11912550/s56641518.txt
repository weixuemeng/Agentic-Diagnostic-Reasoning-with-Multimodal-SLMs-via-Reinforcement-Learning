 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  STEMI, pleuritic chest pain, leukocytosis, questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 decrease in lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid
 overload.  The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Relatively extensive retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis but no indication
 for pneumonia.
