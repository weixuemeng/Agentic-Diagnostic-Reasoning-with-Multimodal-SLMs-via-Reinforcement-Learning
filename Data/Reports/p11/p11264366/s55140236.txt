 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly and diffusely tortuous
 and likely dilated thoracic aorta appears unchanged.  New heterogeneous
 opacities have developed in the right mid and both lower lungs and may reflect
 multifocal atelectasis, with or without coexisting aspiration or developing
 infection. Small right pleural effusion is new.  Smoothly marginated left
 pleural or extrapleural opacity is grossly unchanged since ___ and

 PA and lateral chest radiographs prior to discharge would be helpful to allow
