                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fluid overload post-op, on vent.  //
 Please evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___ at 04:36.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 What was previously confluent and symmetric consolidation in both lungs is now
 more heterogeneous, and in some areas frankly nodular, with possible
 cavitation. These findings would be concerning for disseminated infection,
 either pneumonia or septic emboli.  However in light of the late provided
 history of massive blood aspiration and equally massive transfusion, we may be
 seeing the asymmetric clearing of aspirated blood in the setting of edema due
 to blood product administration.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have improved. ET
 tube and right internal jugular venous line are in standard placements and an
 esophageal tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ paged Dr ___  on ___ at 5:14 PM, 3
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
 
  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___, ___  by telephone on
 ___ at 5:24 PM, 13 minutes after discovery of the findings.
