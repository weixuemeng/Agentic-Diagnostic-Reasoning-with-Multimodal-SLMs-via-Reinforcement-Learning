                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:51 a.m.
 
 Left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  Tubing noted over
 left upper abdomen, not fully evaluated.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is minimal interval change.  Again seen are
 increased interstitial markings, with more confluent alveolar areas, likely
 reflecting CHF.  No gross effusions are identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.
