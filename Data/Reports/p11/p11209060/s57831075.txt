                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman, intubated  // Eval for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of a right IJ
 introducer and an enteric tube.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 3.7 cm above the carina. Within the lungs, there are diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, which likely represents pulmonary edema.  However,
 there may also be focal opacification of the right upper lobe, which is
 concerning for superimposed aspiration/pneumonia. The heart to is enlarged,
 which may be partially due to AP technique, but it has been noted as far back
 as ___.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of a right IJ introducer, enteric tube and endotracheal
 tube.
 2. New diffuse alveolar opacities, likely representing pulmonary edema. 
 Additional RUL opacity may be due to superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.
