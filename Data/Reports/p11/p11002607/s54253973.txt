                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new right IJ CVL  // eval right IJ CVL
 placement      eval right IJ CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle likely represents a small pleural effusion. There
 is atelectasis at the right lung base. Retrocardiac opacity and blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is also likely secondary to pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis; however, an underlying infectious process cannot be
 entirely excluded. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by
 bilateral opacities. No pneumothorax identified.  Surgical clips seen in the
 left upper chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. An underlying
 infectious process in the retrocardiac/ left lung base cannot be entirely
 excluded.
