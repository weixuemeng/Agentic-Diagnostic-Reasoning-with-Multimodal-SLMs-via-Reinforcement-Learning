                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new intubation  // Evaluate ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable ap view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph obtained yesterday at
 19:29.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal
 tube, which terminates 4 cm above the carina being in appropriate position.
 Additionally, a nasogastric tube is in place, coursing into the stomach and
 terminating beyond the field of view. Bibasilar streaky opacities and right
 upper lobe nodular opacities are unchanged compared to the prior study,
 compatible with aspiration or infection. Left mastectomy and partially
 visualized left axillary lymph node dissection changes are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriate positioning of monitoring and support devices, as described above.
 Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the chest since the prior study.
