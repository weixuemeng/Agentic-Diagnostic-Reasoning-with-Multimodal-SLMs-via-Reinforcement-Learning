 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Dobbhoff tube terminates in the stomach.  The left-sided PICC terminates
 in the superior-SVC.  Unchanged appearance of surgical clips along the left
 lateral chest wall.  Compared to the prior chest x-ray on ___, there
 are new bibasilar opacities, right greater than the left.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.

 New bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.  This is likely due to
 atelectasis and a small pleural effusion, but pneumonia should be considered
 in the appropriate clinical context.
