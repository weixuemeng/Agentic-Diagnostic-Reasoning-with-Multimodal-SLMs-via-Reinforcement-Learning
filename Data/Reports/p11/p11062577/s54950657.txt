                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bacteremia  // assess for infiltrate,
 pleural effusion      assess for infiltrate, pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragms is less prominent. This could well reflect a more upright
 position of the patient rather than definite improvement in pleural effusion.
 There is increasing prominence of interstitial markings, suggesting elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  The endotracheal tube has been removed. Central
 catheter again extends to the upper portion of the SVC.
