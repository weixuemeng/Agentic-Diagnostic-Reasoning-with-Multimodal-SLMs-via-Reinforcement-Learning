                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with loculated empyema s/p 2 chest tubes  //
 patient w/ new chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 2 chest drains are now in-situ in the right lung.  There is improved aeration
 of the right lung base although there is residual pleural fluid, the
 configuration suggests this is likely loculated.  Airspace opacity in the
 right lung base likely reflects atelectasis but consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax seen.  The left lung appears grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the right lung base with decreased pleural fluid however
 there are residual, likely loculated, pleural effusions.
