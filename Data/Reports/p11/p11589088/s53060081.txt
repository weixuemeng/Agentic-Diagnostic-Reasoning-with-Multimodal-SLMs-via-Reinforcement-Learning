                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  Incidental note is made of an
 azygos fissure consistent with a normal variant.  The aorta is calcified. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy left basilar opacities
 are probably due to minor atelectasis.  The right acromiohumeral interval is
 effaced, which often suggests rotator cuff pathology.  There is no obvious rib
 fracture.  Moderate degenerative changes affect the lower lumbar spine.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  The vertebral body heights appear maintained
 aside from mild probably chronic loss in height of an upper thoracic vertebral
 body.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
