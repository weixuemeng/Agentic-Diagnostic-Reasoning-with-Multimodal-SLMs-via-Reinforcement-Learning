                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Post-intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:02.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of
 the carina.  There has also been interval placement of an enteric tube
 coursing below the level of the diaphragm, extending into the expected
 location of the stomach in the left upper quadrant.  There is slight increase
 in prominence of the hila which may be due to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement/developing edema.  There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 
 Interval prominence of the hila increased since the prior study, may be due to
 pulmonary vascular engorgement/evolving edema.
