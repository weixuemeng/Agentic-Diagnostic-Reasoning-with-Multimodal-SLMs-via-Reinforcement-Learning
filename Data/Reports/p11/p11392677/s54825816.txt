                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New enteric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Enteric tube is noted traversing to the stomach.  Dual-lead pacemaker appears
 in place.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  In comparison to the prior study, there are bilateral
 increased interstitial opacities, consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis persist.  There is
 however increased opacification of the right lower lobe which may represent
 atelectasis versus an early infectious process. The upper lung fields remain
 clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable. There is no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach.  
 2. Moderate pulmonary edema which has increased. 
 3. Increased opacification of the right lower lobe which may represent
 atelectasis or an early developing infectious process.
