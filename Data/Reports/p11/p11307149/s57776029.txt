                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings and
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Given this, the cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged. There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles worrisome for
 small pleural effusions and/or basilar infiltrate. Moderate pulmonary edema is
 seen. The aortic knob is calcified and the aorta is likely tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities the, best
 seen on the lateral view, may be due to pleural effusions and/or
 consolidation.
