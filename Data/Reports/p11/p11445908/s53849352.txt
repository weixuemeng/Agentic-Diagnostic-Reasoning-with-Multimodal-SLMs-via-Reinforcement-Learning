                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with babesiosis and
 pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is slight interval improvement in
 widespread parenchymal opacities which might potentially reflect  improvment
 of pulmonary edema and persistent parenchymal consolidations.  Tubes and lines
 including the pacemaker are unchanged.
