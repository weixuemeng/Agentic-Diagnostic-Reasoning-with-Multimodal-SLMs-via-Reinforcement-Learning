                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of systolic heart failure.  Patient with fever and
 malaise secondary to babesiosis.  Please evaluate for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is a right-sided IJ which terminates in the mid SVC.  There is
 a pacemaker with the leads in appropriate position.  Again seen are diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal opacities which appear to demonstrate slight interval
 improvement compared to the prior exam.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidations
 concerning for infection are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in the diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities compared to the prior exam, likely reflect improvement of mild
 bilateral pulmonary edema.
