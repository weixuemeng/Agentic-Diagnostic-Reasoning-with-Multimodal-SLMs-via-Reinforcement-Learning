                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation of the chest prior to cataract surgery,
 here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, the inspiratory lung
 volumes are improved.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
 but stable.  The thoracic aorta is widened and tortuous, which accentuates the
 prominence of the mediastinum.  The mediastinal contours are stable compared
 to the prior ___ study.  The trachea is slightly deviated to the right by the
 aortic knob.  Prominence of the right hilum is unchanged and likely represents
 vessels.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are
 compatible with prior cholecystectomy.  There is exaggerated thoracic kyphosis
 with multilevel mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
