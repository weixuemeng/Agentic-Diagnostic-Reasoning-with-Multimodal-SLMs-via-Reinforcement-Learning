                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Hyperinflation of the lungs is demonstrated with flattening of the diaphragms.
 Interstitial opacities at the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly evident. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities. Chronic deformities of both glenohumeral joints are re-
 demonstrated with resorption of both sides of the joint as well as unchanged
 anterior dislocation on the right.

 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Findings suggestive of neuropathic joints
 involving both shoulders.
