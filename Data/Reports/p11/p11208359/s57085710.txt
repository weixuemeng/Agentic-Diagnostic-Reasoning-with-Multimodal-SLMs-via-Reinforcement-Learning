                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.   
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear
 of consolidation or effusion.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, likely progressed since prior. 
 Tortuous descending thoracic aorta is noted.  Chronic deformities seen
 involving the glenohumeral joints bilaterally, more significantly on the right
 where there has been resorption on both sides of the joint and possible
 dislocation.  This has appearance of neuropathic joints.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive failure.  
 
 Severe changes of the shoulders bilaterally with a configuration raising
 possibility of neuropathic joints, which in the shoulders can be due to a
 hydrosyringomyelia.
