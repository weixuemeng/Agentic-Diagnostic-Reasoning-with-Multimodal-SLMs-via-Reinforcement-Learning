 for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been
 removed.  Again there is substantial postoperative widening of the superior
 mediastinum with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is slightly less prominent, again consistent with pleural fluid
 and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Minimal pneumopericardium
 or pneumomediastinum persists.
 The right lung is essentially clear.
