 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SCHF with worsening respiratory distress,
 increased O2 requirement, not responding to lasix  // eval for PNA v.
 pulmonary edema     eval for PNA v. pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 06:30.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs remain well expanded and clear.  Heart is top-normal size.  Pulmonary
 and mediastinal vasculature are normal aside from an generally tortuous and
 possibly enlarged thoracic aorta.  No pleural abnormality.  Finding of
 progressive respiratory distress in the setting of a normal chest radiograph
 raise the possibility of substantial pulmonary embolus.
