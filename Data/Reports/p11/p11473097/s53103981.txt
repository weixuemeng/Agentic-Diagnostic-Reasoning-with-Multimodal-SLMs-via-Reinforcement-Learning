                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  The aorta appears unfolded,
 likely accounting for prominence of the mediastinum.  The lung bases,
 particularly the left, are underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue. 
 Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Prominence of the mediastinum is most
 likely due to an unfolded aorta, however, if there is concern for acute
 mediastinal process, chest CTA is more sensitive.
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
