                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Central line placement after recent sigmoid colectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates at
 the upper superior vena cava.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged, as before, and the patient is status post
 coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  There is new patchy opacification of
 the left lung base, suspected to represent a combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.  The right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of central venous catheter in the superior vena
 cava.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  New patchy left basilar opacification, not entirely specific but most
 suggestive of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
