                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent pneumonia, crackles on exam evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior radiograph, pulmonary vascular congestion
 has decreased.  Extensive interstitial opacities related to underlying
 interstitial lung disease could easily obscure small consolidations and
 determination of the presence or absence of an pneumonia would have to be on a
 clinical basis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Persistent interstitial opacities related to the underlying interstitial
 lung disease limit evaluation for pneumonia, and clinical correlation is
 recommended.
