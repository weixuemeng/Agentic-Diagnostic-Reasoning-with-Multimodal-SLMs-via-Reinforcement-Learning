                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain and syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist, the patient had some sort of shoulder injury and could
 not raise her right arm.  The right arm overlies part of the image on the
 lateral view.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
