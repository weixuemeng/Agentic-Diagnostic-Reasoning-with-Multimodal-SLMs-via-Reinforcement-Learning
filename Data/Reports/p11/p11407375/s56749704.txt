 HISTORY:  Patient with chronic cough, eval progression on chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 Again visualized are diffuse interstitial reticular markings, stable since
 study from ___.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable diffuse reticular interstitial lung markings consistent
 with chronic interstitial lung disease.  No definitive consolidation is
 appreciated.  However, given the severity of baseline disease, it is
 impossible to exclude a developing pneumonia.
