                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, cough, and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ in radiographs are ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged since at least
 the prior radiographs.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Lung volumes are low.  An interstitial abnormality appears increased since the
 prior CT, and in particular, there is prominent posterior basilar opacity in
 the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region.  Radiographs are more
 difficult to compare directly to the recent prior CT although the distribution
 of the background interstitial abnormality appears fairly similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased interstitial abnormality since prior radiographs.  Although an
 etiology such as mild vascular congestion or atypical infection could explain
 the change, since the distribution is very similar, worsening of a underlying
 interstitial disease is probably the most likely reason.
 
 2.  New or increased retrocardiac opacity.  Differential includes atelectasis,
 focal area of interstitial change and fibrosis, but possibly superimposed
 infectious process.  Correlation with clinical presentation is suggested.
