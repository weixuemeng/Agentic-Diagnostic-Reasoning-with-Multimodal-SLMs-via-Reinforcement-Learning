 VATs/wedge rsxn      Eval s/p R VATs/wedge rsxn
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The comparison study of ___, there are lower lung volumes that further
 accentuated transverse diameter of the heart.  Right chest tube is in place
 and there is no pneumothorax. There is vague suggestion of an area of
 increased opacification at the right lower lung laterally which, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, could represent a developing consolidation.
 Opacification at the left base most likely reflects atelectatic changes and
 possible small effusion.
 A small amount of subcutaneous gas is seen at the right base.
