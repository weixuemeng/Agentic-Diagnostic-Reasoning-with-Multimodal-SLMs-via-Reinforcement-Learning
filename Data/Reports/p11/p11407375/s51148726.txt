 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ILD, CHF  // Evaluate for interval change in
 interstitial opacities. Please take >8am
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 It is difficult to say whether the mild progression of moderately severe
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality compared to ___ is due to
 progression of the disease or con current mild interstitial edema. Mediastinal
 widening at the level of the mediastinal veins is long-standing due largely to
 fat deposition and some borderline size lymph nodes, so it is not fair to say.
 Mediastinal veins are distended. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. Pleural
 effusion minimal if any.  No focal pulmonary consolidation.
