 INDICATION:  URI symptoms with cough, dyspnea, and pain with inspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable hyperinflation, consistent with emphysema.  Since
 the prior exam, there is a worsening interstitial abnormality, which may
 reflect either mild edema superimposed on a background of emphysema or a
 progressive intersitial lung disease, such as fibrosis.  There are no focal
 airspace opacities to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged, very slightly increased from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality, worsened since ___, which may reflect
 new edema superimposed upon a background of emphysema or a progressive
 interstitial lung disease such as fibrosis.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
