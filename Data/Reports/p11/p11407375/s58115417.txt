                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent diagnosis of pneumonia, worsening shortness of breath and
 orthopnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been no
 significant change.  There is stable hyperinflation of the lungs.  Diffuse
 interstitial abnormality could reflect mild pulmonary edema superimposed on a
 background of emphysema or progressive interstitial lung disease such as
 fibrosis. Retrocardiac opacity seen in the frontal view, without definite
 correlate on the lateral view, is likely due to atelectasis. No new focal
 consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is tortuosity of the aorta.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable diffuse interstitial abnormalities as compared to ___, which may reflect mild edema superimposed on a background of emphysema
 or progressive interstitial lung disease. No new focal consolidations.
 Consider dedicated chest imaging for further evaluation.
