                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fevers and shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for
 an intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___ as well as
 CTA chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of an ET tube.  The Swan-___
 catheter is in appropriate position with the tip in the outflow tract.   There
 is stable mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild pulmonary edema.  There appears to be a more crowded appearance to the
 bronchopulmonary vasculature compared to the prior exam, likely secondary to
 poor inspiratory effort.  There is no pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen.  Note is made of a prosthetic aortic valve and median sternotomy
 wires.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  There appears to be a more crowded appearance to the bronchopulmonary
 vasculature compared to the prior exam, likely secondary to a poor inspiratory
 effort.
