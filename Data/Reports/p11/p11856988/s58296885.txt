                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lower extremity edema and increasing shortness
 of breath.  Assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unchanged
 hyperexpansion of the lungs, with new opacity seen in the lingula.  There is
 no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged, the mediastinal contours are normal with the exception of
 calcification of the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No CHF.
 
 2.  Increased lingular opacity likely atelectasis. As there is no explanation
 for this, further evaluation with CT is recommended to exclude an obstructive
 mass.
 
 Findings were entered into the radiology web-based results reporting tool for
 clinician notification.
