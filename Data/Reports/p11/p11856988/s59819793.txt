                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear,
 well-expanded lungs.  There is moderate hyperexpansion and lucency consistent
 with emphysema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal linear
 atelectasis or scar is noted in the left mid lung.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal, with calcification of
 the aortic knob present. Pleural thickening or effusion is present on the
 left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema. Atelectasis is a non-specific finding; the examination
 neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolus.
