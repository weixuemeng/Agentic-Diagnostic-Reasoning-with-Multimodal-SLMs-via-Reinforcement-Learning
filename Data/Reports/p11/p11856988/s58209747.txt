                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with bibasilar crackles and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpansion of the lungs
 and increased AP diameter of the chest, compatible with patient's underlying
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear opacities in the left lower lobe
 likely represent scarring.  Biapical scarring is also noted.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Aortic arch calcifications are
 present.  Heart is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
