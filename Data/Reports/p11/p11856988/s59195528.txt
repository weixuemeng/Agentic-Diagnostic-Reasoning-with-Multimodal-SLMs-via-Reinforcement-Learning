                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged and perhaps somewhat increased.  There is no
 clear evidence for pulmonary edema, however.  The chest appears hyperinflated.
 Irregular bronchovascular architecture and relative lucency in the upper lungs
 is suggestive of emphysema. There is volume loss and opacification of some
 basilar portions of the left lower lobe with a probable small pleural
 effusion.  There was mild scarring previously in the lingula but left lower
 lobe findings are new on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacification suggesting pneumonia.  Emphysema.
