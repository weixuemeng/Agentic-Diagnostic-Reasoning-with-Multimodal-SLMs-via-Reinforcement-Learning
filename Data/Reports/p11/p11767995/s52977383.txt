                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain, fever, currently on treatment
 for e. coli sepsis  // please evaluate for pulmonary edema, effusion and
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The distal aspect of a right-sided PICC is not well assessed, particularly on
 the lateral view ; on the frontal view appears to be overlying the
 brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No lobar consolidation is identified.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Distal aspect of right PICC not optimally assessed, but on the frontal view
 appears to overlie the brachiocephalic/SVC junction, not well seen on the
 lateral view.  Consider repeat lateral view if PICC position is of clinical
 concern.
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  No lobar consolidation.
