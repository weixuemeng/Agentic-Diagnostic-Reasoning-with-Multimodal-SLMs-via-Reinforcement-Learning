                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON: Outside hospital chest radiograph from the same day as well as
 radiographs from later on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is visualized in the lower trachea.  Minor
 atelectatic changes are noted at bilateral bases, greater on the left, and
 lung volumes are low.  However, the lungs are otherwise without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No acute fractures identified.  The
 aorta appears tortuous and mildly prominent in caliber.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tortuosity and prominence of the aorta, without short-term
 change.  If there is clinical concern for the possibility of acute aortic
 pathology, chest CT could be considered; correlation with more remote prior
 studies is also suggested.  
  
 Suggestion for chest CT discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
