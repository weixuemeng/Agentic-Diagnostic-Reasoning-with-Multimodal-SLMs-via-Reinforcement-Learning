                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of CHF, here with decompensated CHF,
 with asymmetric lung exam (suspect pleural effusion vs pneumonia on right).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation.  A moderate to large right pleural
 effusion is demonstrated with right basilar opacification, possibly reflective
 of compressive atelectasis though pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  Heart
 size cannot be determined due to the presence of the moderate to large right
 pleural effusion.  The aorta appears diffusely calcified.  Hazy perihilar
 opacification bilaterally is more pronounced on the right and may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Mild widening of the superior mediastinal contour
 appears relatively unchanged may reflect underlying lymphadenopathy, as
 demonstrated on the previous CT.  No left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly seen.  There is evidence of prior vertebroplasty of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Moderate to large right pleural effusion with right basilar opacification,
 likely compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.
 2. Bilateral perihilar hazy opacities, more pronounced on the right,
 potentially reflective of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
