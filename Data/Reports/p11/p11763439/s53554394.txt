                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with placement of chest tube  // eval for
 interval change in effusion s/p CT, ?PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph from earlier today, a right pleural
 catheter has been placed with decrease in size of right pleural effusion, now
 moderate.  No definite pneumothorax, but right lung apex is partially obscured
 and a small pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 improving aeration at the left lung base with residual small pleural effusion
 and adjacent atelectasis.
