                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. The lung volumes are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Findings are suggestive of
 underlying COPD.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is present, but improved
 compared to the prior exam.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly
 suggest trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation is present.  Wedge compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body, deformity of the right proximal humerus, and right sided rib
 fractures are again noted
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, somewhat improved compared to the prior
 exam, with trace bilateral pleural effusions.
