                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Past medical history of leukemia status post stem cell
 transplant, now with pleuritic right-sided chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CTA chest performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrated a right-sided
 central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 noted, right greater than left.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely corresponds with atelectasis when compared to same day CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications are most consistent with atelectasis.
