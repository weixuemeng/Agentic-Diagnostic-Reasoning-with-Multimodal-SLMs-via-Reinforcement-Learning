                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with end-stage renal disease.  Question
 pulmonary edema or effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 prominent, but likely accentuated by AP technique.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Lateral view is highly limited due to
 downcast arms obscuring pulmonary parenchyma.  There may be mild perihilar
 vascular congestion without frank edema.  There is no large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal perihilar congestion, without frank edema.  No pleural
 effusions.
