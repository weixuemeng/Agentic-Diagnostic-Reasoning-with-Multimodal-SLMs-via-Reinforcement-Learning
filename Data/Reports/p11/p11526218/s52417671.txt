                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 
 There is a new right infrahilar opacity, concerning for right middle lobe
 pneumonia.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt
 interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  The heart size is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms and increased AP diameter of the
 chest is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Linear
 hyperdensity over the left mid chest may reflect something outside of the
 patient as this is only seen on the frontal projection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable right middle lobe pneumonia
