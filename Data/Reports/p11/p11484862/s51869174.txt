  Compared with ___
  
  In comparison to the prior examination, small opacity in the right upper lobe
  seems to be less conspicuous.  There is stable left basilar atelectasis.  Lung
  volumes continue to be low.  Engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature is
  somewhat improved since the prior examination.  There is likely a persistent,
  small left pleural effusion.

 dvts recent urosepsis and perc nephrostomy with increased temp and
 tachycardia. Any acute pulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe consolidation has almost completely resolved.  Left lower
 lobe opacities have improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any there is a
 small left pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Vascular congestion has improved.
