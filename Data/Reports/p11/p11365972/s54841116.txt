  Endotracheal tube terminates no less than 2.6 cm above the carina. There is
  likely noncardiogenic pulmonary edema given lack of cardiomegaly. Correlate
  clinically for signs of ARDS. No focal airspace consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVC hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 2.6 cm above the carina.  Overall, cardiac silhouette is essentially within
 normal limits.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are most consistent
 with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Similar pattern could be seen in a
 patient with ARDS.  If there is evidence of HIV positivity, appropriate
 symptoms, PCP would have to be considered.
