 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post endocarditis status post tricuspid
 valve replacement and mitral valve repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP portable upright chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is worsening low lung volumes with increasing left lower lobe
 consolidation and atelectasis.  Right lung atelectasis, consolidation and
 effusions are seen again, largely unchanged.  There is stable cardiomegaly
 with no evidence of vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Pleural surfaces
 are unremarkable.  Sternal wires remain unchanged in position with no evidence
 of sternal dehiscence.  Tricuspid valve prosthesis is seen, unchanged in
 position. A left-sided PICC is seen appropriately positioned, terminating
 within the low SVC. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening left lower lobe consolidation and atelectasis.  Stable
 cardiomegaly with no evidence of failure.
