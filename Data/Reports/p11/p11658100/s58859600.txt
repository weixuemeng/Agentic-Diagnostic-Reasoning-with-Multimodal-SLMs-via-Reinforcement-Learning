                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with heart block, MVR and TVR.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates multiple EKG leads
 projecting over the thorax limiting underlying assessment.  The lung volumes
 are low accentuating a prominent cardiac silhouette which is likely
 accentuated by AP technique.  There are left greater than right bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents consolidation
 admixed with compressive atelectasis upon correlation with prior CT. 
 Scattered perihilar right greater than left opacities on correlation with
 preceding CT represent multifocal consolidation and cavitary sequela of septic
 emboli.  There is no pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires are in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  
 2.  Widespread bilateral consolidations and cavitary septic embolic lesions
 are better correlated on preceding CT dated ___.
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
