                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new permanent pacemaker and left
 ventricular lead via the coronary sinus, here to evaluate lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a left pectoral
 dual-chamber permanent pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right
 atrium and along the left ventricle.  The course of the lead is unremarkable
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and mitral valve replacement with wires appearing intact.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  The lungs show diffuse
 multifocal opacities predominantly in the left lung base and right perihilar
 region which are not significantly changed from ___ and may represent
 residual multifocal infection or scarring.  A lucent area in the left mid lung
 raises the possibility of a pneumatocele.  A small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged from ___.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left pectoral pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right atrium and
 along the left ventricle.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Persistent diffuse multifocal residual pneumonia or scarring.
 3.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
 4.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
