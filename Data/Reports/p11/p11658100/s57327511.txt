                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Endocarditis and respiratory failure, assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is 4.3 cm above the carina though likely further
 given the patient's kyphotic positioning.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the
 proximal stomach.  Right-sided Pleurx catheter is noted with persistent small
 left greater than right pleural effusions.  Multifocal cavitary and
 non-cavitary sites of consolidation are seen with unchanged opacification of
 right upper lobe and left lower lobe compatible with ongoing infectious
 process.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. ET tube more than 4 cm above carina and above the clavicles. Given the
 patient's positioning the tube likely could be advanced 2cm for improved
 seating. 
 2. Unchanged multifocal consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions.
