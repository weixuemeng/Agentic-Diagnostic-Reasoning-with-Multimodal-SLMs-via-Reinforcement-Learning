                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post tricuspid and mitral valve placement, now
 with new left chest tube, evaluate for effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of the left chest tube which has its tip at the apex. 
 Improved aeration within the left lung, although there continues to be a
 bilateral diffuse airspace process which is likely without significant
 interval change.  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right internal
 jugular introducer catheter, left subclavian central line and right chest
 tubes are unchanged in position.  Status post median sternotomy with valvular
 replacement.  Inability to assess overall cardiac and mediastinal contours due
 to the overlying airspace disease.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
