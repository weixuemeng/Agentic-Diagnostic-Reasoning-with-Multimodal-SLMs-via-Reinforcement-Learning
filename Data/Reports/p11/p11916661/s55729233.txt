                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AFib with RVR, new, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes limit the evaluation.  There are poorly defined opacities projecting
 over the bilateral upper lobes which on the lateral view appear to be
 pleural-based masses which are new from prior exam.  Findings are atypical for
 pneumonia and are concerning for malignancy. A calcified granuloma is again
 noted in the right lower lung.  No definite signs of overt CHF though mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema is present.  Heart size
 is difficult to assess though appears top normal to mildly enlarged.  Aortic
 calcifications are noted.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Pleural-based opacities projecting over the upper lungs are atypical for
 pneumonia and concerning for malignancy. Please correlate clinically and
 recommend chest CT to further assess. ___ d/w Dr. ___. 
 2.  Mild interstitial edema.
