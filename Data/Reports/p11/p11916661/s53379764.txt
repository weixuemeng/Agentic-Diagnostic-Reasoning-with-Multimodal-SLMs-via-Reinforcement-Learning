                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Assess for
 pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are again low and absence of lateral limits
 assessment.  Bilateral upper lung opacities are seen and more pronounced than
 on the previous examination.  On the prior study, they were suggested to be
 pleural-based based on their appearance on the lateral, although this
 assessment is not possible today.  Given that opacities have increased over
 time suspicion is high for possible malignancy.  Additionally,  subtle
 infectious process would be difficult to exclude in these areas.  Calcified
 granuloma in the right lower lung is again demonstrated.  The heart size
 remains top normal with calcified aortic knob.  Degenerative changes are noted
 at the right AC and glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in size of left greater than right upper lung, possibly
 pleural-based based on the prior examination, opacities for which further
 evaluation by CT is recommended.  Malignancy is of concern.
