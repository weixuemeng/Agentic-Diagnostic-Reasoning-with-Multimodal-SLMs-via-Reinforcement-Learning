                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath, wheezing, diagnosed at outside
 hospital with congestive heart failure and apparently improved with Lasix. 
 Assess for any evidence of residual CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a suggestion of left atrial enlargement without
 significant cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Lungs are clear without
 evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  Right lower lobe calcified granuloma and
 bilateral calcified hilar lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous disease.
 Small left pleural effusion.  There are multiple age-indeterminate vertebral
 compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely left atrial enlargement.  No overt pulmonary edema. Small
 left pleural effusion. Multiple age-indeterminate vertebral compression
 fractures.
