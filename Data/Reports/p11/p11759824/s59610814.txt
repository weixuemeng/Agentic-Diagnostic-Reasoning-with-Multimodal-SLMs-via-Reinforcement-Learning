                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:27 ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion following thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small volume of left pleural effusion has recurred following left
 thoracentesis.  I do not believe there is any pneumothorax, although a skin
 fold simulates a pleural edge.  Multiple nodular opacities have stabilized in
 size in the better inflated left lung, but now the nodules in the right lung
 are more obvious than they were previously, either multiple pulmonary
 metastases or disseminated infection, including septic emboli.
