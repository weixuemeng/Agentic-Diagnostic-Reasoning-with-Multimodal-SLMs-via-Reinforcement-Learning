 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, lethargy, decreased breath sounds at

 large left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis in the
 left mid and lower lung.  There is aeration in the left upper lobe.  The right
 lung is clear.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is notable
 for a densely calcified aortic knob.  Bony structures are intact.

 atelectasis.  Please note underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Recommend
