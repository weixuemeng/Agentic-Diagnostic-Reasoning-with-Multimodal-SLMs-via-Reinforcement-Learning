                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left rib fractures status post bike accident,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  No consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema is seen, and
 the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Left midclavicular fracture
 is seen.  Oblique stepoff of the left lateral chest wall is seen, likely to be
 associated with previously documented rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left midclavicular fracture.  Left lateral chest wall  oblique
 stepoff is likely secondary to rib fractures.  Recommend oblique views for
 further and better evaluation.
