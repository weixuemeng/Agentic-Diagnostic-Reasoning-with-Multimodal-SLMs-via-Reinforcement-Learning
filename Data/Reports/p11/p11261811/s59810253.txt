                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:21 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CAD status post stents and ERCP, now
 with acute shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison to prior study from___ dated ___ at 23:26.
 
 AP portable upright chest film ___ at 3:21 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Interval appearance of
 patchy bibasilar opacities which may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration
 or pneumonia should also be considered.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  More focal 1.4 cm nodular opacity in the left hilar region is
 felt to most likely be vascular in etiology.  However, this can be better
 assessed on followup imaging.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
