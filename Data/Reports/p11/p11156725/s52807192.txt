                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke  // ?PNA      ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No prior chest radiographs are available for review.
 
 Heart size is only top-normal but the left heart border configuration suggests
 substantial left atrial enlargement.  Lungs fully expanded and generally
 clear.  Minimal interstitial septal thickening at the base of the right lung
 is of uncertain chronicity, but I doubt these acute pulmonary edema.  Pleural
 effusion minimal if any.
