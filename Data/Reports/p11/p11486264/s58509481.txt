                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with oxygen desaturation, evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___ at 16:11.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Sternotomy wires are midline and intact. 
 Surgical clips are noted along the left mediastinum.  Bilateral low lung
 volumes are noted with accentuation of the cardiac silhouette.  Bibasilar
 opacifications are increased since the prior examination and are most likely
 atelectasis. Opacification at the right medial lung base most likely
 represents aspiration versus pneumonia, more prominent on today's study
 compared to the most recent prior examination. Pleural plaques are again
 noted.
