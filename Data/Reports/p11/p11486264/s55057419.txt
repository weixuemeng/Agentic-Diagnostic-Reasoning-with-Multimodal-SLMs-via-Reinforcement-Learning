                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected aspiration in a patient with history of
 glioblastoma.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Overall, there is no substantial change in appearance of the heart size and
 mediastinal silhouettes as well as bilateral pleural calcified plaques.  There
 is elevation of right hemidiaphragm with new opacity in the right lower lung,
 most likely representing atelectasis but aspiration of the right lower lobe is
 a suitable possibility.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
