                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacities projecting over the left chest appear geographic and most
 suggestive of pleural plaques, unchanged since the earliest radiographs
 available.  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The lung volumes are low.  The right major fissure appears thickened.  It is
 also difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on the right.  The right
 hemidiaphragm shows similar mild elevation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
