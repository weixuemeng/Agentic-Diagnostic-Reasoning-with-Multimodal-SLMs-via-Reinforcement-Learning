                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R sided CP s/p assault  // fracture?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or evidence of pulmonary edema.  Imaged
 osseous structures are without evidence of an acute fracture.  Metallic
 density is noted within the subcutaneous tissues of the left lateral chest
 wall.  No air is seen under the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intra thoracic abnormality.  If clinical concern for rib fracture
 persists, dedicated rib pelvis with radiopaque marker can be performed.  No
 displaced rib fracture is identified.
