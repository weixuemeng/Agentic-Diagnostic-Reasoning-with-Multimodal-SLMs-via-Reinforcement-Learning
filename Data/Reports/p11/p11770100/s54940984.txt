                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of pneumonia,
 for followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is a resolution of right and left lower lobe
 consolidations as well as right upper lobe opacities.  Minimal amount of
 pleural thickening is remaining.  The lateral view re-demonstrates, better
 appreciated currently, multiple wedge compression fractures.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
