                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
  CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged. Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis
 with a trace left pleural effusion, similar compared to the previous exam.  No
 new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel compression
 deformities are again seen in the thoracic spine, unchanged, along with
 multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of small left pleural effusion with left basilar streaky
 opacity, likely atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
