                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cystic fibrosis and pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___ and radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the recent chest CT, there are similar chronic findings of cystic
 fibrosis with bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and nodular opacities
 in the upper lobes of both lungs.  The nodular density abutting the pleura in
 the left lower lobe is visualized on the radiograph but best characterized on
 the recent chest CT.  There is no new focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
