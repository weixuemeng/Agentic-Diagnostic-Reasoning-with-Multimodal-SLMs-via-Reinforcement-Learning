                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cystic fibrosis, with cough, shortness of
 breath // Any acute infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Available..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs
 with dilated, thickened bronchi, worse centrally and in the bilateral upper
 lobes and the superior segment of the left lower lobe. These findings are
 consistent with chronic changes of cystic fibrosis. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no superimposed pneumothorax, focal
 consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bronchiectasis consistent with chronic changes of cystic fibrosis.
 Comparison to prior radiographs would be useful to evaluate change from
 baseline.
