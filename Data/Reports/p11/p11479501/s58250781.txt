                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cystic fibrosis status post exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Hilar contours are unchanged
 with fullness of the right hilum compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy as
 seen on the recent CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Diffuse
 bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and small nodular opacities
 throughout both lungs are minimally improved compared to the prior radiograph
 compatible with history of cystic fibrosis.  More focal opacity is noted in
 the left lower lobe, not substantially changed in the interval, compatible
 with an area of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Continued right hilar lymphadenopathy, likely reactive, with diffuse
 bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and small nodular opacities
 throughout both lungs compatible with history of cystic fibrosis, minimally
 improved from prior chest radiograph.
 2. More focal patchy opacity in the left lower lobe is relatively unchanged,
 compatible with an area of pneumonia as previously described on CT.
