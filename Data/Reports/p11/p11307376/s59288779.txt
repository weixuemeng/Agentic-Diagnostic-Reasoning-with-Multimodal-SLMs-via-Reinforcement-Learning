                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MDS, cryptococcal PNA, COP, with hypoxia now
 intubated.  // ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ at 13:23, the patient has been intubated, with
 endotracheal tube in standard position.  Apparent slight worsening of diffuse
 airspace opacities may reflect a accentuation by lower lung volumes on the
 current study.  Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated bilaterally.
