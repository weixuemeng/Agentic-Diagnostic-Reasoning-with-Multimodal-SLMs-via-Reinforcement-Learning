                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  New diagnosis of leukemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours show mild upper mediastinal widening, probably normal,
 although it is hard to exclude lymphadenopathy.  At the lung bases there is
 somewhat coarse reticulation suggestive of an underlying interstitial
 abnormality.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of interstitial abnormality at the lung bases.  Mild right
 paramediastinal stripe widening, but probably an artifact of technique. 
 Suspicion for interstital abnormality at the lung bases.  Evaluation with
 chest CT may be helpful to characterize findings in follow-up to assess for
 lymphadenopathy or interstitial disease.
