  There is a new right chest tube and small right apical pneumothorax.  The lung
  volumes are lower with increasing basilar opacities, which may represent
  atelectasis, edema, or combination of the two.  There are small bilateral
  pleural effusions and unchanged mild cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral ground glass opacities/infiltrates
 now s/p R VATS diagnostic wedge biopsy x2  // postop; eval for ptx, tube
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new right chest tube and small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 The lung volumes are lower with increasing basilar opacities, which likely
 represents CHF with pulmonary edema,  with some associated atelectasis.  Other
 etiologies for an interstitial infiltrates, such as atypical infections and
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis remain in the differential, but relatively rapid
 advancement compared with ___ is more suggestive of CHF.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions and unchanged mild cardiomegaly and prominence of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Multiple pulmonary nodules described on the
 ___ CT scan are difficult to appreciate radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right chest tube with small right apical pneumothorax.
 Diffuse interstitial infiltrates in both lungs, increased compared with ___.  Please see comment above.
