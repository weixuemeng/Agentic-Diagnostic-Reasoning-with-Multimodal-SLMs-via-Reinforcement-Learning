                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is accentuated due to the presence of low
 inspiratory lung volumes, appearing borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Assessment of the
 lung bases is limited by low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in both lower
 lobes may reflect atelectasis. No right pleural effusion is demonstrated, and
 no large left pleural effusion is seen, though a small left pleural effusion
 is not completely excluded. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases. Patchy opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. Consider repeat PA and
 lateral views when the patient can take a deeper inspiration for improved
 assessment of the lung bases.
