                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath, CHF, and falls. 
 Increased dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Exaggerated by the size of a large hiatus hernia, cardiac diameter has
 probably increased to level of at least mild cardiomegaly, accompanied by
 mediastinal vascular engorgement and small bilateral pleural effusions
 suggesting mild right heart failure.  There is no pulmonary edema or focal
 pulmonary abnormality to suggest pneumonia.  Thoracic aorta is generally
 tortuous and heavily calcified, but not clearly aneurysmal.  Transvenous right
 atrial lead is in standard placement, while a second lead, presumably intended
 for the right ventricle, ends at the inferior cavoatrial junction.
