                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A dual-lead pacer
 in unchanged position.  The proximal lead appears to terminate in the right
 atrium and the distal lead appears to terminate at the level of the junction
 of the IVC with the right atrium.  Please correlate clinically for positional
 adequacy.  There is a large retrocardiac density containing an air-fluid level
 compatible with a known hiatal hernia.  There is left basilar atelectasis and
 likely a tiny pleural effusion.  Kyphotic deformity of the chest somewhat
 limits evaluation.  Atherosclerotic calcifications along the thoracic aorta
 noted.  Tracheobronchial tree calcifications are also noted.  There is no
 definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Bony structures appear diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia, tiny left pleural effusion and left basilar
 atelectasis.  Stable position of dual-lead pacer though distal lead appears to
 terminate in the expected location of the IVC /right atrial jxn.  Please
 correlate for positional adequacy.
