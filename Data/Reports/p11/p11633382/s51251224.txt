                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged but similar.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally is re-
 demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Diffuse mild bronchiectasis is re- demonstrated with
 ill-defined nodular opacities, most pronounced in the lung bases, similar
 extent to the previous chest radiograph, and likely reflective of chronic
 airways infection.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bronchiectasis with ill-defined nodular opacities most pronounced in
