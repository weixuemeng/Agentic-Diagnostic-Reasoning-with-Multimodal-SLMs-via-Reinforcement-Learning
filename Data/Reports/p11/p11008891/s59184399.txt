 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of Whipple surgery.  Abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 minimally decreased, likely as a result of the known widespread fibrotic lung
 parenchymal process.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the
 left ventricle and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
