                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Patient with known idiopathic pulmonary
 fibrosis, on home oxygen.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and ___; also more
 recent chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  The lung
 volumes are again low.  There is widespread peripheral coarse reticulation of
 each lung, most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, most confluent in the mid
 to lower than upper lungs.  Best seen on the lateral view is a new patchy
 opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm on the lateral view with slight
 upward tenting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left posterior basilar opacity for which pneumonia or
 atelectasis could be considered, superimposed upon severe background pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Noting comparison with earlier radiographs from ___, interstitial
 disease has apparently been worsening.
