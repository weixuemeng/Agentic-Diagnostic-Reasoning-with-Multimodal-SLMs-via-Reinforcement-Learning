                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits evaluation.  There is likely bibasilar atelectasis causing
 the slight increased opacity at the lower lungs.  There is no clear sign of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 heart is top normal in size.  There is a mild dextroscoliosis of the T-spine. 
 The aorta appears unfolded.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Partially imaged dilated loops of small bowel are better assessed on the
 concurrently performed abdominal radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the chest.  Probable mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Please refer to concurrently performed abdominal radiograph for
 further details.
