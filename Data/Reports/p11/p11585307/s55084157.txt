                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube removal.  Patient is status post right lower lobe
 and right middle lobe lung resection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Small-to-moderate right hydropneumothorax is unchanged.  Right perihilar
 opacities consistent with a combination of postoperative changes, atelectasis
 and probably reexpansion edema are unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm as before.  Right subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.
