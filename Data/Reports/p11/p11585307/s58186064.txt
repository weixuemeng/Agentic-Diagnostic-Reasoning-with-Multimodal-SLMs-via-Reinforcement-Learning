                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right mid lobe-right inferior
 lobectomy performed on ___.  Check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta moderately widened
 and elongated as before, but no local contour abnormalities are seen. 
 Left-sided hemithorax remains normal.  On the right side, the right pleural
 effusion persists postoperatively and blunts the right-sided lateral sinus and
 obliterates the diaphragmatic contours.  In comparison with the next preceding
 study, the at that time existing hydropneumothorax has changed as the air
 component has been absorbed and the present pleural effusion remains and
 extends into the posterior pleural sinuses as identified on the lateral view. 
 Centrally located surgical clips identify the area of pneumectomy just below
 the right hilum.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormalities in the remaining right upper lobe area.  Pleural thickening
 exists, surrounding the apex, but no pneumothorax remains.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pleural effusion or possibly scar formations status post right
 middle lobe and lower lobectomy.  No remaining pneumothorax.  Left-sided
 hemithorax remains normal.
