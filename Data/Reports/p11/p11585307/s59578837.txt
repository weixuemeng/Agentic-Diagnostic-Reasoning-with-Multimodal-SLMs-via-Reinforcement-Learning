                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right lower lobe and right middle lobe lobectomy .
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Increasing radiolucency in the right lower lobe consistent with
 small-to-moderate pneumothorax is associated with multiple air-fluid levels. 
 There is increasing atelectasis in the inferior portion of the remaining right
 lung.  Small right effusion is probably unchanged.  There is deviation of the
 cardiomediastinum towards the right and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 as before.  Right chest tube remains in unchanged position.  The left lung is
 grossly clear.  Mild right subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
