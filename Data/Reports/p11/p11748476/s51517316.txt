                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with sarcoidosis, on methotrexate,
 with decreased PFT, evaluate for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  There is rather prominent bilateral hilar adenopathy with
 well-demarcated rounded prominences indicative of enlarged hilar nodes.  Most
 prominent rounded density is seen in the lower portion of the right hilum and
 two rather equals sized prominences are seen in the left hilum.  There is no
 evidence of any interstitial or alveolar pulmonary infiltrates in the
 periphery of the lungs.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free and no
 pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax
 grossly unremarkable.  Our records do not include a previous PA and lateral
 chest examination so that direct comparison cannot be performed.  The next
 previous available chest CT of ___ reviewed.  Bilateral hilar
 adenopathy evidence was present already at that time.  Measurements were
 performed on the CT examination identifying individual nodular sizes not
 exceeding 1.9 cm in diameter.  Although these measurements cannot be easily
 translated into the appearance on the chest examination, one has the
 impression that the adenopathy nodules today appear somewhat larger.  Similar
 as on the chest CT examination, there was no evidence of interstitial or
 peripheral pulmonary involvement.
