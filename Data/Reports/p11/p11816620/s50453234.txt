                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 805 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shock from AICD, recurrent, rule out
 infectious process or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 124.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 805 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with its leads intact and
 terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle
 respectively.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable
 post-operative contours.  Interval resolution of the pulmonary edema with
 persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology.  Linear
 opacity in the left mid lung is felt to most likely represent subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
