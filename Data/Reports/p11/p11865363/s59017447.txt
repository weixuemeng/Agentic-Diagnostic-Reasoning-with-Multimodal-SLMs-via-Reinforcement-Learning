                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate cardiomegaly,
 particularly there is enlargement of the left ventricle.  Additionally, there
 is a tortuous appearance of the aortic arch.  The lungs demonstrate no
 evidence of focal opacification, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are present within the thoracic spine.
 
 Minimal atelectasis of the right lung base adjacent to the right heart border.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process, however, degree of cardiomegaly
 and tortuosity of the aorta in a patient of this age is highly suggestive of
 hypertension.
