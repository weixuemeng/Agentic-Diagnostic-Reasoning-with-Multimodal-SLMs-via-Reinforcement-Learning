 wheezes eval for interval change      wheezes eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 21:27
 
 FINDINGS:

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this patient with known
 aortic dissection.  Interval appearance of a triangular opacity overlying the
 left heart as well as obscuration of the left costophrenic angle. These
 findings together likely reflect partial lower lobe collapse with an
 associated layering left effusion, less likely an infectious process. 
 Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No right
 effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
