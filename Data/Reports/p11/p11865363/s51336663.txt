                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with persistent cough,? pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A vague opacity projecting over the medial aspect of the right lower lobe
 appears to be stable since the prior radiograph. Given that the prior CT
 showed no evidence of parenchymal abnormality, this is likely due to
 vasculature. A tortuous aorta is noted, also stable finding. There is no
 evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute parenchymal abnormality. Re demonstrated is a tortuous
 aorta in this patient with a known type B dissection.
