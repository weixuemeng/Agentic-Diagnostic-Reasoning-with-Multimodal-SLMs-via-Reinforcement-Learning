                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post aortic valve replacement complicated
 by pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right pigtail pleural catheter
 has been slightly withdrawn, with the proximal-most side hole now outside the
 pleural cavity.  Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC. 
 Metallic aortic valve appears in similar position to prior.  Right atrial and
 right ventricular leads of a left chest wall generator are in stable position.
 Right pleural effusion has decreased, now small.  Small left pleural pleural
 effusion remains.  Right medial lung base and retrocardiac opacities have
 improved.  Small right apical pneumothorax persists.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right pleural catheter has been slightly withdrawn, with the proximal-most
 side hole now outside the pleural cavity.  Small right apical pneumothorax
 persists.
 
 2.  Decreased right pleural effusion and persistent left pleural effusion with
 improved retrocardiac and right medial lung base opacities.  
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on ___ at 14:45.
