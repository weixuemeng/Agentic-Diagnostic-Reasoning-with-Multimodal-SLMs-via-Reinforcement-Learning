                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post aortic valve replacement, now with
 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions have markedly increased.  Underlying
 consolidations most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Curvilinear density projecting above the meniscus of the right
 pleural effusion likely represents atelectasis, but cavitation cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate in
 the setting of overlying effusions.  There is no mediastinal widening.  Aortic
 valve replacement hardware is seen.  Pacing hardware appears similarly
 positioned on this view.  Sternal wires appear intact.  Mediastinal clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Markedly increased bilateral pleural effusions with underlying consolidations,
 most likely atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  
 
 Findings reported to ___ by ___ by telephone at
 12:49 p.m. on ___ at time of initial review of the study.
