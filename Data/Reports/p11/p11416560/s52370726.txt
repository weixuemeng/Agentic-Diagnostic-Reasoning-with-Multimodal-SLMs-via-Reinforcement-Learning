                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusions have
 minimally increased in the interim.  No definitive evidence of pneumothorax is
 present.  Right basal opacity is unchanged, most likely reflecting area of
 atelectasis.  Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.
