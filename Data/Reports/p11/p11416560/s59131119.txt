                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxemia, chest tube removal on the right.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided chest tube
 has been removed.  There is no convincing evidence of right pneumothorax.  The
 small right pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the right
 lung base is unchanged.  Also unchanged is the appearance of the left
 hemithorax, with a pre-existing effusion and areas of retrocardiac and left
 basal atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.  Constant
 position of the right internal jugular line as well as of the left pectoral
 pacemaker.  Status post CABG.
