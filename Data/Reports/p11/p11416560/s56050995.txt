                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of pleural effusions who
 presents for followup evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: Moderate, bilateral pleural effusions and right basal atelectasis
 and/or pneumonia, are improved since ___.  Biapical scarring is
 chronic.  The heart size is top normal and there is no edema or vascular
 abnormality. The aortic valve position is more inferior than expected,
 probably because of surgery to the aortic root.  There is no pneumothorax. The
 preoperative orientation of the right atrial lead, directed posteriorly, and
 probably abuting the interatrial septum, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and right basal atectasis/pneumonia,
 improving.
 2. Longstanding RA pacer lead probably abuts interatrial septum.
