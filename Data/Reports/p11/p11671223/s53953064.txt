                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, known history of rib fracture, tenderness
 on palpation on right
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is calcification
 of the aortic knob. Diffuse interstitial prominence is consistent with
 pulmonary vascular congestion, possibly superimposed on a chronic interstitial
 process.  Indistinct appearance of the posterior costophrenic angles is
 consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax. Left lower rib fracture appears minimally displaced.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small pleural effusions with pulmonary vascular congestion, possibly
 superimposed on a chronic interstitial process.
 
 2.  Minimally displaced left lower rib fracture.
