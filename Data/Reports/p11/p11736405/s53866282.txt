                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Evaluate for evidence of an
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior radiograph, the left-sided PICC line has been
 partially withdrawn, and the tip of the line has moved from its prior lower
 SVC position to the midline likely at the level of the left brachiocephalic
 vein. A nasojejunal tube is seen with the tip to the left of midline,
 following a contour compatible with placement in the fourth portion of the
 duodenum versus the proximal jejunum.  A line tracking across the left upper
 quadrant which may represent a drainage catheter.
 
 Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and clear noting right linear opacity
 suggesting atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Left-sided PICC has been partially withdrawn and now is positioned with
 the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Given the position, there is a risk
 of the line being spontaneously relocated to the internal jugular vein. 
 Withdrawal of the line by approximately 7 cm can be done to position tip in
 the left subclavian vein.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 10 a.m. via telephone immediately after discovery of the
 findings.
