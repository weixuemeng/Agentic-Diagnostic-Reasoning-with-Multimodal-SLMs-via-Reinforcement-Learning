                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question PICC line placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present.  The tip overlies the distal most SVC,
 retracted from its prior position.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Again seen
 is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  There is a small left effusion, which appears slightly
 more pronounced on today's examination.  No CHF.  Aside from minimal platelike
 atelectasis in the right mid zone and minimal atelectasis at the right lung
 base, the right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or effusion.
