                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior radiograph there is no substantial change in the mild vascular
 engorgement in the perihilar areas, in slight interstitial prominence in the
 lung bases that might be consistent with edema.  On the other hand there is
 slight interval increase in pleural effusion, on the right, mild to moderate
 on the current examination as opposite to small effusion on the prior
 radiograph.  Overall the amount of fluid has substantially increased since
 ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
