                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  There is
 suggestion of hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  Heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 slightly unfolded.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.  Old
 healed right-sided rib fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process identified.  Possible background COPD
 and mild cardiomegaly.
