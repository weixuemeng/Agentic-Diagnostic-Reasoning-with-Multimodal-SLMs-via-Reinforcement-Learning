                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Implant, for lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the leads, which extends to the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle.  Atelectatic changes are again seen above the markedly
 elevated right hemidiaphragmatic contour.  No evidence of pneumothorax or
 vascular congestion.
