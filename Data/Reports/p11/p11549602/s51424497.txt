                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Anasarca.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent prior study from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including borderline cardiomegaly and moderate
 unfolding of the descending thoracic aorta.  There are persistent moderate
 pleural effusions with basilar opacities that can probably be attributed to
 atelectasis, although these are not specific.  Exaggerated kyphosis is
 associated with lower thoracic wedge compression deformities associated with
 partial collapse of vertebral bodies associated with a recent episode of
 spinal infection.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest including moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Partial collapse of two lower thoracic vertebral bodies
 associated with a recent episode of diskitis-osteomyelitis.
