                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with prior pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  8:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pneumothorax, suggested by the deep sulcus sign on recent
 chest radiograph, is not convincingly shown on this AP upright projection. 
 Endotracheal tube remains at the level of the clavicular heads.  Right sided
 internal jugular catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis and small right effusion are unchanged.  Posterior spinal fusion
 rods are new.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No left pneumothorax is convincingly demonstrated.
