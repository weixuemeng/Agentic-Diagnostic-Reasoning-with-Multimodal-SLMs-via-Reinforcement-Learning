                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Vertebral osteomyelitis status post fusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable supine chest radiograph is obtained.  A left deep
 sulcus sign  is again seen.  No apical pneumothorax is visualized.  Right
 lower and middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  There are no fractures of the
 posterior left lateral spinal fusion hardware and intervertebral and vertebral
 disc spacers.  Endotracheal tube terminates in appropriate position.  A
 left-sided PICC line tip is difficult to visualize.  A right-sided internal
 jugular line tip is also not seen.  Left posterior rib fractures are partially
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Redemonstration of a left deep sulcus sign on this supine portable radiograph.
 Although no pneumothorax was clearly seen on the patient's upright film this
 finding remains suspicious for a small anterior pneumothorax.
