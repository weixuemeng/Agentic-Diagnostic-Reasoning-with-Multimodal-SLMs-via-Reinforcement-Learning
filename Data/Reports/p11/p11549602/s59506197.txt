                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of left PICC placement.  Position not identifiable on
 portable radiographs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___ at 3 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views again demonstrate bilateral atelectasis.  The
 distal tip of the PICC is still not visualized but is in at least the right
 atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Termination point of left PICC is still not identifiable. 
 Cross-sectional imaging would be the best option for definitively identifying
 the extent of the left PICC.  However, it terminates in at least the right
 atrium.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 4:14
 p.m. on ___.
