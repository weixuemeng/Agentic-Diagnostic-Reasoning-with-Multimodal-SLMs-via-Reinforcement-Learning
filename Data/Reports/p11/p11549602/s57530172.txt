                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with spinal osteomyelitis and epidural abscess as
 well as chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small residual loculated air collection may be present at the
 left base at the site of chest tube removal.  A more vertically oriented
 lucent line at the left base is more likely to represent a skinfold rather
 than a large pneumothorax.  Consolidation and small effusion at the right base
 are unchanged.  A right internal jugular catheter remains at the cavoatrial
 junction.  An endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway.  Nasogastric tube
 remains in the stomach.  Thoracic spinal fusion and spacer hardware is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No large left pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.  There
 may be a small loculated air collection at the chest tube site.
