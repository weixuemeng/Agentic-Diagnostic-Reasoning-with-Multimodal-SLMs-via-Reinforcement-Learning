                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p RUL/RML wedge  // check interval change post
 CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 05:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR performed earlier this morning, the right chest tube has
 been removed.  Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
 
 The known right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size since yesterday
 afternoon, but has remained stable since the most recent CXR performed this
 morning.  Within the right hemithorax, there are two new air-fuid levels,
 compatible with hydropneumothorax. There are likely tiny bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm suggest volume loss.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval removal of the right chest tube. Stable right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Two new air-fluid levels in the right lung, compatible with
 hydropneumothorax.
