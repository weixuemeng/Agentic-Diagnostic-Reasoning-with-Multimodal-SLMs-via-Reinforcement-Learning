  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Enlargement of the right hilus compared
  to the most recent prior exam.  This could reflect pulmonary arterial
  hypertension, but recommend chest CT for further assessment.Possible small
  right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly
 engorged.  The right hilus is enlarged from the prior exam.  The left hilus
 appears normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated.   There is no pneumothorax.

 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
