                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Within the right cardiophrenic angle, a 6.3
 cm x 6.7 cm diameter, well defined opacity is identified, and appears
 relatively lucent, suggesting possible fat content.  Mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperexpanded with attenuation of pulmonary
 vessels in the upper and mid lung regions suggestive of emphysema.  Minimal
 linear opacities in the right mid and both lower lung regions are present, but
 there are no focal areas of consolidation or pleural effusion.  Degenerative
 changes are present within the spine, and note is made of multiple healed
 left-sided rib fractures as well as degeenrative changes at the left shoulder.
 Additionally, a fracture of the third lateral left rib is of indeterminate
 age.  There is no visible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  In addition to multiple healed rib fractures throughout the left
 hemithorax, there is a fracture of the left third lateral rib, which is of
 indeterminate age.  Correlation with site of trauma and symptoms may be
 helpful in this regard.  If warranted clinically, a dedicated rib series could
 be obtained with metallic marker at the site of symptoms.
 
 2.  6.6 cm diameter, well defined right cardiophrenic angle mass is most
 likely a benign process such as a pericardial cyst, enlarged pericardial fat
 pad, or herniated fat from a Morgagni hernia.  However, in the absence of
 older chest radiographs for comparison, CT is suggested for more complete
 characterization of this finding.
 
 3.  Emphysema.
