                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diffuse back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No the pulmonary edema is
 seen.  No displaced fracture is seen although please note that this study is
 not optimal in assessing back pain.  If there is high clinical concern for
 back injury, should consider cross-sectional imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If high clinical concern for back injury,
 cross-sectional imaging is more sensitive.
