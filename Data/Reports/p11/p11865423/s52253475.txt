                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with headache general maliase  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are quite
 low.  Increased pulmonary opacities could reflect crowding of bronchovascular
 STIR in the setting of low lung volumes.  Difficult though to exclude a
 component of edema or pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited due to low lung volumes, difficult to exclude mild edema or pneumonia.
 Recommend repeat with more optimal inspiratory effort.
