 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:53 PM
  No pneumothorax.  Patient rotation causes the right internal jugular central
  venous catheter tip to project over the mid upper mediastinum; a subsequent
  chest CT confirms its intravenous location.  Overall, no significant change
  compared with the study from approximately 5 hr ago.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure and possible left pneumothorax seen on previous
 chest radiograph.  Evaluate for left pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs and CT chest, all from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an incompletely imaged
 left chest pacemaker with the single lead overlying the right ventricle.  An
 endotracheal tube in proper position.  The right jugular catheter projects
 over the right mediastinum, but is secondary to patient rotation and confirmed
 to be in the vein on subsequent CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  The remainder
 is unchanged, demonstrating a moderate right pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.  Previous reference to a left pneumothorax is explained
 by likely misinterpretation of skin folds, and is confirmed by subsequent CT
 chest. 
 
 2.  Otherwise unchanged chest radiograph, demonstrating a moderate right
 pleural effusion.
