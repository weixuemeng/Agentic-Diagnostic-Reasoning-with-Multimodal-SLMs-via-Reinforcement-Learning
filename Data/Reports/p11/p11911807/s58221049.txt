                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple effusions in the past status post L2 vertebrectomy with
 cage placement due to hardware failure.  Assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Left-sided chest tube is in situ.  No residual pneumothorax is seen.  There
 are patchy opacities present throughout both lungs, the most notable being a
 rounded opacity just above the chest tube, possibly reflecting hemorrhage from
 the chest tube passage.  Less convincing developing opacities in the right mid
 zone and also in the left upper lung zone just lateral to the pulmonary artery
 which appear almost glove-like or wedge-shaped are also noted.  There are no
 large effusions present.  Opacity in the left lung base is probably improved
 somewhat.  Orthopedic hardware alignment appears grossly unchanged.  There is
 no subdiaphragmatic free air.  Two rounded gallstones are projected in the
 right hypochondrium.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Developing bilateral opacities.  Significance of these is uncertain.They are
 presumotively infectious although the wedge shapes appearance raiss the
 possibility of an airway process
 
 Chest tube remains in good position.  Right-sided central line has been
 removed.  More noticeable right-sided rib fractures also incidentally noted.
