                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of tracheomalacia with tracheostomy for
 ___ years, respiratory distress, CHF.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Pulmonary edema is mild to moderate.  Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small on the right and moderate on the left
 associated with adjacent atelectasis.  Right infrahilar opacities could be due
 to asymmetric edema or pneumonia.  Followup is recommended.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Sternal wires are
 aligned.  There is a probably calcified lymph node in the left hilum.
