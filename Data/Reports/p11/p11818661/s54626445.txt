 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.

 No evidence of abnormality demonstrated to explain the patient's symptoms.  If
 persistent, assessment with chest CT should be considered to exclude the
