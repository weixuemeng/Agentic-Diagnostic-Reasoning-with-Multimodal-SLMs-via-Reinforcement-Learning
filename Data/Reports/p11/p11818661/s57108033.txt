 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the in capsulated loculated fluid
 collection in the right dorsal pleura, better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph, has slightly decreased in size.  The fluid
 collection continues to show an air-fluid level.  Despite interval increase
 there overall extent of the change is still large and tapping of the
 collection should be strongly considered.  No new pleural lesions.  The lung
 parenchyma appears normal.  No evidence of fibrosis.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
