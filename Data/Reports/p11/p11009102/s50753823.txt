  1. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. 
  Orogastric tube enters the proximal stomach and terminates beyond the field of
  view.
  2. Right infrahilar, right basilar and left retrocardiac opacities are most
  consistent with atelectasis.
  3. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  Probable moderate cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated  // ? effusion , ET tube placement,
 OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None provided.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. 
 Orogastric tube enters the proximal stomach and terminates beyond the field of
 view.  Lung volumes are low.  Right infrahilar, right basilar and left
 retrocardiac opacities most likely represent atelectasis, less likely
 infection.  There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  No large
 effusion on the right.  There is no central vascular congestion or overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult to assess in the
 setting of left pleural effusion, though likely moderately enlarged.  There is
 mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. 
 Orogastric tube enters the proximal stomach and terminates beyond the field of
 view.
 2. Right infrahilar, right basilar and left retrocardiac opacities are most
 consistent with atelectasis.
 3. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  Probable moderate cardiomegaly.
