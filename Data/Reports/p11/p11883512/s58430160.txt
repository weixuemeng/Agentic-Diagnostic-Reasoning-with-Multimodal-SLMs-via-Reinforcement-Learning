 HISTORY:  Right rib pain x.

 There is minimal left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture.  If clinical concern
 for rib fracture is high, consider dedicated rib series, which is more
 sensitive.
