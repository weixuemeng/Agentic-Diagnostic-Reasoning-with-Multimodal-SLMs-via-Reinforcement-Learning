                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, tender on exam, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam
 is suboptimal due to underpenetration from presumed patient body habitus. 
 There are low lung volumes.  The prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette may relate to low lung volumes and AP technique.  There may be a
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  The mediastinum is more prominent compared to the
 prior study.  No definite focal consolidation is seen although basilar one
 would be difficult to exclude.  There is likely basilar atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No definite evidence of free air is seen
 beneath the diaphragms.
