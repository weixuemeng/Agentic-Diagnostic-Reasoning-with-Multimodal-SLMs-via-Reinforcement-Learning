                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stridor  // Fluid overload?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, allowing for obliquity of the patient,
 there is little change. Cardiac silhouette is prominent and there is
 tortuosity of the aorta. Suggestion of opacification at the right base
 laterally probably represents merely overlying soft tissues. The right
 subclavian catheter tip extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
