 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  There is mild central vascular prominence without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. There is new obscuration of the left heart border, possibly
 atelectasis, but may reflect pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New obscuration of the left heart border, possibly atelectasis, but may
