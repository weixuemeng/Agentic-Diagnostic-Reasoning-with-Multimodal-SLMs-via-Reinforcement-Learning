 Evaluate for pneumonia given rising WBC count and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 nasogastric tube has been removed.
 
 There is minimally increased in heterogeneous opacities in the right lower
 lobe.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar atelectasis with increasing heterogeneous opacity of the
