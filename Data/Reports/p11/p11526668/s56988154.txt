                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with questionable widened mediastinum in prior
 examination limited by poor positioning.  Please perform PA and lateral chest
 radiograph for better assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed two hours prior to this exam as well
 as multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior exam, there is satisfactory positioning of the
 patient in this PA and lateral views.  There has been significant interval
 improvement of previously noted pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes continue to be
 low, with bibasilar streaky opacities, more pronounced in the left, which
 might represent atelectasis with or without superimposed pneumonia.  Although
 widening of the mediastinum is not significantly changed by plain film from
 ___, subsequent CT demonstrated new extensive paratracheal
 lymphadenopahty.  Blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle is stable since at
 least ___, suggesting scarring.  Tracheal deviation is not significantly
 changed from prior and is secondary to goiter, partially imaged in prior CT
 chest from ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A
 moderate hiatal hernia is not significantly changed in size from prior. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Significant interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Although widening of the mediastinum is not significantly changed by plain
 film from ___, subsequent CT demonstrated new extensive
 paratracheal lymphadenopahty. 
 
 3.  Chronic blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle, likely scarring.
 
 4.  Moderate hiatal hernia, unchanged.
