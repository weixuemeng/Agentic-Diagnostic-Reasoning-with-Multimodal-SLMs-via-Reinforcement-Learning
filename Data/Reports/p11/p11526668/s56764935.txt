                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and dyspnea.  Evaluate for
 widened mediastinum or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral diffuse opacities are compatible
 with pulmonary edema.  There may be superimposed bibasilar atelectasis. A
 moderate hiatal hernia is redemonstrated.  The mediastinum appears widened,
 but this is felt to be secondary to right lateral rotation of the patient's
 position rather than a true increased mediastinal widening.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is unchanged since at least ___, likely representing
 scarring.  Right lateral deviation of the trachea is secondary to goiter. 
 Pacemaker is seen projecting over the left hemithorax with the leads in
 expected position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings compatible with pulmonary edema.  
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is felt to be secondary to patient's
 rotation rather than a pathologic process.  Further assessment with PA and
 lateral radiographs with optimal positioning of the patient is recommended. If
 high clinical concern for acute aortic injury and findings persist, chest CT
 would also further evaluate.
