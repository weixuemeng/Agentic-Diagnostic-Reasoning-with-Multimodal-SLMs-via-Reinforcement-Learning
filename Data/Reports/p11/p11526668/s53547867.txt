                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, pneumonia and fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The heart is
 mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stable including a
 large hiatal hernia.  There is a new or increased small right-sided pleural
 effusion with lateral right-sided pleural thickening, suggestive of a degree
 of loculation of pleural fluid or new pleural thickening.  The pulmonary
 interstitium is again prominent.  There is new widespread opacification in the
 right lung, particularly in the right upper lobe.  Although the possibility of
 atypical pulmonary edema could be considered for this appearance, this degree
 of asymmetry would be more typical for an infectious process.  Correlation
 with clinical presentation and laboratory data is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: New opacities in the right lung, worrisome for pneumonia.
