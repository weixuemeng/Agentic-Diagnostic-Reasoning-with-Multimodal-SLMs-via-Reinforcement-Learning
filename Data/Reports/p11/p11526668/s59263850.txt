                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with diastolic congestive
 heart failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison with
 ___.
 
 Large hiatal hernia is redemonstrated.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable
 in appearance.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated but essentially clear.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Kyphosis accentuated by the presence of
 multiple mild compression fractures is noted.
 
 Upper zone redistribution of the vasculature is unchanged, most likely
 representing chronic status of the patient.
