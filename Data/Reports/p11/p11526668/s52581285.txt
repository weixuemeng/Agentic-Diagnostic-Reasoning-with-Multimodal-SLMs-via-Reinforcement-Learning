                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with small bilateral effusions and atelectatic changes at
 the bases.  No definite focal pneumonia or appreciable vascular congestion,
 though these are difficult to evaluate given the extensive scattered radiation
 related to the size of the patient.
 
 There is a substantial hiatal hernia.
