                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:02 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old.  Evaluate for effusion or consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 20:09.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in overall inspiration.  There is still persistent
 airspace consolidation with associated effusion in the right lung base which
 may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed infectious
 process should also be considered.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity
 favoring atelectasis with an associated small left effusion.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
