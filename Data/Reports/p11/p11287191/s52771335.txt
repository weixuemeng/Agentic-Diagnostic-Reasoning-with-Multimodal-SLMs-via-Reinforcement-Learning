                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DOE.  // Please evaluate for any
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Displacement
 of the mediastinum to the right with what appears to be a dense fibrotic
 streaks from the hilum to the right lateral chest wall raises the possibility
 of previous surgery. In addition, there are coarse interstitial markings which
 could reflect interstitial lung disease.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is seen.  No definite evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Comparison with previous images would be most helpful.  If further imaging is
 needed, a CT would be the next study.
