                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial
 improvement in extent of the pre-existing interstitial lung edema.  On today's
 image, with limited technique, there is no evidence of interstitial fluid
 overload.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Dorsal effusions, if present, are
 minimal.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  However, on the lateral radiograph,
 a zone of atelectatic lung is seen at the anterior aspects of the left lower
 lobe, adjacent to the left major fissure.  This focus might represent an area
 of scarring (it was present, in almost unchanged manner, on the previous
 examination from ___).
