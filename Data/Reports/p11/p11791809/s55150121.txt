                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with coughing  // eval for infiltrate, concern
 for aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 23:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly.  No definite CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at
 both lung bases, but no convincing focal infiltrate and no consolidation
 identified.  Previously seen increased markings at the right base have
 improved.  No gross effusion on either side.  The extreme right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left-greater-than-right bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate.
 2. Allowing for technical differences, previously seen right base infiltrate
 has improved.  Otherwise, I doubt significant change.
