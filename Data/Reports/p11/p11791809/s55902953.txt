                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  One week of productive cough and dyspnea in a patient with
 leukocytosis and history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are stable small bilateral pleural
 effusions as well as mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly worse than on
 ___.  There is a more dense heterogeneous opacity in the left
 lower lobe which partially obscures the left hemidiaphragmatic contour.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The thoracic aorta
 is tortuous.  Again noted are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions consistent
 with congestive heart failure.
 2.  More dense heterogeneous opacification of the left lower lobe may
 represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
