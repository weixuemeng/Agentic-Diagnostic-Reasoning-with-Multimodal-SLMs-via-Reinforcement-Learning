                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent ASD repair with hypoxemia and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple mediastinal clips
 again noted.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  There are
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  New ill-defined
 opacity are demonstrated within both upper lobes, as well as worsening opacity
 within the left mid lung field, findings concerning for a multifocal
 infectious process.  Additionally, there is mild pulmonary edema, which may be
 minimally worse compared to the prior study.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, are not substantially changed from the
 prior exam.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities are relatively similar
 from the prior exam, and could reflect areas of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New ill-defined areas of opacification in both upper lobes and left mid lung
 field, concerning for a multifocal infectious process.  Mild pulmonary edema
 appears slightly worse in the interval, with persistent small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are relatively unchanged, and
 likely reflect atelectasis.
