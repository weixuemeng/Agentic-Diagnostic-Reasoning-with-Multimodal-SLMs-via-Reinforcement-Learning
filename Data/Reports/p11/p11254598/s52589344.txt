 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, line placement, evaluation for pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:57 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination from yesterday, the extent
 of the left pleural effusion appears to have moderately decreased.  The
 effusion is now limited to the region of the costophrenic sinus. 
 Simultaneously, the extent of the retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis has
 decreased, as reflected by an overall increase in transparency of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.  No pneumothorax. 
 The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
