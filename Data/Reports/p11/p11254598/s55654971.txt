                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Meningitis and worsening respiratory status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued opacification at the left base
 most likely reflects a combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 pleural fluid.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  The right lung remains clear and there is no
 definite vascular congestion.
