                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Subtle linear
 densities within the left lower lung may represent atelectasis, though an
 early pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.
 The right lung is clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony
 structures appear intact.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Densities in the left lower lung most compatible with
 atelectasis, though an early pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
