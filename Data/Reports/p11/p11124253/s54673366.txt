                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is mild bibasilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There may be mild vascular
 congestion.
 
 Right infrahilar patchy opacity may relate to overlying vascular structures,
 although a small underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar patchy opacity may relate to overlying vascular
 structures, although small underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when
 patient is able.
