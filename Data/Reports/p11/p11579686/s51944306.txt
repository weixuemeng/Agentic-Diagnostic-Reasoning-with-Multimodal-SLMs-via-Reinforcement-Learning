                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea, vomiting, hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  While the right shoulder is not well evaluated, the right
 humeral head may be somewhat high riding, correlate with patient's symptoms;
 if so, this can be seen in rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Clear lungs.
