                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with difficulty speaking.  Question stroke. 
 Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are
 indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen bilaterally.  Some of this could
 be due to overlying soft tissues; however, there is suspected superimposed
 interstitial process such as edema.  There is no effusion.  Prominent
 extrapleural fat is seen particularly posteriorly and on the left at the apex.
 Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings suggest some component of
 interstitial edema and cardiomegaly.
