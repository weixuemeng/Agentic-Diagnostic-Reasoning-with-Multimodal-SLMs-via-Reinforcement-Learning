                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, status post MVC, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  A left subclavian central line is present, the tip
 overlies in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is some patchy increased retrocardiac opacity, with obscuration of
 portions of the left hemidiaphragm, more pronounced than on ___.Left
 hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.
 
 There are fractures of the left third, fourth, fifth and sixth ribs, possibly
 also of the left second rib and a comminuted fracture of the left scapula. 
 Opacity tracking along the upper left chest in this location represents some
 pleural fluid/hemorrhage, likely with some associated parenchymal changes. 
 These are also slightly more pronounced than on the film from ___ at 15:46
 p.m.  
 
 There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, with blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, unchanged.  Doubt CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures again seen.  Associated pleural and
 parenchymal changes are similar, but probably slightly worse.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion,
 also probably slightly worse.  Left hemidiaphragm is also elevated.
 
 3.  Minimal atelectasis/pleural fluid at right lung base are unchanged.
 
 4.  Comminuted left scapular fracture again noted.
