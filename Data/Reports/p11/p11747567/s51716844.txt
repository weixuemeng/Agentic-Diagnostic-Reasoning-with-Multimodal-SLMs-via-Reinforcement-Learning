                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the lung volumes are lower, accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no
 dense lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are also eccentuated, likely due to
 the lower lung volumes. The overall contour is not significantly changed from
 the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of bronchovascular structures in the setting of low
 lung volumes could be due to an atypical infection or small airway disease in
 the proper clinical setting.  No lobar consolidation.
