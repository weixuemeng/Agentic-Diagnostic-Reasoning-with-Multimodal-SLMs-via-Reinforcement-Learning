 The tip of the right subclavian line probably lies within the left atrium and
 could be pulled back 2 cm for better placement.  There is no failure.  The
 lung fields appear clear.  Some blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 noted.  This has been present on the previous films.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new infiltrates.
