                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There is evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema that is
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the left atrium.  In
 addition, the radiodensity of the lung parenchyma in the right upper lobe has
 increased.  This could reflect hypoventilation or developing pneumonia. 
 Continuous radiographic monitoring is required.
