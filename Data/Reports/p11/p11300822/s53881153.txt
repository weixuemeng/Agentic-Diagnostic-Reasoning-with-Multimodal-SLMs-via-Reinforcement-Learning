                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild
 tortuosity of the descending aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hyperinflation and flattened hemidiaphragms may be indicative
 of a chronic pulmonary process.  A 5 mm density is seen in the left lower
 lung, stable since the prior study and probably a calcified granuloma, is
 likely of no clinical significance.  Note is made of an old right clavicular
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
