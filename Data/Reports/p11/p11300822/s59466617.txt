 INDICATION:  History: ___M with episodes of confusion at night, possible
 altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, similar to the previous exam.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated. 
 Patchy right basilar opacity is improved compared to the previous study, but
 may reflect recurrent pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized without acute
 osseous abnormality detected.  Remote right mid clavicular fracture is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
