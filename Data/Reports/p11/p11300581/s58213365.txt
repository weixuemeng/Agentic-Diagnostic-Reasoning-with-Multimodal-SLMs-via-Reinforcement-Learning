 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:24 PM
  Bibasilar opacities and effusions, persistent but improved compared to
  ___. Increased opacification of the left lung field compared to the right
  could represent infection; however, it is difficult to separate this from the
  patient's underlying pulmonary abnormality. Discussed with ___ by
  phone at 7:22 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever.  Patient with pulmonary fibrosis and poor mental
 status.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Right lower lobe opacity has improved consistent with decreased pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  There has been mild interval increase in
 lung opacities in the left lung.  These are a combination of patient's known
 fibrosis and superimposed infection.  Right upper lobe opacities have improved
 consistent with resolving atelectasis.  Interstitial opacities in the right
 upper lobe are minimally increased consistent with increasing  mild
 interstitial edema.  Mediastinal widening is unchanged.  Patient has known
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Low lung volumes persist.  Cardiac size is top
 normal.  Right central catheter tip projects in the right atrium.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
