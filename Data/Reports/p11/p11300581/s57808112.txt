                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with pulmonary fibrosis, intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Extensive diffuse lung opacities have markedly worsened.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are difficult to evaluate, moderate on the right and
 small-to-moderate on the left.  Cardiac size is obscured by the lung
 abnormality.  ET tube is in the standard position.  Right supraclavicular
 catheter tip is in the right atrium as before.  NG tube tip is out of view
 below the diaphragm.
