                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Hodgkins, left IJ line removed today,
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film of ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath with its tip in the right atrium,
 unchanged.  Interval removal of the left internal jugular large-bore catheter.
 No pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial process, some of
 which is consistent with the known underlying pulmonary fibrosis.  Overall,
 however, there is likely a component of mild-to-moderate superimposed
 pulmonary edema.  Focal patchy opacities at both bases could also reflect an
 element of patchy atelectasis.  Prominent amount of gas within a distended
 stomach.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences and the patient rotation between studies.
