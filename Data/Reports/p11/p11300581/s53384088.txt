 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach with its tip.  The
 sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  The overdistention
 of the stomach has decreased.  The left and right venous access lines are
 unchanged.
 
 There is an increase in severity of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal
 opacities.  This increase is more obvious on the right than on the left. 
 Minimal increase in severity of the pre-existing right pleural effusions. 
 Mild increase in severity of the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis.
