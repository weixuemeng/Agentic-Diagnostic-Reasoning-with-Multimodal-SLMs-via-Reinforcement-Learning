                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications persist, consistent with the diagnosis of chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle persists, consistent
 with small effusion.  Given the substrate of interstitial disease, it is
 impossible to exclude supervening pneumonia.
 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the sidehole is probably above
 the esophagogastric junction.
