                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with shock.  Evaluate for worsening pulmonary
 status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___,013 in the ___.  CT chest
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right subclavian MediPort terminates in the right atrium.
 
 Allowing for differences in rotation, lungs are unchanged.  Again, diffuse
 reticular opacities are noted throughout both lungs, left greater than right,
 and are consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis, likely NSIP, as demonstrated
 on the prior chest CT.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There
 is no focal airspace consolidation.  Postbiopsy changes are seen in the right
 lower lung.  The cardiac size is top normal and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Little interval change.
