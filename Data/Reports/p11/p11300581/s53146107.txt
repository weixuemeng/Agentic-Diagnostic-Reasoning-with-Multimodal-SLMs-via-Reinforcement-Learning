                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as obstructive
 interstitial lung disease, now with productive cough.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An accessed double-lumen chest port is present with its tip in the
 superior right atrium.  The heart size is within normal limits, as are the
 mediastinal contours.  The lung volumes are low and patchy reticular opacities
 are present throughout.  Compared to the prior radiograph, the extent and
 distribution of the interstitial markings has decreased; however, there is
 still a small pleural effusion on the right, tracking up into the major
 fissure.  There is no pneumothorax.  Below the diaphragm, a prominent gastric
 bubble is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticular/interstitial lung markings reflective of an
 underlying interstitial lung disease with probable improvement of pulmonary
 edema; continued small right pleural effusion; distended stomach.
