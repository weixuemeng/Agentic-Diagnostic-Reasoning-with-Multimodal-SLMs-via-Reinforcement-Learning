 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia and pulmonary edema, question change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs remain quite low in volume.  Mild pulmonary edema in the right lung has
 improved, but not in the left.  Nodularity in the widespread pulmonary
 abnormality suggests concurrent infection.  Small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion has enlarged slightly over the past three days.  Heart size is
 normal.  Dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter
 ends in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
