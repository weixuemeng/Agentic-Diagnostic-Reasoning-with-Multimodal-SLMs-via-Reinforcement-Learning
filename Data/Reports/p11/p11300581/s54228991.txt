                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and shortness of breath.  Rule out
 pneumonia, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Again seen are
 diffuse coarse interstitial opacities affecting both lung fields compatible
 with interstitial lung disease, essentially unchanged from the most recent
 prior radiograph. Right subpleural opacity likely represents chronic pleural
 effusion.  A right Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Contrast is seen within
 the stomach.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive bilateral intersitial opacities, essentially unchanged from the
 prior study.
 2.  Small recurrent right pleural effusion or scarring.
