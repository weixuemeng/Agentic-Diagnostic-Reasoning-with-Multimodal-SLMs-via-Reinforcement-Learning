                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient hypoxic and tachycardic.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed nine hours earlier.
 
 Right perihilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing
 atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Low lung
 volumes are stable.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Diffuse lung
 opacities worse in the left lung are a combination of patient's known
 pulmonary fibrosis, mild edema and likely infection in the left perihilar
 region.  Right central catheter is in unchanged position.
