                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube
 withdrawn so that the tip now lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. 
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.  This appearance could
 reflect underlying interstitial fibrosis with supervening pulmonary edema,
 widespread infection, or ARDS.
 
 The other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
