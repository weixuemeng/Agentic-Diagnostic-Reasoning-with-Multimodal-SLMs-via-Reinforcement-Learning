                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with remote history of Hodgkin's
 lymphoma status post ABVD.  Evaluate for possible aspiration, pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding AP single view portable chest examination of ___. 
 Comparison of frontal views does not demonstrate any significant interval
 change.  Position of the previously described right supraclavicular induced
 double-lumen catheter is unchanged and terminates overlying the atrial
 structures.  Moderate degree of cardiomegaly appears unchanged.  Bilateral
 basal linear atelectases are noted and the previously described pleural
 effusion is still present, blunting the right-sided lateral pleural sinus and
 extending along the right lateral chest wall similar as before.  There is no
 evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates as can be identified on this
 portable chest examination.  There are two metallic structures overlying the
 right lung field on the frontal view; they are believed to be external.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.
