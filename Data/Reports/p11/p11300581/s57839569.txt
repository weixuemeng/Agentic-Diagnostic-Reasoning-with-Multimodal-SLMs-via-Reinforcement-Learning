                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with closed loop obstruction, status post
 exploratory laparotomy with fevers, increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 13:41 at 5:41.
 
 Portable chest film ___ at 11:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath remains unchanged in position.  There is
 increasing consolidation in both lungs where there is a diffuse airspace and
 interstitial process.  This could reflect worsening pulmonary edema or an
 infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is also gaseous
 distension of the stomach.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse airspace
 process.
