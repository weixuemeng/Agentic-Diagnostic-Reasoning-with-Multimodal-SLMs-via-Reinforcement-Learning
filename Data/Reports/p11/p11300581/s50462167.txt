                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypoxemia, evaluate for pulmonary
 edema, ? fluid overload, ? infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The findings are stable.  Thus moderate
 cardiomegaly is seen.  As before, bilateral pleural effusions blunt the
 lateral pleural sinuses and obscure major portions of the diaphragms.  In
 comparison with the previous study, the pleural effusion on the right side has
 increased as much as this reaches now the apical area.  Bilaterally existing
 pulmonary patchy infiltrates as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chest findings possibly some increased right-sided
 pleural effusion.  The portable chest examination cannot be expected to give
 more detailed differential diagnostic results.
