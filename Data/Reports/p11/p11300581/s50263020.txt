                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral coarse reticular interstitial opacities are again
 demonstrated with associated low lung volumes, in keeping with patient's known
 history of pulmonary fibrosis.  Interval improved aeration adjacent to right
 heart border could reflect improving acute process such as atelectasis or
 pneumonia. Post-biopsy changes are demonstrated in the right lower lung with
 adjacent small right pleural effusion, the latter also demonstrated on prior
 CT of ___.  Vascular catheter continues to terminate within the
 right atrium.  Linear mediastinal lucency to the left of the trachea is again
 demonstrated, and probably represents air within a distended proximal thoracic
 esophagus.  Pneumomediastinum is also possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting, and attention to this area on short-term followup radiograph may be
 helpful in this regard.
