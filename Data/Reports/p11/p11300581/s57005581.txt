                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 5:33
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ET tube placement, check fluid status
 of lungs with diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 6:02.
 
 Portable film dated ___ at 5:33 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right Port-A-Cath, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in
 position.  Although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not seen on the current
 study but does course below the diaphragm.
 2.  Interval improvement in bilateral airspace process, although there is a
 residual reticular nodule initial abnormality.  These findings are therefore
 consistent with resolving pulmonary edema, but the possibility of underlying
 interstitial disease should also be considered.  Interval decrease in size of
 bilateral effusions, right greater than left.  No large pneumothorax is seen
 although the positioning of the patient is not indicated and the sensitivity
 to detect pneumothorax would be diminished if acquired using supine technique.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient positioning.
