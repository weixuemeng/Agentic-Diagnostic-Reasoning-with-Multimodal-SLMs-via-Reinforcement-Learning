                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hodgkin's in remission, viremia, SSGS with nephrotic syndrome,
 volume overload.  Question ET tube placement, progression.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Compared with the earlier film, the ET tube appears to
 have been removed.  An NG tube is present, tip below the diaphragm. Left IJ
 central line tip overlies the right atrium.  A right-sided indwelling catheter
 overlies the right atrium as well.  
 
 Again seen are diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities,wit  small
 right and ? small left effusions. Compared with ___ at 6:35 a.m. they now
 appear somewhat more confluent at the right and left bases.  The appearance is
 nonspecific, but compatible with CHF and pulmonary edema.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, infectious or inflammatory infiltrate could account for this
 appearance.
