                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right lung biopsy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 After lung biopsy, there is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  Extensive
 parenchymal opacities appear to be even slightly progressed in the interim, in
 particular in the lung bases.  Central venous line catheter tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  The right chest tube is in place.  Subcutaneous air in the right
 chest wall is noted.
