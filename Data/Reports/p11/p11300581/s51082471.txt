                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pulmonary fibrosis with right-sided pleural effusion and
 distant history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, with acute mental status changes and
 tachypnea.  Please evaluate for reaccumulation of right pleural effusion or
 other acute interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The image quality is somewhat limited by motion artifact during image
 acquisition.
 
 Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter is again noted, with the tip in
 the region of the cavoatrial junction.  
 
 Diffuse alveolar opacities are seen bilaterally, which appears slightly worse
 than on the prior examination.  It is difficult to assess for significant
 pleural effusion, but layering effusions are likely present.  Cardiac
 silhouette is somewhat indistinct given technique, though probably unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight worsening of pulmonary edema compared to the prior radiograph from 3
 days previous.  Overall morphology is very similar to the torso CT examination
 performed earlier on the same day.
