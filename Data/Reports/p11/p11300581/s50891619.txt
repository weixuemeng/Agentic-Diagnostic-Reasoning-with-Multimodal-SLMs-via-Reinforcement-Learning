                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities have slightly
 worsened since the prior study, with increased confluence of airspace
 consolidation in the left perihilar region and slight increase in degree of
 opacification of the right upper lobe.  Observed findings could be related to
 clinically provided history of drug toxicity, but other processes such as
 pulmonary edema and infection may produce a similar radiographic appearance. 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged.  Moderate
 gastric distention is new, but note is made of interval placement of
 nasogastric tube on followup chest x-ray performed several hours later,
 dictated separately under clip ___.
