                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bleeding from recent chest tube site,
 inspiratory/expiratory films to look for an air leak.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiographs are obtained with the patient in
 upright position during both inspiration and expiration.  Right chest tube is
 stable.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes are
 significantly decreased but unchanged compared to the prior study.  Persistent
 bilateral areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Inspiratory and expiratory films show no significant difference in the
 intensity of the subcutaneous air which would be suggestive of a leak.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant changes compared to the prior study.
