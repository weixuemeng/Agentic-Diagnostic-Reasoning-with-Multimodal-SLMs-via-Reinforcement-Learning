                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper quadrant pain, known systemic CMV with shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  Small right pleural effusion appears
 relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam.  There are diffuse coarse
 interstitial markings within both lungs compatible with known chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  There is likely mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Right basilar opacification is
 unchanged, and could reflect a combination of atelectasis and chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior.  Diffuse coarse interstitial
 markings compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease.  Small right
 pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
