                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing O2 requirement and fever.  Evaluate fluid status and
 check for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back through ___,
 including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right port-a-cath ends in the high right atrium, as before.  An
 enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the upper
 stomach, although the side hole is in the region of the gastroesophageal
 junction, not significantly changed.  Lung volumes remain very low, slightly
 decreased compared to the prior study.  In addition to the known bilateral
 chronic interstitial abnormality, there are increasing reticular opacities
 throughout both lungs, particularly when compared to the prior radiograph from
 ___, concerning for mild interstitial pulmonary edema versus an
 atypical infectious process.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  A small right pleural effusion is likely present,
 unchanged.  There is no definite left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema versus atypical infectious process. 
 Background chronic interstitial abnormality.
 
 2.  Enteric catheter continues to end in the upper stomach with its sidehole
 at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  Advancement recommended.
 
 3.  Small right pleural effusion, not significantly changed.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:42 a.m. via
 telephone on the day of the study.
