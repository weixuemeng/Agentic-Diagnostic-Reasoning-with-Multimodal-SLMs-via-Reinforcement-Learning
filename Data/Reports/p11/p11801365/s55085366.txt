                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, terminating within the
 stomach, which appears markedly distended, although less severely distended
 than on the prior abdominal radiograph of earlier the same date.  Please see
 separately dictated CT abdomen and pelvis regarding findings concerning for
 obstruction.  Within the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are stable, and
 there has been worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and persistent small left
 pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is seen to better detail on
 recent CT abdomen.
