                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough x 3 weeks  // r/o acute infectious
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated significantly to the left, limiting evaluation.  There
 is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, suggesting small to moderate pleural effusion(s).Left base
 opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis as well
 as overlying external structure, however, underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.  There is mild increase of the interstitial markings bilaterally
 raising concern for mild interstitial edema.  The mediastinum is difficult to
 assess.  Cardiac silhouette is also difficult to assess but is likely
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Chronic deformity of the proximal right
 humerus is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to the patient being severely rotated as well as patient's
 arm overlying the lateral view.  Given this, left base opacity with blunting
 of the posterior costophrenic angles,  concerning for small to moderate
 pleural effusion(s) with atelectasis, underlying left base consolidation not
 excluded.
 
 Possible mild interstitial edema.
 
 Difficult to assess the heart and mediastinum.  The cardiac silhouette is
 likely top-normal to mildly enlarged.
