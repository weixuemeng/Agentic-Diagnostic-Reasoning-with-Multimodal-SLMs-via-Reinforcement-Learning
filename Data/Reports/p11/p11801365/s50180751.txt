                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dysarthria and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Opacity within the left lung base is likely a
 combination of atelectasis and a moderate effusion is slightly increased
 compared to recent prior.  The upper lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Right humeral head deformity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Progressive left lower lobe opacity, likely ongoing atelectasis and moderate
 effusion, though underlying pneumonia is possible.
