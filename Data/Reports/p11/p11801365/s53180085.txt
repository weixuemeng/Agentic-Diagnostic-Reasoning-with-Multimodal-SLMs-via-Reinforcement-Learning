                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // eval for pleural effusion/pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the left.  There are likely bilateral pleural effusions.
 Left base opacity is likely due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to actually assessed given rib patient rotation, but the cardiac
 silhouette is likely top-normal to mildly enlarged.
