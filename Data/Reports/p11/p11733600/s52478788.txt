 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___'s disease presenting with
 loculated pleural effusion s/p chest tube  // please eval fluid collection
 change, chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pigtail pleural catheter is in unchanged position.  Lung volume is lower
 than before, possibly due to less suboptimal inspiration during image
 acquisition.  There is persistent right lung opacity and moderate loculated
 pleural effusion.  Small left lung base opacity and pleural effusion is noted.
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette is similar to before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lung aeration is decreased than before, which may be due to
 differences in inspiration between the studies.  There is persistent right
 lung opacity and moderate pleural effusion as well as small left lung base
 opacity and small left pleural effusion.
