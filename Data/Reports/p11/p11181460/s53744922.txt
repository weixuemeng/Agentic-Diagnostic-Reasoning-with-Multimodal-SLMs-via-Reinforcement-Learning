                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lightheaded and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Lungs are hyperinflated, with streaky opacities in the right upper
 lobe as well as in both lung bases.  These may be reflective of atelectasis,
 and appear relatively similar when compared to the prior exam.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are multiple clips within the
 neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacities at the lung bases and right upper lobe, most
 likely reflective of atelectasis.
