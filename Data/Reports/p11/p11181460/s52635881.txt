                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with tachynpea  // shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is progression of the left basilar opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm.  Vague right basilar opacity is also seen but unchanged and
 potentially atelectasis.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are likely due to
 scarring as seen on prior CT.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is again noted. 
 Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aorta as well as lower
 thoracic kyphoplasty changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity which could be due to combination of prominent
 fat and atelectasis as seen on prior chest CT although superimposed infection
 or effusion would be possible.
