  There is no focal consolidation. Again noted are bibasilar streak opacities
  suggestive of chronic scarring. Biapical scarring with retraction is also
  noted. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
  is again noted consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension with no pulmonary
  edema. Aorta remains turtous and calcified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Surgical clips
 again noted in the neck.  Left CP angle is excluded.  Central pulmonary hilar
 engorgement is changed from prior, which could represent increased pulmonary
 arterial pressures.  Left lung base is poorly assessed with subtle increased
 opacity which could represent a developing pneumonia.  Right lung remains
 clear.  Heart and mediastinal contour is stable.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification in the aortic knob noted.  Bony structures intact.
