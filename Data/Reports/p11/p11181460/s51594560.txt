                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD and obstructive sleep
 apnea on CPAP, now with cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest shows surgical clips
 projecting over the lower neck alongside the trachea consistent with prior
 surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The
 thoracic aorta is large and markedly tortuous with heavy calcification of the
 aortic knob.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged without drooping of the hila.  The lungs are hyperinflated and
 lucent consistent with COPD.  Biapical pleural thickening is unchanged. 
 Chronic branching opacities are redemonstrated in the right suprahilar lung
 which has been stable over multiple prior studies dating back to ___, which
 likely represents bronchial wall thickening or bronchiectasis.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base are also chronic and likely represent
 atelectasis or scarring.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Findings consistent with COPD/emphysema.
 3.  Chronic right suprahilar bronchial wall thickening or bronchiectasis.
 4.  Chronic left basilar atelectasis or scarring.
