                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Tiny clips
 project over the neck, likely related to prior thyroid surgery.  Upper lobe
 lucency likely reflects underlying emphysema.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
 noted without definite signs of pneumonia or effusion.  There is no overt
 edema.  Heart size appears grossly stable.  Aorta is partially calcified and
 tortuous.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema with lower lung atelectasis.  No definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.
