  No significant change from the prior study of ___ at 00:38. 
  Persistent mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent
  opacity at the left base blunting the costophrenic sulcus may reflect a
  combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation
  such as in the setting of pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the
  proper clinical setting.
