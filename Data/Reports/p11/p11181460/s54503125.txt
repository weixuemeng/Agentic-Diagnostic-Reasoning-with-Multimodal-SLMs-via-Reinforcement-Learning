                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, shortness of breath  // eval for acute
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Tiny clips are noted projecting
 over the neck.  Streaky left basal opacity may reflect atelectasis though
 difficult to exclude an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  The
 right lung is clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable with a markedly unfolded and calcified thoracic
 aorta.  The imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity likely atelectasis though difficult to exclude a very early
 pneumonia.  Markedly unfolded thoracic aorta.
