  1. Left basilar opacity likely combination of small pleural effusion and
  atelectasis, pneumonia not excluded.
  2. Interstitial abnormalities with probable component of chronic underlying
  interstitial process with possible superimposed acute infection in the right
  upper lung.
  3. Mild cardiomegaly.
   Consider PA and lateral for further characterization.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with respiratory failure  eval for pneumonia, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.  Multiple surgical clips project
 over the neck.  The heart is mildly enlarged although obscured along its left
 border.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects a combination of small pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  There are scattered interstitial opacities and
 architectural distortion suggesting some component of underlying interstitial
 process.  Relative increased opacity at the right upper lung.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The aortic arch and descending thoracic
 aorta are heavily calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left basilar opacity likely combination of small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, pneumonia not excluded.
 2. Interstitial abnormalities with probable component of chronic underlying
 interstitial process with possible superimposed acute infection in the right
 upper lung.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider PA and lateral for further characterization.
