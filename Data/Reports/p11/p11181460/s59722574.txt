 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with myeloma and COPD with
 fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous, unchanged.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated but essentially clear.  Unchanged scarring in the right
 upper lobe is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Overall,
 no interval development of abnormalities that might suggest infectious process
 demonstrated.  Extensive calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are partially seen
 on the current examination, better assessed on the CT of the thoracic spine.
