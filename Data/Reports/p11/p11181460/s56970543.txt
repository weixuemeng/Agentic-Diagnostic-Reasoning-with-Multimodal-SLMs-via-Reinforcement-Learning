                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with some elevation of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD
 and some of the prominent interstitial markings could reflect chronic lung
 disease.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Surgical clips are again seen projecting over the lower neck, most likely
 related to a prior thyroid surgery.
