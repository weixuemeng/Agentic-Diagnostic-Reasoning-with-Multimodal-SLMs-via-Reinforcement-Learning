                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.  Chest CT ___
 chest CTA ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are
 compatible prior granulomatous disease.  Enlargement of the pulmonary artery
 is compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension, unchanged.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated with lucencies in the lung apices compatible with
 emphysema.  Again demonstrated within the right upper lung field are linear
 opacities compatible with scarring.  Streaky linear opacities at lung bases
 are relatively unchanged, and also likely reflect scarring.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia is present.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural
 scarring is again noted.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from the prior study.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.  Emphysema with chronic scarring in the lung bases and right
 upper lobe.  Evidence of prior granulomatous disease.
