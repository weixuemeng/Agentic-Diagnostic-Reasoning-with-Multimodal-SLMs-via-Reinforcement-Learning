                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain s/p fall  // fx? ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is severely limited secondary to motion artifact.
 
 Opacification of the left lower lung and blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may reflect a combination of pleural effusion, edema, and atelectasis;
 however are underlying superinfection cannot be excluded depending on the
 clinical scenario.  The remaining lungs, other than mild atelectasis in the
 right lung base is overall unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 overall unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.  Extensive
 calcifications of the thoracic aorta is similar the prior exam.  Bilateral
 apical pleural thickening is unchanged.  There is mild atelectasis in the
 right lung base as well.  No pneumothorax.  Surgical clips projecting over the
 midline neck are unchanged.
 
 Cortical irregularity of the lateral left ___ and perhaps 7th ribs, concerning
 for fracture in the setting of trauma.  Anterior compression fracture with
 wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears slightly worse from the prior
 exam, although difficult to be certain given the poor lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Left lower lung opacity is of difficult to evaluate, possibly oblique
 reflecting a combination of effusion, atelectasis, and/or superimposed
 pneumonia - a repeat lateral radiograph view could be performed to further
 evaluate.
 3.  Possible left sixth and seventh lateral rib fractures.  Correlate with
 clinical assessment.  Dedicated rib radiograph is recommended if there is
 concern of a rib fracture.
 4.  Midthoracic vertebral body compression fracture appears somewhat worse
 from the prior exam.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1.  Repeat lateral chest radiograph to further evaluate
 left lower lung opacity if clinically indicated.
 2.  Dedicated rib radiograph if clinical concern warrants documentation of rib
 fractures.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings, impression, and recommendations were discussed
 by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephoneon ___ at
 8:33 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
