                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ torso CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are grossly clear without consolidation noting that the left lung
 apex is obscured by patient's face.  Opacity at the left lung base laterally
 is compatible with prominent fat pad seen on prior CT.  Chronic underlying
 parenchymal changes are noted, particularly noted at the right upper lung. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries are
 again noted as well as dense atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic
 aorta which is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
