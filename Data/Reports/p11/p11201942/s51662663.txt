 HISTORY:  Weakness and dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
