                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance is re- demonstrated.  The
 aorta remains tortuous.  Right hilar lymphadenopathy is unchanged.  Mild
 increased interstitial opacities may suggest mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement or shronic interstitial abnormality, similar to the previous study
 suggestive of mild interstitial edema.  Lungs remain hyperinflated compatible
 with underlying emphysema.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes
 are seen in the thoracic spine with anterior wedging of a vertebral body at
 the thoracolumbar junction, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild increased interstitial opacities appear chronic and may reflect mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema or chronic interstitial abnormality, unchanged.
