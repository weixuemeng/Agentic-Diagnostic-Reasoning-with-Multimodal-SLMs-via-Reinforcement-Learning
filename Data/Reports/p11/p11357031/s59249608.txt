                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally is similar compared to the
 prior study may indicate mild interstitial edema which may be chronic.  Patchy
 right basilar opacity is stable to possibly slightly increased compared to the
 prior study, may relate to atelectasis and edema; however, early/mild
 infectious process is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting
 interstitial edema, chronic.  Slight increase in patchy opacity at the right
 lung base is nonspecific and could relate to atelectasis; however, infectious
 process not excluded.
