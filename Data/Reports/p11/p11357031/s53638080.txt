                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness and malaise  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes limits assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy and linear
 bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  .   There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.  No definite pneumonia. 
 Repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level would be helpful for more
 complete assessment of the lung bases when the patient's condition permits.
