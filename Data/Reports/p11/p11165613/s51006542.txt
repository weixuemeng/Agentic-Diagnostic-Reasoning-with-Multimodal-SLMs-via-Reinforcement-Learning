                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hematemesis, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly, with a tortuous unfolded aorta.  There is mild upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora, similar to ___ at 17:13 p.m., but
 doubt overt CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at left- greater-than-right lung bases.
 There is also some patchy retrocardiac opacity, which may be slightly worse. 
 No effusion.  Again noted are bilateral proximal humeral fractures, which do
 not appear acute.  Diffuse osteopenia noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight increase in the degree of patchy opacity at the left base, nonspecific
 in appearance.  Doubt overt CHF.
