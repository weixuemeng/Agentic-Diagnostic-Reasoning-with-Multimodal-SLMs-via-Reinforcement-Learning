                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-upright portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural effusion on the right but
 there is a suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the left with increased,
 confluent but focal opacity obscuring the left heart border, probably within
 the lingula.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central venous catheter terminating in the superior vena cava; no evidence of
 pneumothorax. Increased opacification in the left mid to lower lung,
 suggesting developing opacity, possibly pneumonia, in the lingula with small
 suspected pleural effusion.
