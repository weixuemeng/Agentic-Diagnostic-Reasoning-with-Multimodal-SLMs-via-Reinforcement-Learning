                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  One to two months of persistent cough.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac size is normal.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 vasculature.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Increased opacities near the apices of both lungs are due to
 costochondral cartilage changes rather than parenchymal opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
