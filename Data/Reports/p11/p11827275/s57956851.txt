                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations of technique,
 however, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear probably
 unchanged.  There is bilateral perihilar fullness, greater on the left than
 right, however, with a mild interstitial process, most suggestive of pulmonary
 congestion.  Small pleural effusions are suspected in addition to thickening
 along the minor fissure.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings most suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
