                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M prior lymphoma, successfully treated ___, here w/ hemolytic
 anemia and SOB  // infiltrate? mediastinal LAD?
 
 COMPARISON:  NONE
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 -Cardiomediastinal contours are suboptimally evaluated due to portable
 technique and low lung volumes. Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Lungs
 and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there is no bulky lymphadenopathy evident, it is difficult to exclude
 potentially clinically significant lymph node enlargement on this limited
 exam. Considering history of lymphoma, standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs or a dedicated chest CT would be suggested if warranted clinically
