                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, known pulmonary emboli and metastatic breast
 cancer to the liver.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Heart size is borderline
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities in the left lung base likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 likely indicative of a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or right-sided
 pleural effusion is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.  Small left pleural effusion.
