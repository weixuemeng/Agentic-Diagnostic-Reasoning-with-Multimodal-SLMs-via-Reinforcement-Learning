                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with GI bleed with cuff leak, requiring urgent ET
 tube replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 4:47 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 mild cardiomegaly.  Again seen is stable dense opacity in the retrocardiac
 left lung base.  Also seen are streaky opacities and mild volume loss in the
 right lung base indicative of atelectasis.  There is mild improvement in the
 pulmonary edema.  A small left pleural effusion is likely present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube is now optimally positioned with the tip 3.5 cm
 above the carina.
