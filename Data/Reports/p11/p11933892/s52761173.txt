                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with GI bleed status post intubation to assess
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
 
 Endotracheal tube ends approximately 8.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube courses through the stomach and out of view.  
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits for technique.  The lung volumes are low, with dense opacity in
 the retrocardiac left lower lobe, likely atelectasis. There are diffuse
 interstial and opacities in both lungs with small areas of confluence
 bilaterally, likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates 8.5 cm above the carina.  Recommended
 further advancement for optimal positioning.
 2.  NGT beneath diaphragm, off film.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
 4.  Bilateral opacities, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema.
 5.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
