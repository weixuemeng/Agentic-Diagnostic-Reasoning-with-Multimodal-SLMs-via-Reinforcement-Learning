                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with severe right-sided pneumonia and worsening
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained.  Exam is
 limited by low lung volumes and portable technique.  Increased hilar
 indistinctness and increased azygous distension suggest worsening pulmonary
 edema.  Atelectasis at the left base is unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacity is
 more conspicuous; the left hemidiaphragm is completely obscured.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in mild to moderate vascular congestion. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis versus consolidation.
