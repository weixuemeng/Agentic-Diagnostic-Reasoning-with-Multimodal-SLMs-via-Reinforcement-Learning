                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Ovarian cancer, right pleural effusion, status post
 thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right chest tube.  The extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion has
 massively decreased.  The effusion is now restricted to the costophrenic
 sinus.  Areas of basal atelectasis are seen.  Parts of the opacities could be
 caused by re-expansion pulmonary edema.  The lung is otherwise normal.  There
 is no post-procedural pneumothorax.  Normal appearance of the left lung, a
 pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is resolved in the interval.
