                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malignant right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ at 9:42 a.m..
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 right pleural effusion is still large, but decreased compared to the prior
 study with improvement in leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Adjacent
 opacity is likely due to atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  A right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.  Decreased right pleural effusion, still large.
