                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right Pleurx catheter placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with most recent chest radiograph from
 same day at 11:09.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right pleurx catheter and right port-a-cath appear in place. There has been
 an interval decrease in right sided pleural effusion with improved aeration of
 the right lung base.  There is a slight apical lucency which may be
 representative of a tiny right apical pneumothorax. There is no shift of the
 midline structures. The lungs are without a focal consolidation.  Cardiac
 silhouette appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion with improved aeration of
 the right lung base.
 
 2. Tiny right apical lucency may be representative of a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax. Continued followup is recommended. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
