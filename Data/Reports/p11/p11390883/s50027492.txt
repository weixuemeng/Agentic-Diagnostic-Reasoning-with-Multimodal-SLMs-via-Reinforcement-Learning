                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NASH/GI Bleed and now ARDS  // interval
 change, ET tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube has apparently
 been advanced, with tip now terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.
 This could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for decrease in extent of widespread bilateral alveolar opacities.
