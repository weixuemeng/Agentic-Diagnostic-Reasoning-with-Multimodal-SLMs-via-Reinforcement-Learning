                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, intubated for acute hypoxic
 resp failure (?ARDS vs pna)  // ?pulm edema vs. consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated which limits assessment.  The endotracheal
 tube is positioned with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina, this is
 improved compared to the prior study.  Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities
 are slightly improved when compared to the prior study.  Again this may
 reflect pulmonary edema versus infection.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  A right internal
 jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 
 Slight interval improvement in the bilateral airspace opacities.
