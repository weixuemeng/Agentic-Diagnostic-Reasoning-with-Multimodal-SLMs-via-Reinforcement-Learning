                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hematemesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.  Lung volumes are low, likely
 exaggerating pulmonary vasculature which is mildly prominent.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  There is possibly a small left
 pleural effusion.  An esophageal catheter is incompletely evaluated due to
 exposure.  Sternal wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with cardiomegaly and possible small left
 pleural effusion.  Incomplete evaluation of esophageal catheter, which
 possibly terminates in the mid esophagus.  Per discussion with Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ by telephone at 21:02 on ___, this tube may
 possibly be in place intentionally within the mid esophagus.  If gastric
 placement is desired, advancing the tube is recommended if not contraindicated
 for this patient.
