                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with 14 ___ pigtail chest tube placed with 3
 liters pleural fluid drained.  Confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, 13:59; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to two hours prior there is interval placement of a right
 pigtail catheter with tip projecting over the right diaphragmatic surface and
 is in appropriate position. Significant decrease in right pleural effusion
 with persistent veil-like opacity in the right lung suggesting small to
 moderate pleural effusion.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe
 superior to the minor fissure likely represents layering residual pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No mediastinal shift. The left lung is unchanged
 with small area of linear atelectasis.  Partially visualized heart size and
 mediastinal contours are normal. Hilar contours are normal. Unchanged right
 Port-A-Cath projecting over the right chest wall with tip in the low SVC. Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of right pigtail catheter with tip in appropriate
 position projecting over the right diaphragmatic surface. Significant decrease
 in right pleural effusion with persistence of small to moderate effusion. No
 pneumothorax. 
 2.  Unchanged mild left lower lung atelectasis.
