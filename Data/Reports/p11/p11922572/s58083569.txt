                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracentesis, follow up effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and Chest CT, ___.
 
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There has been no significant change in the
 loculated moderate right pleural effusion after thoracentesis.  Persistent
 pleural thickening with extension into the mediastinum is similar to the prior
 CT and are ascribed to changes of pleurodesis and/or tumor.  A more focal
 opacity in the right lower lobe is unchanged and consistent with loculated
 pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A right MediPort terminates
 in the low superior vena cava.
