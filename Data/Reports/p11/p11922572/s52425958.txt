                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 opacification involving right hemithorax consistent with the diagnosis of a
 large multilobulated pleural effusion with known associated pleural
 thickening.  Substantial volume loss in the right lung is again noted.  It is
 difficult to assess whether there is associated consolidation, and this
 determination would have to be done on clinical grounds.
 
 Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy persist. 
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
