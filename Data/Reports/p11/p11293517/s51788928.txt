                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup evaluation of CHF exacerbation and possible right lower
 lobe consolidation seen on chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 resolution of pulmonary edema as well as the possible right lower lobe
 consolidation.  Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  The upper mediastinum is now
 less widened, consistent with resolution of central vascular engorgement. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  The atrial, biventricular ICD are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and right lower lobe
 consolidation.
