                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recurrent pneumonias, presenting with malaise, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are slightly less as compared to the prior study.  Again, there is enlargement
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette which is slightly more prominent as
 compared to the prior study, which may be due to AP techique and lower lung
 volumes.  Left-sided pacer device is stable.  Right-sided abandoned leads are
 also unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 pneumothorax.
