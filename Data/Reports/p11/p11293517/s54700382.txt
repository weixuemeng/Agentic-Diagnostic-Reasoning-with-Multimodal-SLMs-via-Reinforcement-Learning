                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GNR sepsis, now worsening shortness of breath, question pneumonia,
 aspiration, or volume overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 9:38 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is some patchy opacity at the left lung base and cardiophrenic regions.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  Again seen is
 cardiomegaly, with stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left-sided
 pacemaker-type device and additional abandoned leads are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
