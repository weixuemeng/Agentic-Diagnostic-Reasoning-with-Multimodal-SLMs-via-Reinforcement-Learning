                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Left
 chest wall pacer pack is again seen with leads extending into the right heart.
 Abandoned pacing leads are also noted in the right chest wall extending into
 the right heart.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Lung volumes are
 low, with equivocal ground-glass opacity on the frontal view, which appears
 less conspicuous on the lateral view most likely attributable to
 underpenetrated technique.  No gross evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.  No large effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study demonstrating moderate cardiomegaly and no overt
 edema or pneumonia.
