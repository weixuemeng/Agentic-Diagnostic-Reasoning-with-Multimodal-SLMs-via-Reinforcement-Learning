 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Emphysema, bronchiectasis, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of massive overinflation, combined to areas of bronchiectasis, notably at the
 posterior lung bases, and better appreciated on the lateral than on the
 frontal radiograph.  No pleural effusions are seen.  No evidence of focal
 parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
