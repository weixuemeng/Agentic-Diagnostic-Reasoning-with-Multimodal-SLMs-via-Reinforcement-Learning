                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with bronchiectasis, COPD, worsening
 pulmonary function tests and sputum production.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  Mild widening and elongation of the thoracic aorta with
 calcium deposits in the wall appears also unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Similar as on the preceding examination, there
 are low positioned and flattened diaphragms coinciding with a marked
 irregularity in the vascular distribution in the periphery of both lungs with
 areas of increased translucency mostly on the lung bases.  These findings are
 grossly unchanged indicative of rather advanced COPD with emphysema.  New
 acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings since ___.  Findings indicative
 of advanced COPD but no evidence of new acute infiltrate.
