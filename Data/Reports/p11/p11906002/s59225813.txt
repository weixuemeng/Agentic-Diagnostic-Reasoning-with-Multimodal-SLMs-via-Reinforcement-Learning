 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe ILD presenting with increased sputum
 production and dyspnea on exertion  // ?pulmonary edema v. edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  No definite pulmonary edema is visualized.  Diffuse coarse
 interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally, most pronounced in the left lung
 base, in a primarily peripheral and basilar distribution compatible with a
 fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease without definite evidence
 for superimposed pulmonary edema.
