                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with sickle cell anemia and chronic
 non-productive cough, evaluate for interval change from last chest x-ray
 performed in ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___.  Heart size is still mildly enlarged but less so
 than on the previous examination.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 seen, nor are there any intracardiac calcifications identified.  The thoracic
 aorta is unremarkable in size and no local contour abnormalities are present. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax in the apical
 area on the frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax remain unchanged
 and are grossly unremarkable.
 
 As before, evidence of surgical clips in right upper abdomen consistent with
 previous cholecystectomy.  Lateral ornamental metallic artifacts in both
 breast areas, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild regression of previously existing cardiomegaly in patient
 with history of sickle cell anemia.  No new pulmonary vascular or parenchymal
 abnormalities, pleural spaces remain free and no evidence of pneumothorax.
