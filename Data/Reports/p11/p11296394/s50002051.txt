                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Early pneumonia diagnosed last week, now with persistent cough
 and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  CTA chest
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  Opacities projecting over the
 spine on the lateral radiograph have improved; however, there is mild
 persistent opacity.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 The included osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved mild residual opacity at the left base may reflect
 resolving pneumonia.
