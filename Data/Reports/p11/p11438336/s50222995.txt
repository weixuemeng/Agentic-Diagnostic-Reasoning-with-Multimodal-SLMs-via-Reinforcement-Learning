                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever and altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 Increased perihilar opacities and Kerley B lines are compatible with pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior studies.  The
 right costophrenic sulcus is not well seen, possibly due to a small right
 pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Aortic knob calcifications are again seen.
 
 Hardware in the left humeral head, incompletely evaluated on this study.  The
 left humeral head is not seated in the glenohumeral joint and appears more
 displaced than on ___ and definitely more displaced than on ___. 
 Some of the difference may be due to differences in patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with possible small right pleural effusion.
 Consider repeat radiograph after diuresis to evaluate for underlying
 pneumonia.
 2.  Increased left shoulder dislocation/displacement since ___ and
 ___, which may in part be due to technique.  Dedicated shoulder
 radiographs could be obtained if clinically indicated.
 
 Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 8:10pm ___.
