                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of
 35% with evidence of fluid overload, evaluation of the patient after
 hydration.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient has now worsening pulmonary edema, moderate to severe.  More
 pronounced right lower lobe opacities are currently seen and although might be
 part of pulmonary edema, might also reflect infectious process and should be
 followed separately.  The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid low SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
