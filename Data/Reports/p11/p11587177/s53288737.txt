                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, cough, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight
 blunting of the costophrenic angles is most likely due to overlying soft
 tissue.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette remaining mildly enlarged. 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  While there may be mild
 central pulmonary vascular engorgement, there is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 no focal consolidation seen.  Persistent mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
