                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal opacities which are most dense in the right lower and
 middle lobes suggestive of pneumonia.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion
 seen to track within the minor fissure as well.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, more so on the right,
 particularly within the middle and lower lobes than on the left with a
 moderate right-sided effusion.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document
 resolution.
