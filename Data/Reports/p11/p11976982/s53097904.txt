                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent ED visit for pneumonia with continued
 symptoms.  Three days of abdominal pain.  Elevated LFTs.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Again seen are diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, somewhat more confluent on the right than on the left.  There is
 superimposed right-sided pleural effusion with presumed fluid tracking in the
 minor fissure, similar to prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities and right effusion
 similar to prior.  As patient's presentation and symptoms may not be as severe
 as radiographic picture, CT scan suggested to further evaluate and can be done
 at time of abdominal CT already scheduled.
