                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis and worsening shortness of breath.  History of lung
 cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Multiple chest radiographs dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is near-complete opacification of the right lung due
 to a combination of effusion, consolidation, and tumor burden.  In the left
 lung, the patchy rounded opacities have increased since the prior radiograph
 performed five hours prior.  There is likely a trace left pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The
 osseous structures demonstrate increased density, consistent with diffuse
 metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing patchy consolidation of the left lung.  Given the short time
 interval, this change is likely either due to worsening infection, edema, or
 hemorrhage, rather than tumor spread superimposed on the known metastases.  
 2.  Stable near-complete opacification of the right lung from effusion,
 consolidation, and tumor burder.
 3.  Diffuse widespread osseous metastases.
