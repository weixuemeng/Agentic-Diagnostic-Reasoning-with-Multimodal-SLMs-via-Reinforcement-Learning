 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:10 PM
  Compared to ___:  Loculated right pleural effusion is probably larger. 
  There is further opacification of the right upper lobe, which may represent
  disseminated tumor spread, pneumonia is not excluded.  Rightward tracheal
  deviation suggests partial lung collapse, likely obstructive from tumor. 
  Diffuse nodular opacities in the left lung again likely tumor growth, but
  acute infection is possible in the right clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is increased opacification over the right lung, likely due to increase
 in loculated pleural effusion, underlying atelectasis, with concern for
 worsening of metastatic disease, underlying consolidation or infection not
 excluded.  Increased opacification of the right upper lobe may represent
 increased tumor spread although infection is not excluded.  The patient is
 rotated to the right, however, library deviation of the trachea suggest
 partial lung collapse, likely obstruction from tumor.  Increasing nodular
 opacities diffusely throughout the lower left lung is highly concerning for
 progression of metastatic disease.  A small left pleural effusion is difficult
 to exclude.  Diffuse osseous metastases better evaluated on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Significant interval increase and opacification of the right lung, probably
 due to increase in underlying loculated right pleural effusion, but also
 concerning for progression of metastatic disease.  Underlying consolidation
 due to infection is difficult to exclude.
