 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:   pleural fluid aspiration, assess for pneumothorax.
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is a small right apical pneumothorax.  Small loculated right pleural
 effusion is grossly unchanged.  Cardiac size is top normal.  Widened
 mediastinum is due to known lymphadenopathy.  Multiple bilateral lung nodules
 are better seen in prior CT from ___.  Larger opacity in the periphery
 of the left upper lobe is less conspicuous than before.
