                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and wheezing, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is again seen with dual leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle, as before.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits with mild calcification of the aortic knob. 
 Multiple surgical clips projecting in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
 may be related to prior cholecystectomy.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
