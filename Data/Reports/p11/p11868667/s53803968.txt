                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of CHF, presenting with chest pain and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the expected positions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  Subtle retrocardiac left base opacity most likely relates to
 atelectasis rather than consolidation.
