 eventration when compared to the prior study, although diaphragmatic hernia
 could also have this appearance.  There is likely a small hiatal hernia. 
 Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  Right paratracheal nodular opacity likely represents a
 dilated vein related to a fluid replete state.  No pleural effusions,
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.
