                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post appendectomy with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Oral
 contrast material is seen within the bowel.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
