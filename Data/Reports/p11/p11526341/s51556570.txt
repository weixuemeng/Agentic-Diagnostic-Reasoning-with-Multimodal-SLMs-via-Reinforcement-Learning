                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is malpositioned, and terminates within the proximal
 esophagus, with side port at the level of the thoracic inlet.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Patchy ill-defined opacity is noted within the right lung base
 which could reflect an area of aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema is present.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Standard position of the  endotracheal tube.
 
 2. Malpositioned enteric tube terminating in the proximal esophagus.
 
 3. Patchy ill-defined opacity in the right lung base could reflect an area of
 aspiration or pneumonia.
