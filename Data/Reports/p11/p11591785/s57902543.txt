                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is new mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared
 to the prior examination with mild distention of the colon at the splenic
 flexure projecting immediately beneath the left hemidiaphragm, although not
 abnormal.  Patchy opacity along the left hemidiaphragm appears compatible most
 likely with atelectasis that might be expected with elevation of the
 diaphragm.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  New
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with patchy opacity at the left lung base,
 probably due to atelectasis.
