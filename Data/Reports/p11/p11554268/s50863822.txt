                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and weight loss.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. 
 No acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle most likely reflects pleural thickening.
