                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman withgangrenous right toes  // dyspnea- eval
 pulm edema      dyspnea- eval pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette in a patient with dual-channel pacer leads extending to
 the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.  There is increased
 indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels.  This is consistent with
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though some of the difference may be
 due to the the AP supine rather than PA erect views.
