                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rash, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient
 is rotated to the right, which somewhat limits the evaluation.  A dual-lead
 pacer is unchanged in position.  There is blunting of the left CP angle which
 could be reflective of a tiny pleural effusion.  There is no focal
 consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  No definite signs of CHF.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable allowing for patient
 rotation.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny left pleural effusion.  Otherwise unremarkable.
