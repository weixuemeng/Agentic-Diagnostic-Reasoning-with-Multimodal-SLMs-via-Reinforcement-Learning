                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low resulting in vascular
 crowding.  Within this limitation, cardiac size is top normal.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  Prominence of the hilar
 vasculature is consistent with mild pulmonary congestion.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Fine osseous detail is obscured by overlying
 soft tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions
 and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
