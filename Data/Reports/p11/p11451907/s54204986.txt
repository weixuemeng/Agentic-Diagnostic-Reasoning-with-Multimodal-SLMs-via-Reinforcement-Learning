                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with productive cough and shortness of breath.
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate top normal heart
 size and mild tortuosity to the descending aorta.  The lungs are clear. 
 Minimal perihilar vascular congestion without frank edema is similar as
 compared to 10 days prior.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.  No
 confluent consolidation is apparent to suggest infection.  Lower thoracic
 spondylosis is present.
 
 Note is made of radiodensities in the expected location of the aortic valve,
 similar to ___, raising question of aortic valvular calcifications,
 which would be difficult to differentiate from pulmonary nodules on
 radiograph. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Stable minimal perihilar vascular congestion.  No confluent consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
 
 2. Question aortic valvular calcifications, difficult to differentiate from
 lung nodules, would be better assessed on CT.
