 a right pneumonia.  Also bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upper frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided PICC terminates overlying the expected location of the left basilic
 or brachial vein, malpositioned.  Right lateral approach chest tube terminates
 overlying the right lung apex.
 
 There is a moderate right pleural effusion.  There are ill-defined right
 basilar opacities which may be compatible with atelectasis versus an
 infectious process.  There is moderate pulmonary interstitial edema.  There is
 cardiomegaly.  There is no osseous abnormality.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left-sided PICC is malpositioned, overlying the expected location of left
 basilic or brachial vein.
 
 2.  Moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary interstitial edema
 
 3.  Right basilar opacities which may represent atelectasis or an infectious
 process.
