 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ line is been removed.  There is no significant change in the ET
 tube, NG tube, left IJ line.  There continues to be patchy areas of alveolar
 infiltrate bilaterally and hazy vascular redistribution compatible with fluid
 overload.  In addition, there is more dense consolidation in the retrocardiac
 region and right lower lobe.  It is unclear if this is due to the pulmonary
 edema worse there is a superimposed infectious infiltrate.
