                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock, intubated, with pulmonary
 infiltrates  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___ at 21:11, a thin tube overlying the upper
 mediastinum has been retracted -- it previously overlay the lower mediastinum
 and now lies at the level of the carina.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 
 ET tube, NG tube, and right IJ line are unchanged.
 
 There is slight the patient rotation on the current film.  Allowing for this,
 again seen are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, overall quite similar
 to the earlier film.  However, the right hemidiaphragm is slightly better
 defined on today's exam, which could indicate very slight interval improvement
 .  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the parenchymal
 infiltrates.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Extensive pulmonary opacities are overall similar, with possible minimal
 improvement at the right base.
 2. Change in position of the thin tube overlying the mediastinum --___ see
 comment above.  Clinical correlation is requested.
