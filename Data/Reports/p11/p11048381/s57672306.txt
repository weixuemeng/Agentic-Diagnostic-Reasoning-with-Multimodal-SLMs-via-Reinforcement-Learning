                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated for septic shock with pulmonary edema
 // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple lines and tubes are similar to the prior film.
 
 Allowing for changes in the patient position, the left mediastinal border is
 better defined, but no definite change in the cardio mediastinal silhouette is
 identified.
 
 Renewed visualization of left hemidiaphragm suggests an element of clearing at
 the left lung base.  Slight interval clearing of opacity in the upper zones
 may also have occurred.
 
 Nonetheless, again seen is diffuse opacity in both lungs, compatible with
 pulmonary edema.  No gross effusion is identified.  Residual consolidation in
 the left lower lobe is indicated by air bronchograms projecting over the
 retrocardiac region.  No gross effusions identified.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema, with interval improvement of opacities predominantly at the
 left base and, to a lesser extent, in the upper zones.  The possibility of an
 associated infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
