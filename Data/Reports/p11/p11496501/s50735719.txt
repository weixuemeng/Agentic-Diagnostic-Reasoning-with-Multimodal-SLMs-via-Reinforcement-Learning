                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  The lungs are
 low in volume with fullness of the azygos vein and mild interstitial
 prominence which could reflect early pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in
 size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Possible mild pulmonary edema.
