 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right sternoclavicular joint septic
 arthritis.  Preop chest radiograph.

 Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  There is increased sclerosis seen of the right
 sternoclavicular joint which is better assessed on the outside hospital CT
 scan.  There is also some widening and irregularity of the right lateral
 clavicle suggestive of prior old trauma or surgery.  A single metallic anchor
 is seen in the right humeral head.  On the lateral view, there is
 calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament consistent with DISH.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions without signs for cardiopulmonary process.
