                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hematemesis, status post nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.8 cm above the carina.
 The patient has also received a nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is
 unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visible on the current image.  The
 right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
 
 The atelectatic opacity at the right lung base is slightly increasing.  There
 also is a disruption in the air column of the right main bronchus, so that
 bronchoscopic evaluation or clearance of potentially present mucus might be
 indicated.
