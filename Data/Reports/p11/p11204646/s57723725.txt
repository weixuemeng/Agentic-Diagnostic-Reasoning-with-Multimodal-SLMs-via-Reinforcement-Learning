                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biventricular failure, to assess for congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with a study of ___; the area of
 opacification at the right base posteriorly has increased, consistent with
 worsening pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac
 silhouette has increased in size.  However, there is no convincing evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
