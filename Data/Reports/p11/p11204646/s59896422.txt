                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure secondary to
 congestive cardiac failure and acute appendicitis, now with new gastric tube
 placement, evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___ at 7:22 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Right IJ line tip projects over the expected
 region of the upper SVC.  Right-sided PICC tip projects over the expected
 region of the cavoatrial junction.  ET tube is approximately 4.3 cm above the
 carina.  A feeding tube is noted with tip in the expected region of the
 proximal gastric antrum with side ports within the body of the stomach. 
 Severe cardiomegaly is again noted.  Right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged
 from the prior examination.  The opacification at the left lung base is
 unchanged from the most recent prior examination may represent pleural
 effusion with atelectasis, however infectious process such as pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
