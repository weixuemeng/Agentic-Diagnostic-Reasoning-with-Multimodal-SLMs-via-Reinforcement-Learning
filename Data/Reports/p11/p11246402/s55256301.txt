                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___ COMPARED TO PREVIOUS STUDY OF EARLIER THE SAME
 DAY
 
 Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment
 of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the stomach.  Within the chest,
 central venous catheter continues to terminate in the right atrium. 
 Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 improving pulmonary edema.  A more confluent linearly oriented opacity in the
 right lung base also appears improved, and favors atelectasis.  Adjacent right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  Worsening left retrocardiac atelectasis or
 aspiration.
