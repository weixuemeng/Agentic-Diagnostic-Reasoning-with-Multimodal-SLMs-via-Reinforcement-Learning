                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HCAP.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___ and CT chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated in the interim with interval removal
 of a nasogastric tube.  The position of the left internal jugular catheter is
 unchanged.  Overall, there has been interval improvement of the diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal opacities, with persistent mild right basilar opacity.
 Small right pleural effusion is persistent.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema, predominantly in the left
 lung.
 
 2. Persistent right basilar opacity, consistent with patient's known
 pneumonia.
