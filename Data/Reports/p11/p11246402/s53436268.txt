                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Perihilar opacities are seen which may be due to
 some edema over infection, though component of aspiration is not excluded. 
 Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is better assessed on subsequent CT.  The
 aorta is calcified.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although there was
 small pleural effusion on the CT.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. 
 An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not
 included on the image.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not
 included on the image.
 3.  Perihilar opacities may be due to edema; however, infection and/or
 aspiration are not excluded.  Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy better assessed
 on subsequent CT.
