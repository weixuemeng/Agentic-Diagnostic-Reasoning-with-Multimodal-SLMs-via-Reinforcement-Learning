                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o COPD breast ca, here with respiratory
 failure and ongoing hypoxia  // infiltrate? edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the opacity at the right lung base laterally has
 progressed slightly. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is the NG tube extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Also
 again seen is a left IJ central line, tip over the right atrium, unchanged --
 as before, consider retraction by approximately 4 cm to position at in the
 lower SVC.
 
 Suspect background COPD. There is cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution
 and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. No gross effusion.
 Densities overlying the lower thoracic spine are consistent with prior kypho-
 or vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of opacity at the right base. The differential diagnosis includes
 aspiration or a pneumonic infiltrate. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
