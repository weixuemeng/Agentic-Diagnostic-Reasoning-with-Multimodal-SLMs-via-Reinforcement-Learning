                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, suspected lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis, concern for volume overload // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, a left internal jugular catheter terminates deep within the right
 atrium and could be pulled back approximately 6 cm  to reposition in the low
 SVC.  An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina and is in
 appropriate position.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is stable. A previously
 seen right upper lobe opacity is smaller. Vascular congestion is improved.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left internal jugular catheter terminates within the right atrium and could
 be pulled back approximately 6 cm for placement in the low SVC.
 2. Decreased size of the right upper lobe opacity, which may have been related
 to mucoid impaction.
 3. Persistent right basilar opacity consistent with pneumonia.
 4. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 13:15 on ___ by Dr. ___.
