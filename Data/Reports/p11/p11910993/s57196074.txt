                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with worsening CHF and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal images of the chest were obtained.  Two of the images
 demonstrate low lung volumes likely due to poor inspiration.  The other two
 images demonstrate well-expanded lungs.  There appears to be improvement of
 the right base opacification since previous imaging.  The left-sided
 opacification appears similar to previous exams.   There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is no pleural effusion on the right.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is consistent with the previously identified massively unfolded aorta and
 aneurysmal aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta.  Aortic
 calcifications are seen.  The aortic valve has been replaced with a porcine
 valve.  Left basilar opacities prohibit full assessment of the cardiac size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity improved since prior imaging.  Persistent
 left basilar opacity.  Otherwise, essentially unchanged chest radiograph from
 prior imaging.
