                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, history of asthma
 and congestive cardiac failure, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Study is limited by flexed neck with chin
 obscuring upper portions of the lungs.  Within this limitation, the cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes appear slightly more prominent on today's study
 compared to the most recent prior examination which may reflect a combination
 of positioning and AP lordotic view.  Again noted is a markedly unfolded
 thoracic aorta with a right paratracheal opacity (chest CT from ___
 demonstrates an aneurysmal aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic
 aorta).  There is opacification of bilateral lung bases consistent with
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, small on the right and moderate on the left.
 Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval slight prominence of the mediastinal silhouette likely
 accentuated by patient positioning and represents known unfolded thoracic
 aorta and right paratracheal opacity seen on chest CT from ___.
 2.  New bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the
 left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  Underlying infection cannot be
 excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical setting.
 3.  Air-filled loops of bowel not adequately assessed on this image.
