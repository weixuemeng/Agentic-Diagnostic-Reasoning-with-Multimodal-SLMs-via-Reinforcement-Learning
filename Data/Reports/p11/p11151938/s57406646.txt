                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent hospitalization, cough, and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post dual-lead left-sided AICD with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy.  There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting mild edema/vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 quite enlarged.  Difficult to exclude small pleural effusions.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen, although
 opacity at the lung bases projected on the lateral view while may be due to
 overlying soft tissues, consolidation is difficult to exclude.
