 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is
 again moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a similar appearance of upper zone redistribution of
 pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension.  Otherwise,
 the lungs appear clear.  Streaky left posterior basilar opacities on the
 lateral view appear unchanged suggesting atelectasis associated with
 cardiomegaly.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
