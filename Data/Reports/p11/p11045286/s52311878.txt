                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of COPD and
 new cough and sputum production.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ obtained at 1 p.m.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Post-sternotomy wires are stable. 
 There is unchanged interstitial prominence and bilateral small pleural
 effusions.  Overall, no interval change since the prior study demonstrated
 except for questionable minimal progression of interstitial engorgement that
 might be consistent with development of mild interstitial edema.
