                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and COPD, now with shortness of
 breath and productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia, worsening
 edema/effusion, or other acute pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates multiple sternotomy wires
 with the inferior-most wire disrupted, unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is similar in appearance and there is increased vascular
 congestion.  Increased retrocardiac opacity is likely secondary to
 atelectasis, but in the right clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased vascular congestion. 
 
 2.  Increased retrocardiac opacity is likely secondary to atelectasis, but in
 the right clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by ___, MD, to ___
 ___, MS4/___, at ___ on ___.
