                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, increasing O2 requirement, on o2 for
 COPD  // ? pneumonia or other signs of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the hila is stable to slightly increased consistent with
 vascular congestion and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries.  Right
 perihilar opacity is slightly more prominent as compared the prior study,
 which could relate to differences in patient position or underlying pneumonia
 and/ or lymphadenopathy.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis/scarring is noted.  Partially imaged thoracolumbar
 hardware is again noted.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
