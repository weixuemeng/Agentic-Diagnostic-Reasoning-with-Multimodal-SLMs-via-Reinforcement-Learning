                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening sob/doe, hypoxemia. No cough, cp,
 palp, fever  // r/o CHF      WORSENING SOB/DOE,HYPOXEMIA,NO COUGH CHEST
 PAIN,PALPATATIONS OR FEVER R/O CHF,ABNORMALITY
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The chronic consolidative abnormality at the base of the right long, probably
 rounded atelectasis, probably rounded atelectasis, is larger, but I cannot
 distinguish that from new consolidation in either the right middle or lower
 lobe.
 
 Mild, chronic cardiomegaly is larger and pulmonary vessels are more engorged
 but there is no pulmonary edema.  Extensive right-sided pleural thickening is
 probably related to healed right rib fractures.  A spinal stabilization device
 spans the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine but is not assessed by this
 study.
