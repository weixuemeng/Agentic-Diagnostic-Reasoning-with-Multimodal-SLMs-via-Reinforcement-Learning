                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, COPD with dyspnea  // please evaluate for
 acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are several with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis,
 similar to the previous study.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Remote bilateral rib fractures are again noted. 
 Partially imaged is posterior fusion hardware spanning the thoracolumbar
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
