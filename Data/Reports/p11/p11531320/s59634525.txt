 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent sob, wheezing, hypoxemia. no
 fever or cough  // ?RAD, ?CHF
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___, cardiomegaly is accompanied by worsening
 pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. Confluent right
 basilar opacity is similar to prior radiograph and earlier chest x-ray of ___, but appears larger compared to ___. Lungs are
 otherwise remarkable for bibasilar linear scarring. Multiple bilateral healed
 rib fractures are present, and a spinal stabilization devices again
 demonstrated.

 Nonspecific opacity at right cardiophrenic angle is most likely due to chronic
 pleural and parenchymal scarring adjacent to a focal region of diaphragmatic
 eventration. No new areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia
