                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes are low, they are persistent and probably
 atelectatic or potentially fibrotic changes at the right lung base, but there
 is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  This is also evident
 when including more remote radiographs, for example from ___ into the
 comparison.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No
 evidence of pleural effusions on the lateral chest radiograph.
