                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cardiomyopathy status post
 biventricular ICD.  Are the leads in appropriate position?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view chest
 examination of ___.  On the frontal view, the findings are
 unchanged and there is no evidence of any pneumothorax.  Again identified are
 the two standard electrodes in right atrial appendage position and apical
 portion of right ventricle correspondingly.  The third electrode can now be
 located in greater detail with the help of the lateral view.  This third wire
 is also connected with the same left-sided pacer passes along through the
 central venous system and when reaching the right atrium makes an anterior
 gentle curve to return in dorsal direction and apparently entering the venous
 coronary sinus.  It continues for about 3 cm in posterior direction before it
 curves finally with its tip laterally, so that it rests in a posterior lateral
 obtuse marginal vein of the coronary venous system.  Thus, the wire should
 activate region of the posterolateral left ventricle.  Comparison is extended
 to a series of chest examinations in ___.  The degree of cardiomegaly
 appears to be stable.  There is no significant pulmonary vascular congestion
 or any pleural effusion in lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate position of all three endovascular pacer electrodes
 in right atrial appendage, right ventricular apical portion and left
 posterolateral coronary vein to stimulate left ventricle.
