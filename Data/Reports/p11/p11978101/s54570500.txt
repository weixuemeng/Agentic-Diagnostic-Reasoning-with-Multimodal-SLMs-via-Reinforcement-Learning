                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute shortness of breath and rales on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse alveolar opacities
 bilaterally with hazy lung bases, findings consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema and probable bilateral pleural effusions.  There is likely associated
 compressive atelectasis at the bases as well.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Mediastinal contours appear normal.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears similar to
 prior.  The bones remain diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New moderate pulmonary edema with probable bibasilar atelectasis and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly
