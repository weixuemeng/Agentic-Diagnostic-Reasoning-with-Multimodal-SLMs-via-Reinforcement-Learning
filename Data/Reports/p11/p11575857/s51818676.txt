                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheal stenosis and RLL endobronchial
 stenosis  // Evaluate RLL s/p alleviation of obstruction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is new right-sided volume loss
 with apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is likely secondary
 to lower lobe atelectasis.  Superimposed bibasilar opacities are unchanged.
 There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity is likely due to atelectasis. Superimposed aspiration
 or infection cannot be excluded an short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
