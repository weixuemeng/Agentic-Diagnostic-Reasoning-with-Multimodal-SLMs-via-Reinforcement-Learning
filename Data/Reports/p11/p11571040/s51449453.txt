                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, hypoxia  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of right
 basilar consolidation, but appears at least mild to moderately enlarged.  The
 aorta appears mildly tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Consolidative right basilar opacity is highly worrisome for pneumonia, with an
 associated moderate pleural effusion.  Streaky atelectasis also demonstrated
 within the left lung base.  No pneumothorax is clearly identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia with associated
 moderate pleural effusion.  Left basilar atelectasis.
