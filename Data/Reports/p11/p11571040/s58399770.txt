                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the prior
 chest radiograph, but appears similar compared to the prior CT.  Associated
 right basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  A small left
 pleural effusion is likely present.  Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect
 atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the
 large right pleural effusion.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent large right pleural effusion, increased from the prior chest
 radiograph, but similar to the prior chest CT.  Probable small left pleural
 effusion.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
