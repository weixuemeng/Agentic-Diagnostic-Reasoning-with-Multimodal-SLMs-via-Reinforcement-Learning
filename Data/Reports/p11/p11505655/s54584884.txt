                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea status post recent TIPS  // acute
 pulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip remains within the upper SVC.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is similar compared to the previous study.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Streaky opacities within the lung bases persist,
 though appear slightly improved compared to the prior exam likely reflecting
 improving atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted on the
 lateral view. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No pneumothorax or
 acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases are slightly improved from the prior exam
 and likely reflect atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
