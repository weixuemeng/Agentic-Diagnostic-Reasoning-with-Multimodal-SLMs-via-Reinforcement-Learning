                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, oxygen requirements, and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 There are diffusely increased interstital markings in both lungs, more
 pronounced on the right, with more confluent opacity in the right base.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Diffusely increased interstitial markings, R>L, without effusion. The
 differential is broad and clinical correlation is requested for full
 assessment.  In the setting of fever, this could reflect an interstitial
 pneumonia. Follow-up to confirm resolution is recommended.
 
 2) More confluent opacities at the right base could reflect a focal pneumonia.
 
 Differential of interstitial pneumonia  and more diffuse involvement of right
 lung was discussed with covering physician ___ at approximately 9:36
 pm on the day of the exam.
