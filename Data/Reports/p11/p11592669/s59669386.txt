                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent right chest tube removal, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  On the frontal image, there is no convincing evidence for right
 pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  On the lateral radiograph, there is
 mild hyperlucency in the retrosternal lung areas, so that the presence of a
 small anterior pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  Potential minimal remnant
 free intra-abdominal air.  The known bullet in the upper abdomen projects in
 almost unchanged location.
