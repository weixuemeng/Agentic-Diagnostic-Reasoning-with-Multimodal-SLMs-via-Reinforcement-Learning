                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new desat, copious secretions  // ?acute
 process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of ___, perihilar and basilar
 predominant pulmonary opacities have improved on the right and worsened on the
 left.  Such rapid change favors recurrent aspiration and pulmonary edema as
 the most likely etiologies, but continued follow-up would be helpful to
 exclude the possibility of infectious pneumonia.  No other relevant changes
 since recent study.
