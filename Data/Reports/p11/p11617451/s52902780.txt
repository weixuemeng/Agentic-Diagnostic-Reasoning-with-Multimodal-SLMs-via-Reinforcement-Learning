                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAH  // ?edema      ?edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 05:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is increasing opacity in the right mid and lower lung and a stable
 opacity in the left lung with associated cephalization of the vasculature. 
 Given the rapidity of change, this would favor pulmonary edema rather than
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable given
 differences in positioning.  Right internal jugular central line, esophageal
 probe, and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position.  Endotracheal
 tube now has its tip 3 cm above the carina.
