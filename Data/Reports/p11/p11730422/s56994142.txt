                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of new AFib, shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  Retrocardiac lucency with air-fluid level is seen,
 consistent with a likely large hiatal hernia which may also be accentuating
 the cardiac silhouette size in part.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large hiatal hernia which may in part be accentuating the cardiac
 silhouette, which appears larger in size as compared to the prior study, mild
 to moderately enlarged.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion.
