                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left lower lobe resolving pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new or substantially increased on both
 sides of the chest, hard to explain if the patient had unilateral pneumonia. 
 Heart is slightly larger, but the pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is
 no pulmonary edema.  Perhaps the patient received volume resuscitation or has
 issues with hypervolemia.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or cardiac
 decompensation currently, but the lateral film shows there is a very small
 pericardial effusion.
