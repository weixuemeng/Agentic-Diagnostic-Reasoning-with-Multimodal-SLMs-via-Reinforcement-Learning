                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vomiting and diarrhea x 4 days.  Transaminitis, verify port
 placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 COMPARISON: ___ chest x-ray from ___.
 
 A right-sided indwelling catheter is present.  Tip is partially obscured by
 pacemaker leads, but appears to overlie the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is upper zone re-distribution,
 without overt CHF.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  The
 right hemidiaphragm is eventrated.  There is some subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring in the right cardiophrenic region, unchanged compared with ___.
 A small area of lobulated soft tissue density abuts the left chest wall
 inferiorly, new compared with the ___ CXR, and may represent some loculated
 pleural fluid.  
 
 Several small opacities project over both lower lungs -- these may represent
 calcifications within the cartilaginous portions of the ribs, anteriorly.   
 
 Small density over the right upper quadrant could represent either a
 calcification or cholecystectomy clips.  No free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Indwelling catheter tip over mid-SVC.  
 2) Stable opacity in right cardiophrenic region, ?atelectasis/scarring.  
 3) Scattered small densities at both lung bases, not fully characterized, ?
 calcified nodules.  
 4) Pleural thickening and/or fluid at left chest wall inferiorly.  
 5) No focal consolidation to confirm the presence of an aspiration
 pneumonitis.
