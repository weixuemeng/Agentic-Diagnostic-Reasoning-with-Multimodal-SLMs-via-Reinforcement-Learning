                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest tube placed with persistent air leak  //
 reassess chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 07:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar chest tube remains projecting over the right basilar hemi
 thorax.  Extensive subcutaneous gas appear slightly increased from the prior
 study, located within the right lateral chest wall, the neck bilaterally, as
 well as tracking along the pectoralis muscles bilaterally.  No pneumothorax is
 visualized.  Lungs are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes again
 seen in the upper lobes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Remote
 fracture of the right mid clavicle is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar chest tube in similar position without recurrent pneumothorax. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema appears slightly increased in the interval.
