                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sub Q emphysema s/p blebectomy w/
 mechanical/chemical pleurodesis  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 05:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right chest tube is in unchanged position.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 is stable.  Visualized small right basilar pneumothorax is minimally larger,
 likely from change in distribution.  There is no mediastinal shift.  Increased
 interstitial markings in bilateral lung bases likely reflect emphysema and
 superimposed edema.  There is no large pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right lung base pneumothorax is minimally larger compared to 1 hr
 ago, likely a due to change in distribution.
 2. Right chest tube is in unchanged position.  If clinically indicated, the
 position of the chest tube can be better evaluated with CT which will be
 helpful to rule out the possibility of its position in the fissure.
 3. Stable extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
