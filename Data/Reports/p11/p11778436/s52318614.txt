                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bullous emphysema s/p chest tube for
 subcutaneous emphysema  // eval crepitus, bullous emphysema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, widespread subcutaneous
 emphysema persists, reducing the sensitivity for detecting pneumothoraces. 
 With this limitation in mind, a small right apical pneumothorax is probably
 unchanged, and note is made of a questionable small left apical pneumothorax
 as well.  Exam is similar to the recent study except for improving aeration at
 both lung bases.
