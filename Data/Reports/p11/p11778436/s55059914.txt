                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, pneumothorax, worsening hypoxia and
 dyspnea  // eval for interval change in pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.  Chest
 radiograph from approximately 4.5 hours later on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are hyperinflated with lower lobe
 interstitial reticular markings compatible with known COPD and emphysema. 
 There is a large right lower hemithorax pneumothorax, with a possible element
 of tension.  Followup chest radiograph 4.5 hours later demonstrates interval
 chest tube placement with improved lung inflation.  There is unchanged
 subcutaneous emphysema along the chest walls bilaterally and imaged lower
 neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right lower hemithorax pneumothorax, now large.  Chest radiograph
 from 4.5 hours later demonstrates interval placement of a chest tube with
 improved inflation of the right lung.
