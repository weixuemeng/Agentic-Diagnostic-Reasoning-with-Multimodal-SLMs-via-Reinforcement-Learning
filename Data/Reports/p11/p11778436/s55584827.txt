                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known pneumothorax, evaluate after chest
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 06:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed 1 hour earlier, there has been interval
 placement of a chest tube in the right lung base.  The previously noted
 pneumothorax is no longer appreciated.  No pneumothorax on the left.  There
 has otherwise been no significant interval change.  The upper lungs appear
 hyperlucent, related to severe underlying emphysema as demonstrated on the
 recent CT chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 on the current study.
