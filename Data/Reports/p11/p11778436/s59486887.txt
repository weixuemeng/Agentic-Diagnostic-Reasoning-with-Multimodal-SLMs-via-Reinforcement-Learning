                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with delirium, subQ emphysema, COPD, chest tubes
 in place. SEVERE agitation/dyspnea.  // worsening pneumothorax? edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Redemonstrated is extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  This reduces the
 sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax ease.  The right-sided chest tube
 appears to be in slightly changed position, as it may have been pulled back. 
 It may still remain in the chest posteriorly, though definite location is
 difficult to determinate.  Right pneumothorax is likely unchanged.  Possible
 left, small apical pneumothorax may be present.  Again seen are bibasilar
 opacities, not significantly changed since the prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall stable examination since the prior with possible displacement of the
 right-sided chest tube.  Bilateral pneumothoraces do not appear to have
 increased in size.
