  Hyperlucency of the upper lobes speaks to severe emphysema.  There is a
  pleural catheter, unchanged at the right lung base.  Previously mentioned
  small bilateral apical pneumothoraces are poorly seen, no larger.
  There is significant subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, pneumothorax s/p right chest tube
 placement now with desaturation and chest tube leak.  // Worsening
 pneumothorax?     Worsening pneumothorax?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the
 widespread subcutaneous emphysema as well as the small apical pneumothoraces. 
 Pleural catheter is again seen at the right base.  Early mild bibasilar
 increase in opacification appears stable.
