                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new OG placement  // OG confirmation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior portable chest radiographs, most recent from 4
 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from 4 hours earlier, there has been interval
 placement of a orogastric tube that passes into the stomach and out of view. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities have minimally improved. 
 The contribution of asymmetric edema and pneumonia to these opacities is hard
 to say.  There is little change otherwise.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Orogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  NO OTHER CHANGE
 SINCE EARLIER IN THE DAY.
