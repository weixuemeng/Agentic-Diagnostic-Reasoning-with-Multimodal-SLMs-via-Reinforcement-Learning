  Since the prior chest radiograph performed approximately 1 hr earlier, there
  has been interval decrease in size of the right basilar pneumothorax.  No
  pneumothorax on the left.  Hyperlucent appearance of the upper lung is
  consistent with severe emphysema.  Bibasilar opacities may represent a
  combination of atelectasis and/or dependent edema.  No appreciable pleural
  effusion.  Unchanged appearance of right lateral chest wall subcutaneous
  emphysema status post chest tube placement.
