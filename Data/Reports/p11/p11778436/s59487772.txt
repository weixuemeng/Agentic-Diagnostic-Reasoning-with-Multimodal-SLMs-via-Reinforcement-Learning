  Severe extensive, diffuse subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally, which extends
  into the neck and abdomen.
  
  Pneumomediastinum, better assessed on subsequent CT.
  
  Lucency at the right lateral lower chest raises concern for small pneumothorax
  versus bulla.  A right-sided chest tube was subsequently placed.
  
  Bibasilar opacities could be due to infection, aspiration, less likely
  atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ? right sided pneumo  // Eval pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from earlier today, ___ at 10:29.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive, diffuse bilateral subcutaneous emphysema involving the
 chest bilaterally, with extension into the neck, superior extent not included
 on the image.  The subcutaneous emphysema extends inferiorly along the
 bilateral chest walls at least to the upper abdomen, inferior aspect not
 included on the images.  Extensive pneumomediastinum is seen, better assessed
 on subsequent CT.  There are bibasilar opacities which may be due to
 atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.  Subtle lucency at the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a small pneumothorax and/or a large bulla. 
 Lucency of the upper lungs bilaterally is consistent with severe pulmonary
 emphysema.
