                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD now with recurrent pneumothorax s/p CT.
 // please evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.7 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field-of-view. 
 Re- demonstrated is extensive severe bilateral subcutaneous emphysema. 
 Evidence of pneumomediastinum is also re- demonstrated.  Bibasilar opacities
 persist, possibly due to aspiration and/or infection.  It is difficult to
 assess for right-sided pneumothorax can't cannot exclude the presence of a
 small right pneumothorax.  Right chest tube is not well seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right chest tube not well seen.
 
 Persist in extensive, severe diffuse bilateral subcutaneous emphysema.  This
 overlying artifact makes evaluation for small right pneumothorax suboptimal.
 
 Pneumomediastinum.
 
 Persistent bibasilar opacities.
