                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis.  Decreased left-sided breath
 sounds.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The
 patient has been extubated and an enteric tube has been removed.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Vague retrocardiac opacity is not well characterized or
 specific, but would most often be seen with atelectasis.  Pleural effusions
 are difficult to exclude.  There is mild perihilar opacification suggesting
 fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild fluid overload. Vague retrocardiac
 opacity suggesting atelectasis.  PICC line terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.
