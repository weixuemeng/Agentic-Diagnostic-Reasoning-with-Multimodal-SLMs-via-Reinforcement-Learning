                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, intubated in the setting of diabetic
 ketoacidosis.  Evaluate for interval changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube with the distal lead tip 4.4 cm above the
 carina, appropriately sited.  There is a right-sided PICC line with distal
 lead tip at the mid right atrium.  This could be pulled back 2-3 cm for more
 optimal placement.  There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are
 below the GE junction, appropriately sited.  There is again seen a left
 retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions.  This is stable.  There
 is some prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings, which is also
 unchanged.  Low lung volumes are present.  There are no pneumothoraces.
