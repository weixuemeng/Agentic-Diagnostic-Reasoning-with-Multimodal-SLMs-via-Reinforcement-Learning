                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease, acute onset chest pain and dyspnea,
 NSTEMI.  Please assess for congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently outside
 radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are not significantly changed from comparison
 exam.  Cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions are worse.  The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle suggests possible small right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema in the setting of congestive heart
 failure is worse compared to two days prior.
