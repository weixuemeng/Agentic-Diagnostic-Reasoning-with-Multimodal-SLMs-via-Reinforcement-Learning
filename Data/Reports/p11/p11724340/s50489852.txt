                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 13:02 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been some clearing of the linear
 atelectases in the left mid zone.   Again seen is a small left effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  A small right effusion is slightly
 more apparent on the current exam, with some collapse/consolidation at the
 right base that appears to have progressed. Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New or more pronounced small right effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Persistent left small effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Interval clearing of linear atelectasis in the
 left mid zone.
