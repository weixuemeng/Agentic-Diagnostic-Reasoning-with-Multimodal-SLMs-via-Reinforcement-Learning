                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bibasilar crackles and new oxygen
 requirement.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased
 interstitial markings in the bilateral lungs concerning for pulmonary edema. 
 Increased opacification in the retrocardiac region raises concern for
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in interstitial markings raises concern for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with atelectasis or less likely
 pneumonia.
