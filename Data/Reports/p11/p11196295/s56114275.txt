                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Lung volumes are
 low.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view shows
 vague focal opacification projecting over the lower spine; no correlate is
 seen on the frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague posterior lower lobe opacity, not very characteristic of pneumonia,
 although infectious process is possible.  Instead main concern is to exclude a
 nodule; this could be probably be accomplished by repeating the study with
 standard PA and lateral technique with optimal inspiration when clinically
 feasible since this may be due to minor atelectasis or summation artifact.
