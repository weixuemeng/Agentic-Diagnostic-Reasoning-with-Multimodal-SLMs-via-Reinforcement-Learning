                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with studies dating back to ___, there is
 continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette but no evidence of
 congestive failure.
 
 There is an area of ill-defined increased opacification in the right mid zone
 seen posteriorly on the lateral projection.  This has been attributed in the
 past to possible superinfection above a cavitary process.  The overall
 appearance has stayed relatively stable and appears slightly less prominent on
 the current examination.  In view of the protracted course, this most likely
 represents chronic fibrotic change and possible pleural plaquing.  However, if
 there is any serious thought to an acute abnormality, CT would be the next
 imaging procedure.
