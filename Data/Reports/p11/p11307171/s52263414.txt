                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from ladder.  Evaluate for a traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  No pleural effusions, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidations.  Heart size is normal.  There is no definite
 widening of the mediastinum which shows sharp margins.  There is no displaced
 fracture evident.  If concern for an aortic injury persists, cross-sectional
 imaging would be recommended.
