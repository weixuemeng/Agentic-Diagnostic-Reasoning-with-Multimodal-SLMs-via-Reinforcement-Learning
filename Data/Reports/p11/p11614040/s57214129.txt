                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent admission for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in the interval with
 overlying atelectasis.  New right base opacity is seen, may represent
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis with overlying consolidation. 
 Fluid is seen tracking in the minor fissure on the lateral view.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette difficult x-ray
 assessed due to the bibasilar opacities.  The aorta is calcified.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen, with distal tip in the expected location of the right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion slightly increased as compared to the prior
 study.
 
 Interval increase in right base opacity may represent combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.
