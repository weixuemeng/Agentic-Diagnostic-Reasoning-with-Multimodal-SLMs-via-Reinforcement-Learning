                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PEA arrest and newly intubated, question ET tube
 placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, 19:20 a.m.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, an ET tube has been placed.  The tip lies in
 satisfactory position, approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  Increased
 density overlying the trachea at the thoracic inlet is thought to represent
 artifact due to overlying material.  A right IJ central line is present, tip
 overlying distal SVC.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, with tip
 overlying upper RA.  
 
 Hyperinflation raises the question of background COPD.  The cardiac silhouette
 is enlarged, but grossly unchanged.  Curvilinear density extending across the
 right mid lung could represent either plate-like atelectasis or fluid in the
 minor fissure, increased compared to the prior film.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density, without obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, asymmetrically more pronounced on the left
 side.  Equivocal minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of ET tube in satisfactory position.  Other lines as
 described.
 
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Findings suggestive of CHF with interstitial edema.  This is likely
 superimposed on background COPD.
 
 4.  Small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 5.  New fluid or atelectasis in the right mid zone.  No fluid seen in the
 right costophrenic sulcus.
