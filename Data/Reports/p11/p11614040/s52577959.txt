                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New OG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:56 a.m.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, an OG tube has been placed.  The tip extends
 beneath the diaphragm and overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus,
 looping slightly within the stomach.  The ET tube, right IJ line, and
 right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter are largely unchanged.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Left lower lobe opacity is
 unchanged.  Parenchymal markings remain prominent, but appear to have improved
 compared with the earlier film, suggesting some interval improvement in the
 CHF findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  OG tube placed, with tip over fundus.
 2.  Slight interval improvement in CHF findings.
