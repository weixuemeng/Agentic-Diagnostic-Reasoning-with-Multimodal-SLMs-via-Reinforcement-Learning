                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some decrease
 in the still substantial left pleural effusion.  There is a small pleural
 effusion on the right extending into the minor fissure.  The pulmonary
 vascular congestion has essentially cleared.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes
 are present.
 
 Port-A-Cath again extends to the cavoatrial junction or right atrium.
 
 The possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
