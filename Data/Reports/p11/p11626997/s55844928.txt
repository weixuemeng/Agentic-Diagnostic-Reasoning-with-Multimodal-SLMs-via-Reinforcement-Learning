                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with progrssive dyspnea, likel CHF, would like to r/o
 infiltrate  // infilrate? edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to low lung volumes and overlying soft tissues, the
 lateral view is particularly limited due to patient's arms overlying the
 thoracic cavity.
 
 There is no large confluent consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.  Posterior
 costophrenic angles are not well seen potentially technical although
 underlying effusions are possible.  Median sternotomy wires are noted. Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications as well as probable coronary artery stents are
 seen. No acute osseous abnormalities. Multiple surgical clips seen in the
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Densities at the posterior costophrenic angles potentially in
 part technical and due to overlying soft tissues although underlying effusion
 or other process would be difficult to exclude.  No definite correlate
 identified on the frontal view.
