                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:41
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question volume overload.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 9:56.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 9:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been prior median sternotomy.  The heart remains enlarged, which may
 reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely
 excluded.  There has been interval improvement in aeration.  However, there is
 fullness OF the perihilar vasculature suggesting mild perihilar and
 interstitial edema.  No large effusions are seen.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac area could reflect
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also
 be considered.  Clinical correlation is advised.
