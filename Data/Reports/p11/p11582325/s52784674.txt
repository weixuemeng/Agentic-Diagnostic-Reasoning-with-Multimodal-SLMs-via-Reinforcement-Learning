                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  chest frontal lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dizziness and some chest pain for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lung
 volumes are relatively low.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is somewhat tortuous.  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  No definite focal consolidation is seen; however, it is difficult
 to exclude a tiny amount of vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette; however, the cardiac silhouette appears top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  No definite focal consolidation.
