 HISTORY:  Fever with recent pacemaker placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Dual-channel pacemaker device remains in place.  There is
 indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the base and
 there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle that could reflect small
 effusion or pleural thickening.
