                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 which may account for the increasing prominence of a pulmonary vascularity. 
 However, there may well be some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild
 bibasilar opacifications could reflect pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia could not
 be definitely excluded.
