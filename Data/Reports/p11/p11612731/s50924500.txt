                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial flutter, on amiodarone.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, a dual-channel pacemaker device
 remains in place.  Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits
 and there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 No prominence of interstitial markings that would suggest amiodarone toxicity.
