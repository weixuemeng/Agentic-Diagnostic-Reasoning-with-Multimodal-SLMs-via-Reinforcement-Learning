                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation  // PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, new left perihilar and basilar
 alveolar opacities have developed as well as a questionable patchy opacity at
 the right lung base.  Acute aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia
 should be considered, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in
 this regard.  No other relevant changes.
