                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infiltrate in a patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and somewhat hypoinflated lungs.  There is mildly increased opacity
 in the left lung base, without definite correlating consolidation on lateral
 view. This may be atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the left lung base, which could be atelectasis, but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
