                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aspiration, assess consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Scoliotic
 deformity results in a partially rotated appearance of the chest.  There is
 elevated left hemidiaphragm.  There is a band-like opacity at the right lung
 base which could represent a small focus of aspiration in the right clinical
 setting.  There is also mild coarsening of reticular interstitial markings
 which could indicate mild interstitial edema versus chronic interstitial
 fibrotic changes.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is
 grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study with vague band-like opacity at the right lung
 base, which could in the right clinical setting represent a focus of
 aspiration.  Possible mild interstitial edema versus chronic interstitial
 fibrotic change.
