 is a new finding and is incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph
 EXAMINATION. Exam is otherwise similar to the prior study except for
 resolution of minor right basilar atelectasis, and worsening left retrocardiac
 opacification which could be due to worsening atelectasis and or infectious
 pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study.
