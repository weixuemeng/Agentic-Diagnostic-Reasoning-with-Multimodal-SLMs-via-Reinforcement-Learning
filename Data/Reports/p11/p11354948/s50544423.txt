 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:55 PM
  ET tube now 7.4 cm above the carina, has retracted by 2 cm compared to prior.
  Consider advancing by 3 cm to be in more secure position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Movement trying to dislodged tube.  Question OG and ET tube
 movement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:00.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube ending 7.4 cm above
 the carina, which is retracted by approximately 2 cm from the prior study. 
 The OG tube passes below the diaphragm with the side hole within the stomach. 
 The tip is not visualized on this study.  Otherwise no change in heart size
 with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral rib
 fractures better demonstrated on previous CT. Thickening of the right apical
 pleural line "apical cap" is unchanged from prior study, consistent with
 pleural effusion, likely hemothorax from rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube now 7.4 cm above the carina, has retracted by 2 cm.
 2. Thickening of the right apical pleural line "apical cap," unchanged from
 prior study, consistent with small apical pleural effusion, likely hemothorax
 from rib fracture.
