                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Marked cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion
 and an apparent asymmetrical edema pattern involving the right lung to a
 greater degree than the left.  Moderate, partially loculated right pleural
 effusion is again demonstrated as well as a small left pleural effusion. 
 Volume loss in right hemithorax is also similar to the prior study.  This
 appears to be longstanding when comparison is made to older chest radiograph
 dating back to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  CHF with apparent asymmetrical pattern of edema.  Followup radiographs
 after diuresis may be helpful to exclude other process such as pneumonia in
 the right lung.
 2.  Moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion and small left
 pleural effusion.
