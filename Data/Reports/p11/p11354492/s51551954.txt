                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Disorientation, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is a
 posteriorly pleural-based opacity in the right lower lung which is stable from
 multiple prior exams, likely reflecting known loculated pleural effusion and
 rounded atelectasis.  There is slight rightward shift of midline structures
 likely due to the chronic atelectasis within the right lung base.  Otherwise,
 the lungs are clear.  Heart size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal contour
 appears normal, though aorta is slightly unfolded.  The bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chronic opacity at the right lung base likely reflecting a
 combination of loculated effusion and rounded atelectasis.  No significant
 interval changes.
