                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, chills.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is redemonstration of a pleural-based opacity in the right lower lung
 which appears stable from prior examination and likely reflects a loculated
 pleural effusion. There is rightward shift of midline structures likely due to
 chronic atelectasis and continued volume loss at the right lung base. There is
 a new small left sided pleural effusion. The heart is mildly enlarged and
 there is new mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 IMPRESSION: New small left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Stable posteriorly loculated moderate size right pleural effusion
 and atelectasis of the right lung base.
