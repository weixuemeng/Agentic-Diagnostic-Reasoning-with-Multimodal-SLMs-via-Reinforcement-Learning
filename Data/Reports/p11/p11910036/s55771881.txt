                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is a subtle bilateral interstitial abnormality that is more prominent
 centrally than peripherally.  There is also evidence of Kerley B lines along
 the lateral aspect of the right lower chest wall.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not
 significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Of note, an atypical infectious process, particularly one that is viral in
 nature, could have a similar appearance.
