                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with CHF, presenting with persistent
 cough, evaluate for infiltrates or increased vascular congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Again, marked cardiac enlargement is present.  There is no
 typical configurational abnormality, but the most impressive abnormality is a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly.  The
 thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated, but no local contour
 abnormalities or wall calcifications are identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no
 evidence of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema.  The lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulations.  No
 pneumothorax is present in the apical area and no acute discrete parenchymal
 infiltrates can be identified.  As on previous examinations, there exists a
 moderately sized colonic interposition between liver and diaphragm on the
 right base.  Comparison with the next preceding examination, the cardiomegaly
 appears stable.  However, the pulmonary vascular congestive pattern from the
 previous examination has improved and presently no signs of congestion are
 seen, short of a moderate upper zone redistribution pattern in the lungs.
 
 Review of our records shows that the patient has undergone multiple chest
 examinations over the last ___ years with evidence of successively increasing
 heart size.
