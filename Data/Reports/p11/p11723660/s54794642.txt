                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Again seen within the right lower lobe
 is an approximately 2 cm rounded mass, perhaps slightly larger compared to the
 prior CT and new from the prior chest radiograph, and compatible with
 metastasis.  Remainder of the lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild to moderate degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of right lower lobe pulmonary metastasis, perhaps larger
 compared to the prior CT.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
