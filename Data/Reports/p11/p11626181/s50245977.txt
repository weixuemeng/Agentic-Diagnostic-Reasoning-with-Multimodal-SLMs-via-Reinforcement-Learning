                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aspiration one week ago.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 13:04.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:22 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement in aeration at the right base.  Persistent consolidative opacity
 at the left lower lobe suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration.  Coarsened
 interstitium may reflect age-related changes or small airways disease, less
 likely an atypical infection.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Small left effusion.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 Calcifications in the left lateral neck soft tissues likely are carotid in
 etiology.
