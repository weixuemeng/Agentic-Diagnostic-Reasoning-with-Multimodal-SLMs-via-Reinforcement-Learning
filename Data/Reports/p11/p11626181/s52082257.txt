                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, are present.  A retrocardiac
 opacity may represent an area of infection or aspiration pneumonia. 
 Additionally, peribronchial cuffing and increased interstitial markings are
 noted primarily within the right upper lobe, but also to a lesser degree
 within the left upper lung field.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with
 retrocardiac consolidative opacity, which could represent area of  pneumonia
 or aspiration.
 
 2.  Mild peribronchial cuffing and increased interstitial markings within the
 upper lobes, right greater than left, may reflect mild vascular congestion or
 an infectious process.
