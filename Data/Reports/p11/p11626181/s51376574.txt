                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, abd pain  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and chest CT on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top size normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with
 emphysema.  The frontal view demonstrates a 1.2 cm nodular opacity projecting
 over the right upper lobe, not significantly changed in size from ___.  As before, there is a 2.5 cm nodule projecting over the mid thoracic
 spine seen best on the lateral view, also unchanged from the prior radiograph.
 Increased density at the apex of the right lung is consistent with a large
 consolidated mass lesion with punctate calcification, better appreciated from
 CT in ___.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No new
 focal consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules as described above are grossly stable from ___ chest radiograph.  Consider nonurgent chest CT for further
 evaluation when clinically indicated of multiple pulmonary nodules.
 
 No acute intra thoracic process identified.
