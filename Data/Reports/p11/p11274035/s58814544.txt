                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Lungs are
 hyperinflated with streaky linear opacity in the lingula compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 small right pleural effusion. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated. Multilevel mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine along with S-shaped scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion.
