                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with afib w rvr  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy left base opacity raises concern for atelectasis and overlapping
 vascular structures, but pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles is chronic.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left base opacity may be due to combination of atelectasis and
 overlying vascular structures but pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
