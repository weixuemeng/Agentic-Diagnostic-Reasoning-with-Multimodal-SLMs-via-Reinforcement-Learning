                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall and dementia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Posterior left base opacity is seen which may be due to infection
 or aspiration, underlying contusion is not entirely excluded.  There is
 minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which may be due to
 relative flattening of the diaphragms, although trace pleural effusions are
 not excluded.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Costochondral calcifications are noted.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior basilar opacity, best seen on the lateral view could be
 due to infection or aspiration, underlying contusion not excluded.  Minimal
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, trace pleural effusion not
 excluded.
