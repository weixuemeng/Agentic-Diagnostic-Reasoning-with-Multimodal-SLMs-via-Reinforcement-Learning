                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright semi-erect and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Vomiting and elevated lactate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lateral left
 base opacity is similar in appearance as compared to the prior study and could
 represent chronic scarring and/or relate to overlying soft tissue.  Underlying
 aspiration not excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 There is flattening of the diaphragm, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
