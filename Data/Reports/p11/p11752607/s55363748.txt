                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Shortness of breath and back pain.  Evaluation for pneumonia
 and CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are very low which limits the evaluation.  Right
 perihilar opacity could represent crowding of normal bronchovascular
 structures or a focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Cervical spine hardware is noted. 
 The soft tissues and bones appear normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity could represent crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures or less likely pneumonia. Mild cardiomegaly.
