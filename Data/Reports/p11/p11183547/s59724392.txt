                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alcohol withdrawal seizure, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___, there is new patchy opacity at both lung bases.  As
 before, the right hemidiaphragm is eventrated.  There is relative elevation
 and lateralization of the left hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely grossly unchanged, with marked unfolding of the
 descending aorta and aortic calcification. As before, underlying aortic
 dilatation cannot be excluded. No CHF.  Low inspiratory volumes present. 
 Degenerative changes of the left shoulder again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low inspiratory volumes, but with bibasilar patchy opacities that
 are new compared with ___.  The differential diagnosis includes
 infectious and inflammatory infiltrates including signs of aspiration
 pneumonia.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle without gross effusion.
 No CHF.
