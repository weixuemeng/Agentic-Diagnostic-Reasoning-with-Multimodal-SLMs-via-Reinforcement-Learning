                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with flash pulmonary edema, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 22:22.
 
 CHEST, AP SUPINE:  New endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm from the carina,
 and nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Progressive severe perihilar
 pulmonary opacification, likely edema, obscures the consolidation of the right
 lower lung.  Mediastinum also appears more prominent at 8.7 cm, previously 8
 cm.  No significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET and NG tubes in standard position.
 2.  Increasing pulmonary edema, concurrent aspiration pneumonia.
 3.  Prominent appearance of mediastinum, likely secondary to volume overload;
 however edema could have substantial non-cardiac component, such as
 hypotension-induced alveolar damage.  Please refer to subsequent CT for
 further details.
