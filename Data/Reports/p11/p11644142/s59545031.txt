                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Unspecified.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  At the bases, partially in the
 retrocardiac lung area, a relatively large parenchymal opacity is seen.  This
 opacity is located in the left lower lobe, as documented by the lateral image.
 The opacity is ill defined and has subtle air bronchograms.  There is blunting
 of the lateral costophrenic sinus, potentially representing a small pleural
 effusion.  Overall, the morphology is suspicious for pneumonia.  If the
 clinical history is not typical for an infectious disease, pulmonary embolism
 could also be considered as a differential diagnosis.
 
 At the time of observation and dictation, 1:41 p.m., on ___, the
 referring physician was contacted by telephone and the findings were discussed
 between Dr. ___ ___ Dr. ___.
