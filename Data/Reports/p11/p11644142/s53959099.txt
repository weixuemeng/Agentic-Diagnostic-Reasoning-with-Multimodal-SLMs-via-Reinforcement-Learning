                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with incomplete resolution of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Aside from small bands of atelectasis in the left mid lung, lungs are clear
 and there has been a substantial enough resolution of the pneumonia present in
 ___ that there is no indication for followup chest radiographs.  However, just
 lateral to a non-united fracture of the anterior right sixth rib is the
 suggestion of a 9 mm nodule projected over the interspace.  This may
 correspond to one of several subpleural nodules seen on a torso CT, ___, but not routinely visible on subsequent radiographs.
