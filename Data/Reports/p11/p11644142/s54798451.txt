                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia previously
 diagnosed.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is substantial improvement in left lower lobe and lingular pneumonia. 
 Minimal linear opacities most likely reflect scarring and should be
 reevaluated in four weeks for documentation of complete resolution.  Rest of
 the lungs is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are unremarkable.
