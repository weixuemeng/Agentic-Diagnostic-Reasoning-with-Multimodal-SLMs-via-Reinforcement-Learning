                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoglycemia.  History of prostate cancer.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are indistinct pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  More confluent bibasilar opacities
 are seen in part due to right greater than left pleural effusions with
 possible underlying atelectasis or consolidation.   Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged given differences in technique.  Diffusely increased
 sclerosis of the bones is compatible with widespread metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral effusions, right greater than left with probable underlying
 atelectasis and possible consolidation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Diffuse sclerosis of the bones compatible with metastatic disease.
