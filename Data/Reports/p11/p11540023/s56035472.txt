                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  The cardiomediastinal and pulmonary structures are
 unremarkable.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle may represent a
 tiny pleural effusion, which is unchanged from prior studies.  Diaphragms are
 flattened, compatible with chronic obstructive lung disease.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is no pneumothorax or
 consolidation to suggest infection.  There are mild degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine.  The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
