                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hyoxia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multifocal regions of consolidation are noted, most extensive in the left
 lower lung and in the retrocardiac region.  Less conspicuous right perihilar
 opacities are also seen.  Findings are compatible with pneumonia in the proper
 clinical setting.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multi focal regions of consolidation predominately in the left lung compatible
 with infection in the proper clinical setting.  Repeat after treatment
 suggested to document resolution.
