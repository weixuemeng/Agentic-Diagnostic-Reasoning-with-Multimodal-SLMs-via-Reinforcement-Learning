                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting for preoperative exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Detailed evaluation of the lung apices is slightly limited due to overlying
 soft tissue from the chin.  Nonspecific opacities in the retrocardiac region
 are much improved.  Persistent linear opacities in the left retrocardiac
 region may reflect linear atelectasis and/or scarring.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Median
 sternotomy wires appear intact and unchanged.  Posterior spinal fixation
 hardware in the lumbar spine appear grossly intact.  Calcifications of the
 aorta are extensive.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
