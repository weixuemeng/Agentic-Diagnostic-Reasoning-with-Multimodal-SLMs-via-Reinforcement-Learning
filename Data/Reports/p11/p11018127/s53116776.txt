                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and neurologic changes. Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___ tear
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate sternal wires and a
 partially imaged cervical and lumbar fixation hardware. Lung volumes are low,
 with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  A retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and again may represent
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, but superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
 2. Low lung volumes with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.
