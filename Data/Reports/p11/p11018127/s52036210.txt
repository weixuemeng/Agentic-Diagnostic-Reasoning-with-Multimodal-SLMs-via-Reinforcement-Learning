                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and phlegm  // pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, nonspecific left retrocardiac
 opacities have partially cleared.  No new areas of consolidation are
 identified to suggest a new source of infection, but standard PA and lateral
 radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lungs if
 clinical suspicion for pneumonia persists.
