                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with metastatic melanoma, with poor p.o. intake and
 hypotension, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 Increased opacity is present in the left lower lobe with a small left pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is fully expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Left lower lobe opacity which may be due to atelectasis but a supervening
 pneumonia must be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
