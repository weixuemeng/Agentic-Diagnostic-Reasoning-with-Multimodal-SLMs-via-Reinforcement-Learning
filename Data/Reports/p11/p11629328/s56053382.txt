                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is slight
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is left mid and lower lung
 atelectasis, plate-like and likely compressive.  The right lung is clear.  No
 definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  There is a metallic density projecting
 over the posterior soft tissues in the mid back, possibly representing a
 foreign body measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm.  Faint aortic calcifications are
 present.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Mild left hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation with associated left lower lung atelectasis.  Apparent foreign body
 in the soft tissues of the mid back appears metallic, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x
 1.1 cm.  Correlate for prior injury in this region.
