                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T cell lymphoma now with Afib with RVR ?
 of ___ to pulmonary edema, + > 6L  // Please comment on evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung bases are suboptimally evaluated due to low lung volumes. Hazy
 increased opacities in the bases could potentially be due to overlying soft
 tissues of the chest wall, or may reflect small pleural effusions with or
 without adjacent basilar lung opacification. When the patient's condition
 permits, a repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level would be helpful.
