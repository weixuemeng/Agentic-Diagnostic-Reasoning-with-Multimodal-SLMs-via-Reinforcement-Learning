                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest and epigastric pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip appears to terminate within
 the proximal right atrium. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacity within the left
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Posterior fusion hardware is again
 noted within the upper thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable left basilar atelectasis.
