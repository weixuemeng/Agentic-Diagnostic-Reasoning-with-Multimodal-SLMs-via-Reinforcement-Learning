                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The aortic arch is calcified. 
 There is a convex contour to the upper right mediastinum with a smooth outer
 contour; most often, this appearance is due to tortuosity of the great vessels
 and appears benign.  Aside from streaky left basilar opacity suggesting
 atelectasis, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion on the
 right.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect a minimal
 effusion on the left side, however.  Moderate degenerative changes affect the
 partly imaged upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusion and suspected minor atelectasis
 at the left lung base.
