                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for fluid overload in a patient with a history of CHF,
 now with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates slightly lower lung volumes
 with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Allowing for this and differences in technique, heart size is
 likely unchanged.  There is increased opacity overlying the bilateral lower
 lobes, with evidence of a small left pleural effusion, consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  A right pleural effusion is trace, if any.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No definite focal consolidation is seen, though the presence of
 underlying consolidation at the left base would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Old healed right sided rib fractures again noted.  Clips projecting over the
 left axilla are unchanged.  The visualized upper abdomen is grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly, grossly unchanged.
 2. CHF with interstitial and mild alveolar edema, with a small left pleural
 effusion and underlying left base collapse/consolidation.
