                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST SINGLE VIEW:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with low oxygen saturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  No prior.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Linear opacity at the left lung base is suggestive of
 atelectasis.  There is a focal approximately 1-cm opacity projecting over the
 right upper lung and the anterior second rib.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Focal opacity
 projecting over the right lung for which two-view chest x-ray is suggested on
 nonurgent basis to further evaluate.
