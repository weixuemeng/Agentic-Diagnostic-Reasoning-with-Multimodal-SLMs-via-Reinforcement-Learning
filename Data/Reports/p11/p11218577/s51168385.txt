                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for cardiomegaly or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle as before.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The
 mediastinal contours remain prominent with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 and calcification of the aortic knob, which is stable.  Reticular nodular
 opacities predominantly in the lower lobes on the right greater than the left
 likely reflect chronic interstitial changes.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax on this single
 frontal view.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Bibasilar reticular nodular opacities on the right greater than the left
 may be reflective of a chronic interstitial process.  Further evaluation with
 high-resolution CT chest could be considered.
