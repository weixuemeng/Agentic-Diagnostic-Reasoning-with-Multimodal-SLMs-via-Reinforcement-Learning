                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fevers, headache,
 elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes.  The lateral view is underpenetrated due to patient body
 habitus.  Slight right base opacification more likely relates to low lung
 volumes and atelectasis, but an early consolidation cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Right paratracheal soft tissue may
 relate to prominent vascular structures or mediastinal lipomatosis given
 patient body habitus.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Hilar contours
 are unremarkable.
