                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with past smoking history,
 nonproductive cough for 10 days, decreased breath sounds on examination on
 left base and new left anterior cervical node.  Stat report requested to page
 # ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 considered to be within normal limits.  No configurational abnormalities
 identified.  The thoracic aorta mildly widened and shows wall calcifications
 but there is no local contour abnormality.  The aorta follows the course of
 the mild S-shaped scoliosis seen in the thoracic spine.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  A right-sided
 permanent pacer in anterior axillary position is connected to two
 intervascular electrodes terminating in right atrial and right ventricular
 position correspondingly.  The positions are unchanged.
 
 When comparison is made with the next previous chest examination, findings are
 stable and thus there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrate which could explain patient's cough for 10 days, neither is there
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Page was sent to # ___ as
