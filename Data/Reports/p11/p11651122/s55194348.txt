                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Persistent cough, crackles at the right base, history of
 positive PPD.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  There is obscuration of the AP window, could be due
 to enlargement of the pulmonary artery and/or lymphadenopathy.  Bilateral
 peripheral reticular opacities are of unknown chronicity and etiology.  There
 is no evidence of lower pneumonia.  There are extensive degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 CT is recommended to evaluate all the above findings.
