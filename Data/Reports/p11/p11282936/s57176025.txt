 lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  Right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Bowel loops within the left upper quadrant the abdomen are distended
 with gas.
