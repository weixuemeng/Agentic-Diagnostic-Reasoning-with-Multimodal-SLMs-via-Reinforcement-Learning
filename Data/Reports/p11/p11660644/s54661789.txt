                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pedal edema and history of mitral
 valve regurgitation, now with mechanical valve prosthesis.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The patient is status post sternotomy. 
 Within the normal-appearing heart, the metallic components of a right
 bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is identified.  The position is
 unchanged.  The heart size remains within normal limits.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates anywhere in the lungs.  The lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free, and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  In
 comparison with the next preceding study of ___, no significant
 interval change can be identified.  Our records include now a total of six
 followup chest examinations beginning in ___.  At that time, the
 patient already had received the mitral valve prosthesis and the chest
 findings have continuously remained within normal limits.  There is no
 evidence of acute pneumonia or pleural effusion.
