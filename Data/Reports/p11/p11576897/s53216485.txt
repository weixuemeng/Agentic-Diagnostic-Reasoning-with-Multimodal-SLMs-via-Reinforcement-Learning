  There are apparent worsening opacities in the left upper lobe which may be

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man requiring post op intubation  // ? sob      ? sob
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is an placement of an endotracheal
 tube with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  The clinical note
 states that the endotracheal tube has been removed by the time of this
 dictation.
 Increased opacification bilaterally exacerbated by the low lung volumes. 
 Although much of this probably represents pulmonary edema in a patient with
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be seriously considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Increased retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm
 is consistent with pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
