 peripherally.  Some pulmonary edema may be present but the bulk of pulmonary
 abnormality is pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Cardiomegaly is mild. 
 Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.

 cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric drainage tube might not go beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction where vascular clips denote prior surgery.
