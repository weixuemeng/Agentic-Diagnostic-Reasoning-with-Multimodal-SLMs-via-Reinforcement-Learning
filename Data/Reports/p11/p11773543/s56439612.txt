 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:45 PM
  Compared to the prior chest radiograph performed 12 hours prior the air space
  opacities and interstitial edema have improved. Small left pleural effusion
  persists. Nodular opacities in the right upper lobe could represent infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening hypoxia, prior xray with
 ?multifocal pna vs. pulmonary edema, now s/p diuresis but worsening  // eval
 for interval change, ?difference in pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been some
 improvement in the prominence of indistinct interstitial markings consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Nevertheless, there is some continued
 evidence of vascular engorgement.  Left basilar opacification is unchanged,
 consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 
 
 More focal area of opacification in the right upper zone could reflect an
 infectious process.
