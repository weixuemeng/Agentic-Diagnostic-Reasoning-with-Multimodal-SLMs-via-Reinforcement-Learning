                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  Metastatic disease. Question
 pneumonia, edema, or other acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  There is blunting of
 the right lateral costophrenic angle compatible with an effusion.  Apparent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may also be due to component of
 subpulmonic effusion.  There is right basilar atelectasis with underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  Nodular opacities seen at bilateral lung bases
 and right apex.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for mild degenerative changes
 at the left acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm vs possible subpulmonic effusion. 
 Associated right base atelectasis vs possible consolidation.
 2.  Bilateral nodules suspicious for metastatic disease given history. 
 Correlate with prior imaging.
