                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Previously seen right-sided PICC
 is no longer seen.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac
 valve replacements.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  Trace right
 pleural effusion may also be present.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette, small pleural effusions and pulmonary edema
 suggest fluid overload possibly due to CHF.
