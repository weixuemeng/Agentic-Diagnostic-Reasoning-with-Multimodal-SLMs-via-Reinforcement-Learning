 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic and mitral

 terminating in the right ventricle, unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, similar compared to the previous exam.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are noted, with interval
 increase in the amount of pleural fluid on the left.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted. 
 Several clips are demonstrated within the upper abdomen.
