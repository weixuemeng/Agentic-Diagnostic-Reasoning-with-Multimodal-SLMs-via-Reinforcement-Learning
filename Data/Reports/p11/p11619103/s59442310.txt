                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper chest pain after fall.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and
 normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process and no gross evidence of rib
 fracture.  This study is not tailored for the detection of rib fractures.  If
 there is continued clinical concern, dedicated rib series with a skin marker
 could be obtained.
