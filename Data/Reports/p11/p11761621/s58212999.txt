                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  AgA mild interstitial abnormality is similar to improved.  There is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, and allowing for differences in technique, not significantly
 changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Similar to improved mild interstitial abnormality; vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema could be considered versus airway inflammation. 
 
 
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
