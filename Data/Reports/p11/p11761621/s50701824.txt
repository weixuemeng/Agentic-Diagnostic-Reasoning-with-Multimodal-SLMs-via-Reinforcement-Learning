                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and slightly
 increased compared to the previous exam.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  A focal patchy opacity is seen within the
 right lower lobe, which could reflect an area of atelectasis or infection.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and patchy right
 lower lobe on opacity which may reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is not
 excluded.
