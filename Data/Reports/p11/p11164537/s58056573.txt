                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about
 5.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  A
 ventriculoperitoneal catheter courses across the chest.
 There are substantial bilateral pleural effusions and associated opacities
 which are not specific, although most commonly due to atelectasis.  There is
 no pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial pleural effusions and basilar opacities, non-specific
 but probably compatible with atelectasis; infectious processes cannot be
 excluded however.
