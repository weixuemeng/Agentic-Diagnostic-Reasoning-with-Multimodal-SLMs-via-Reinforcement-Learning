                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lightheadedness, new brain lesions on CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Azygos fissure is noted along the medial right upper hemithorax. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 The hila are slightly prominent, but not specifically and do not appear
 prominent on the lateral view.  No large pulmonary mass is seen, although CT
 is more sensitive.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Hilar prominence is
 nonspecific and not substantiated on the lateral view.  No large pulmonary
 mass is seen, although, CT is more sensitive.  Potential hilar prominence
 would also be better evaluated on CT.
