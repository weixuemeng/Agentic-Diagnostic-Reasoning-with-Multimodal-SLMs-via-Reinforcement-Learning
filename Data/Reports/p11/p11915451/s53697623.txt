                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A left-sided
 dialysis catheter is seen taking a sharp curve and coursing posteriorly in the
 thorax.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, which is stable.  Underlying trace pleural effusion
 not excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Vascular stent is again noted in the left brachiocephalic vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central dialysis catheter courses posteriorly in the chest and is
 not along the expected course of the SVC nor does it overlie the right atrium.
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:55 p.m., two
 minutes after discovery via telephone by Dr. ___.
 The catheter does not appear to terminate in the SVC or right atrium, but may
 be within a large azygous vein.
