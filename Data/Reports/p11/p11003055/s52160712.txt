                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fevers.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax or focal air space consolidation.  Equivocal pleural effusions
 are noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable, and the heart
 size is accentuated by the low lung volumes, but is likely normal.  Residual
 enteric contrast material was seen within loops of bowel in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal bilateral pleural effusions.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary pathology.
