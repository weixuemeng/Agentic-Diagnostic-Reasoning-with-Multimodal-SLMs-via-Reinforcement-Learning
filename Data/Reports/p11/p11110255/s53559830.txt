                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Query infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 There is a relatively poor inspiratory effort.  Allowing for this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and the lungs appear grossly
 clear.  Some degenerative change is noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No definitive acute findings.
