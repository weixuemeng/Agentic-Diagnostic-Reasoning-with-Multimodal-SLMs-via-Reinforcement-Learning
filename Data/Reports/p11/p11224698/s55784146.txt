                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, consistent with restrictive physiology in
 this patient with diffuse fibrotic lung disease.  Peripheral and basilar
 predominant pulmonary fibrosis appear similar to the prior radiograph, and has
 been more fully characterized on CT of ___.  A more confluent area
 of opacity is present posteriorly overlying the mid-to-lower thoracic spine
 and corresponds to a left infrahilar mass on prior CT.  Based upon comparison
 of the scout radiograph with the scout from the prior CT scan, the mass
 appears to have enlarged since ___.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance in this patient status post previous median sternotomy
 and coronary artery bypass surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Similar radiographic appearance of pulmonary fibrosis and large left
 infrahilar lung mass, the latter consistent with history of lung cancer.  No
 definite superimposed infectious pneumonia, but CT may be helpful for more
 complete assessment in this patient with extensive baseline abnormalities.
 
 2.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, which have been more fully
 evaluated by CT and PET CT.
