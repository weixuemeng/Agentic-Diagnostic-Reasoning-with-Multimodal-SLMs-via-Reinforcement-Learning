                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of metastatic melanoma, to evaluate
 disease status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lung volumes are low.  Again seen are  bilateral interstitial
 and subpleural reticular opacities predominantly seen in the lung bases,
 consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia, may have slightly progressed
 since the earlier study of ___. Known small upper lobe pulmonary nodules
 are not visualized in this chest radiograph.  No new masses, consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple intact sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal surgical clips relate to prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Known interstitial lung disease, likely UIP.
 2.  No new metastatic disease.  Known small pulmonary nodules are not seen in
 this study.  
 A CT chest can be performed to assess progression of both ILD and pulmonary
 nodules.
