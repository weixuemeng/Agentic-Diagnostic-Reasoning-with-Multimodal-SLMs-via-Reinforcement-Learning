 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Lung volumes are low.  Increased interstitial
 markings seen diffusely throughout the lungs are similar compared to prior. 
 There is no superimposed consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are noted. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for hypertrophic changes of the
 spine and surgical clips in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings as seen on prior, suggestive of chronic underlying lung
 disease.
