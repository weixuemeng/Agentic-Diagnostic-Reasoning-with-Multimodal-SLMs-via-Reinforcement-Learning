                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Melanoma, to assess for disease status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there again are diffuse
 reticular changes bilaterally consistent with fibrotic lung disease.  This
 makes it extremely difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed metastatic
 nodule.  If there is strong clinical suspicion for metastasis, CT would be
 necessary to exclude it.
