                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  As compared to the prior examination, there has
 been an interval increase in the degree of prominence of the interstitial
 markings, compatible with an acute on chronic process.  There is no lobar
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The patient is
 status post CABG and sternotomy wires are intact and well aligned.  Chronic,
 mild cardiomegaly is present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased prominence of interstitial markings, compatible with an acute
 process overlying the patient's known chronic pulmonary fibrosis, possibly
 secondary to vascular congestion versus an acute inflammatory process.  A
 diffuse overlying infectious process is felt to be less likely.  
 
 2.  Status post CABG with chronic mild cardiomegaly.
