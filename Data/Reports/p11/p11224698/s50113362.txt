 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of
 pneumonia on the current image.  However, the lung volumes are low with
 reticular changes bilaterally with peripheral predominance.  Overall, the
 chest radiographic findings would be consistent with lung fibrosis.  Sternal
 wires in situ.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
