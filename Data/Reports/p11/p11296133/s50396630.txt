                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded but clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary
 edema.  There is a prominent left pulmonary artery. A 2.4 cm lesion overlies
 the mid-to-lower thoracic vertebral bodies, likely a large osteophyte. The
 trachea is deviated slightly to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperexpansion without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 2.  Trachea deviation to the left, perhaps related to a large thyroid.
