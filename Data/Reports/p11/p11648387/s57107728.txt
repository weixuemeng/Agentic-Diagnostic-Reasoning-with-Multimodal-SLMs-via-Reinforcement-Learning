 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Two subtle,

 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The
 hilar contours are stable.  There are some degenerative changes along the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Nodular opacities again seen
 projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung and the lingula.
