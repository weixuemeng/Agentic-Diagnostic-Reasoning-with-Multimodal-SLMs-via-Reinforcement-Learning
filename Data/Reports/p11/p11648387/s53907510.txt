                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 bronchiectasis again noted at the lung bases and somewhat ovoid and tubular
 opacification in the right lung base compatible with previously noted nodules
 and mucoid impaction suggestive of infection.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild degenerative changes are seen
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of somewhat nodular and tubular opacities in the right lung
 base, previously thought on prior CT chest reflective of infection and mucoid
 impaction.
