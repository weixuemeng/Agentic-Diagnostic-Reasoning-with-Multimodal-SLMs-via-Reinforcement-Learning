                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Mid sternal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right
 cardiophrenic opacity is stable since ___ and may represent fat pad. 
 No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a 7 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right lower
 hemithorax which may represent nipple shadow, further evaluation with nipple
 markers.  An additional subcentimeter nodular opacity is seen just medial to
 the above.  Recommend non-urgent chest CT to assess for possible pulmonary
 nodule.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. 
 No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Sub-centimeter nodular opacities in the right lower hemithorax as
 above.  Recommend nonurgent chest CT to assess for possible underlying
 pulmonary nodule.
