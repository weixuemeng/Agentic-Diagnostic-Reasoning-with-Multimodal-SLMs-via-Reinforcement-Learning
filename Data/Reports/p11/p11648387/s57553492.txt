                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with failure to thrive  // eval  for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is compatible with a prominent fat
 pad.  Calcified granulomas in the right middle lobe seen on prior CT are
 faintly visualized.  There is some associated linear opacity at the right lung
 base as well, unchanged from prior potentially due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere,
 lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged right basilar opacity.  Potentially atelectasis noting that
 infection cannot be entirely excluded.
