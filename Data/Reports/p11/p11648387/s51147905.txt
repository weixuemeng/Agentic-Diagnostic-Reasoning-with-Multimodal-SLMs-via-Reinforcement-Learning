                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, with prominent epicardial fat overlying the right cardiophrenic
 angle, as seen on multiple prior exams.  The lungs are fairly well-aerated. 
 Streaky increased opacity in the right lung base likely represents
 atelectasis, but an early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky increased opacity in the right lung base likely represents
 atelectasis, but an early pneumonia cannot be excluded, and short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
