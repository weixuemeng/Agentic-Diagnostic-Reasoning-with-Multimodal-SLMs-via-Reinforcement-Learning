 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___
 CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lower lateral chest is excluded from the examination.  Other pleural
 surfaces are normal.
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated and clear of acute abnormality.  The
 constellation of bronchiectasis and infectious nodules in the right middle and
 lower lobes seen on chest CTA most recently ___ is no worse, but has not
 been reevaluated here by subsequent chest CT.  No pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are notable for mild degenerative changes of the
 mid thoracic spine with anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 Evaluation of bronchiectasis and prior inflammatory pulmonary nodules would
 require repeat chest CT.
