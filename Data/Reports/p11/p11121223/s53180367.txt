                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.  
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 Radiology technologist, the patient was unable to remain still for the
 exposure.  The cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Subtle
 right basilar opacity best seen on the frontal view could be due to
 atelectasis or due to mild vascular congestion.  Underlying consolidation is
 difficult to entirely exclude, but no definite consolidation is seen. 
 Surgical clips again are seen projecting over the right axilla.
