 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded and
 calcified but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Minimal linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
