                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions
 are identified.  There is no confluent consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 Calcifications of the aortic knob are again noted.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis
