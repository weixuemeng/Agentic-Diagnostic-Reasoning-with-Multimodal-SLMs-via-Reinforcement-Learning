                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of glioblastoma multiforme now with cough and pancytopenia,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right PICC line has been retracted with the tip now terminating in the
 proximal right axillary vein.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are increased
 bibasilar patchy airspace opacities in the bilateral lung bases concerning for
 developing pneumonia and raising the possibility of aspiration.  Small left
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged
 in size.  The mediastinum appears unchanged from the prior chest radiograph of
 ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC retracted with the tip terminating in the proximal right
 axillary vein. 
 
 2.  Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities new from the most recent prior study
 are concerning for developing pneumonia and raise the possibility of
 aspiration.
