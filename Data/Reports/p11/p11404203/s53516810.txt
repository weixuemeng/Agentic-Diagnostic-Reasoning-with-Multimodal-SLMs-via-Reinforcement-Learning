                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung volumes are
 low with crowding of bronchovasculature.  Given the prominence of reticular
 interstitial markings, mild edema is difficult to exclude.  The heart is top
 normal in size.  The mediastinum appears unchanged.  Mild hilar congestion is
 noted.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild interstitial edema.
