 Previous mild interstitial edema has resolved.  On the frontal film, there is
 a small region of irregular peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung,
 which could be a small pneumonia.  There is no appreciable atelectasis or
 pleural effusion.  Heart is mildly enlarged and the central pulmonary arteries
 are also enlarged, but both are unchanged over a long period of time, and
 there is no pulmonary edema, nor any evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement.  Mild loss of height in the thoracic vertebral bodies has
 advanced at one level over the course of a year.
