  No displaced rib fracture identified If concern is high for rib fracture,
  dedicated rib series or CT is more sensitive.
  
  Area of sclerosis involving the left proximal humerus is not well assessed.
  Correlate with history of malignancy. Findings may represent bone infarct,
  metastatic focus not excluded.  Suggest dedicated imaging of the left humerus.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p fall, rib bruising  // Eval for rib fx, PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced rib fracture is identified. Partially imaged area
 of sclerosis in the proximal left humerus may represent bone infarct or
 possibly enchondroma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture identified.  If
 concern is high for rib fracture, dedicated rib series or CT is more
 sensitive. Area of sclerosis involving the left proximal humerus is not well
 assessed. Correlate with history of malignancy. Findings may represent bone
 infarct, metastatic focus not excluded. Suggest dedicated imaging of the left
 humerus if not already evaluated.
