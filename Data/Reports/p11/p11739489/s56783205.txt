                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Intubated for seizures with new Dobbhoff placement.
 
 Two AP views of the chest  were reviewed.
 
 The first one demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube tip being at the level of the
 proximal esophagus and the second one demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube being at
 the level of the gastroesophageal junction that should be further advanced. 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Left retrocardiac consolidation is
 unchanged since the radiograph obtained earlier the same day.  Right
 subclavian line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  The ET tube tip is
 approximately 8 cm above the carina.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is most
 likely present.
