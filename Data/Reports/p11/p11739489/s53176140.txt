 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Volume overload, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously
 malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed.  The current nasogastric
 tube is in correct position.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild fluid overload
 persists, but there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  Mild areas of
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  No pleural effusions.
