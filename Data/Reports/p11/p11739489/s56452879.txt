                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:15 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with worsening ventilation.  History of
 pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 4:34 a.m.:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has nearly resolved from the right lung, still present on
 the left, over the past 18 hours.  Heart is mildly enlarged and mediastinal
 vessels mildly distended.  If there is consolidation anywhere in the lungs it
 is in the left lower lobe, but I cannot tell whether this is pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Similarly with the patient supine, the volume of left pleural
 effusion if any is difficult to assess, but there is at least some layering
 posteriorly.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC
 and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  ET tube in
 standard placement.
