                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of altered mental status, hypoxemia.  Please evaluate for
 COPD/ infiltrate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi upright radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is
 seen coursing to the lower hemithorax near the midline, with the tip out of
 view of this film. Mild cardiomegaly is overall stable compared to the prior
 exam.  Low lung volumes appears to exaggerate the perihilar vascular
 structures, however aside from mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, the
 hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Along the right heart border
 in the mid right lung, there is a focal opacity, which appears new compared to
 the prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Note is made of
 mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, with obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Focal opacity along the right heart border in the mid right lung, pneumonia
 vs aspiration vs atelectasis. 
 
 2. Interval worsening of mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right,
 with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, left retrocardiac consolidation
 not excluded.
