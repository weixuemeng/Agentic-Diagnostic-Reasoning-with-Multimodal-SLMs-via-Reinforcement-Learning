                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with lightheadedness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  On the lateral view, there
 is increased opacity projecting over the lower thoracic vertebral bodies which
 may localize to the right lung base on the frontal.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable compared to prior.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity best seen on the lateral view overlying the lower
 spine, potentially localizing to the right on the frontal view, could
 represent infection in the proper clinical setting.
