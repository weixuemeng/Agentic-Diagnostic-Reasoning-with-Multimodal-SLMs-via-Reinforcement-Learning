                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis s/p recent TIPS downsizing
 presenting with back pain radiating through chest, reproducible pain on exam. 
 // Evaluate for cardiac process vs. rib fracture vs. pulmonary process.    
 Evaluate for cardiac process vs. rib fracture vs. pulmonary
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Normal
 mediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
