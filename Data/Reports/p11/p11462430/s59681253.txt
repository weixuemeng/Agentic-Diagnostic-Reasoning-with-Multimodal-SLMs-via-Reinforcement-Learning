 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall 3 days ago complaining of pain, rule out fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous.  Subtle prominence noted at the AP window which may just be
 vascular however, underlying lymph node not excluded.  No displaced fracture
 is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Subtle prominence at the AP window
 nonspecific but underlying lymph nodes not excluded.  No prior is available
 for comparison to document long-term stability.  Findings can be further
 assessed on nonemergent chest CT.  Comparison with any priors may be helpful.
