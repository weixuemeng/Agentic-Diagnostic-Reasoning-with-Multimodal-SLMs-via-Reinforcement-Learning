                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 The chest is hyperinflated.  There is a new confluent posterior opacity in the
 left lower lobe with a bulging contour anteriorly.  This appearance is not
 entirely specific but is suggestive of a pleural effusion, potentially with
 loculation as a part of it.  However, other etiologies including confluent
 consolidation with pleural effusion or even potentially malignancy are not
 excluded by this examination.  A thick flowing anterior osteophyte is
 unchanged along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Pleural-based left lower lobe opacity with a bulging anterior contour. 
 Differential considerations include a pleural effusion with large loculated
 component, versus consolidation with a bulging contour and pleural effusion
 (which could be seen with some infections, for example, Klebsiella pneumonia),
 although even malignancy is not excluded.  Follow-up radiographs are
 recommended to show resolution versus consideration of chest CT if the likely
 etiology is not very clear at clinical grounds.
