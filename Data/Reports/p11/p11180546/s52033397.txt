                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with loculated left pleural
 effusion after thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The post-thoracocentesis radiograph demonstrates substantial decrease in the
 left pleural loculation.  Currently, the pigtail catheter is in place.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is still present left basal opacity,
 most likely reflecting area of atelectasis and residual pleural effusion. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are hyperinflated but
 essentially clear.
