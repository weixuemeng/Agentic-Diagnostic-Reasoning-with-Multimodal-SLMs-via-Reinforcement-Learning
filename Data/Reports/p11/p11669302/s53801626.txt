                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  This study was just presented for interpretation. Little change from
 the previous study. There may be mild decrease in opacification at the right
 base.

 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:53 AM
  Unchanged appearance of the chest from the prior study performed at 11:44.
  
  MAIN REPORT:  Indications: Wheezing.
  
  Comparisons: Earlier in the same day.
  
  Technique: Chest, portable AP upright.
  
  Findings: A right-sided PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes
  are low. The left base is somewhat better aerated but with persistent
  opacification, probably due to atelectasis, with a very small pleural
  effusion. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
  
  Impression: Improving aeration at the left lung base; otherwise unchanged.
