 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I do not clearly see any of the previously questioned lung nodules on today's
 examination.  The right nipple projects over the fourth anterior interspace. 
 However because of the nodular nature of the previous abnormalities, I would
 strongly for for another followup radiograph in 3 4 weeks with supplementary
 oblique views to make sure that we are not missing small lung nodules.  There
 is no consolidation, no pleural abnormality, no cardiac or hilar abnormality. 
 Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but not clearly dilated.
