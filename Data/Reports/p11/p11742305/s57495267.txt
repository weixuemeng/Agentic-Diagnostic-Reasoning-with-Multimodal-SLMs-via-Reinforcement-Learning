                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to ___ chest CT.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The lungs are essentially clear
 except for bilateral linear opacities most likely representing areas of
 scarring not clearly present on the remote prior chest CT.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
