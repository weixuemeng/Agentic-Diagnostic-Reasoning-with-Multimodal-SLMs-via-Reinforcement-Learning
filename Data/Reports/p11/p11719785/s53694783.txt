                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a vague patchy opacity in the right lower lung which
 has increased since prior studies, particularly in the right costophrenic
 angle.  The possibility of an infectious process could be considered
 clinically.  A nodular focus projecting over the left lower chest is
 consistent with an unchanged nipple shadow, visible before.  Mild degenerative
 changes are present along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity, probably in the right lower lobe
 for which clinical correlation is suggested.  Early pneumonia would be a
 differential consideration, although atelectasis, scarring or airway
 inflammation could be considered.
