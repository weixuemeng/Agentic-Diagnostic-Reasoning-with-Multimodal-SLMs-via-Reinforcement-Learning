                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diabetes and generalized weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation and accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no focal airspace consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  Post-surgical
 changes from a prior CABG are unchanged.  Sternal wires are intact.  A small
 rounded opacity behind the heart is stable and may represent a small hiatal
 hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
