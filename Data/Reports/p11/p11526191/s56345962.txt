                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a small heterogeneous
 opacity in the left lower lobe and there is slight blunting of the posterior
 left costophrenic angle.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity and mild blunting of the posterior left costophrenic
 angle may represent atelectasis but pneumonia is also in the differential in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
