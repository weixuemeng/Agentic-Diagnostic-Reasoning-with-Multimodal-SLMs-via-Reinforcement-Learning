                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever and crackles.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Right lower lobe opacities have increased from ___.  This could be due to
 increasing atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
