                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, weakness and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are remarkable.  There is a patchy posterior basilar opacity, likely within
 the right lower lobe.  It is difficult to exclude a trace pleural effusion on
 the left noting posterior blunting along the costophrenic sulcus.  Slight
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right lower lobe opacification, probably compatible with
 atelectasis noting elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, although pneumonia is
 hard to entirely exclude.
