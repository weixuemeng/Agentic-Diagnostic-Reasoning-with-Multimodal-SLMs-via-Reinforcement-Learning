                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS biopsy of hilar mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, no definite pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  The right juxtahilar mass is again seen, though the peripheral
 areas of opacification are slightly less prominent.  Left lung is essentially
 within normal limits, and no definite pleural effusion is appreciated.
