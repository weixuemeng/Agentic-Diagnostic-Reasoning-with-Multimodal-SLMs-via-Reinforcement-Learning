 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, a very small right
 apical pneumothorax is noted and appears slightly smaller than on the prior

 Nonspecific opacities in right upper lobe also appear relatively similar. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are apparently new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Very small right apical pneumothorax following removal of right-sided
 chest tube.
 
 2.  Large right juxtahilar mass in keeping with malignancy.
 
 3.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
