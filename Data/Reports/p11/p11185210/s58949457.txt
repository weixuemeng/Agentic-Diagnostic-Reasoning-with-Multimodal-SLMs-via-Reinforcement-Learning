 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is a mildly displaced
 fracture of the posterior lateral left seventh rib which may be acute.  A
 fracture of the lateral left eighth rib demonstrates callus formation and is
 subacute to old, but new since chest radiograph from ___.  The
 partially imaged left humeral head is high riding, suggesting rotator cuff
 disease.  There is left glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint degenerative
 change.
