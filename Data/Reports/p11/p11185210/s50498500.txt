 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sudden onset of weakness, rule out lung mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are large.  There is no evidence of overinflation.
 Bilateral apical thickening, right more than left, is seen at both lung
 apices.  There are areas of mild pulmonary scarring at the bases of the left
 and right lung base.  No acute changes such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable, the hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  However, if more subtle opacities are suspected, CT
 should be performed.
