                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, subtle lateral left base opacity is seen which may be due to
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No focal
 consolidation is seen on the right.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  An ovoid radiopaque structure is seen overlying the epigastric
 region, to the left of midline, not seen on the lateral view, and may be
 external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Subtle
 lateral left base opacity may be due to atelectasis although a focal
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
