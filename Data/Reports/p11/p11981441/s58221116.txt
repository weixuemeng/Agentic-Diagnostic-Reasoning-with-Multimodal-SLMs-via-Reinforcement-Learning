                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new bradycardia  // ? effusion, consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacer device is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.There is slight blunting of
 the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be due to hyperinflation
 pleural thickening versus trace pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be related
 to hyperinflation, pleural thickening, versus trace pleural effusions.
 
 Otherwise, no focal consolidation.
