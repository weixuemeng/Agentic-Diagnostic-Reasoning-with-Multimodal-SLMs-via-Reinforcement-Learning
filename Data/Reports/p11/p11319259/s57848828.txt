                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough and wheeze.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly decreased lung
 volumes with prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Even allowing for this, the cardiac silhouette is likely top normal
 to mildly enlarged in size. A retrocardiac opacity likely represents
 pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity, which likely represents pneumonia.
