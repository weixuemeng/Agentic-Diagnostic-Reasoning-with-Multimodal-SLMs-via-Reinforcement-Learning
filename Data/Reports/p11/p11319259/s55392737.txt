                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, there is an
 apparent diffuse bilateral interstitial pattern within the lungs.  However,
 considering the absence of interstitial disease on recent CT of ___, it is likely that this perceived interstitial pattern is due to crowding
 of normal bronchovascular structures.  Minor atelectasis is present at the
 lung bases, but there are no focal areas of consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes.  Apparent bilateral interstitial
 pattern may simply reflect crowding of normal bronchovascular structures given
 the absence of interstitial lung disease on ___ chest CTA. 
 However, if clinical suspicion for acute interstitial process persists, repeat
 chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level would be recommended for more
 complete assessment.
