                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of asthma, now with productive
 cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low with increased density at the lung bases, left greater
 than right, which could represent atelectasis, but infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  Mild interstitial prominence is noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Curvilinear density projecting over the left lung
 field does not follow an anatomic course and therefore is most likely external
 to the patient.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes without lateral view, limiting evaluation of the lung
 bases.  Increased density at bilateral lung bases may represent atelectasis,
 but is worse on the left and focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Mild interstitial prominence, which could be secondary to small airways
 disease, viral infection, or mild edema.
