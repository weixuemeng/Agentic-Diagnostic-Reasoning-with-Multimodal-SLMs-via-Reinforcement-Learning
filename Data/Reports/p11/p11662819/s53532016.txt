                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with asthma.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Subtle bronchial cuffing is present, compatible with
 inflammatory change.  Bibasilar opacities are seen which may be due to
 atelectasis, but underlying infection is not excluded. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
