                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemodialysis and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to study of ___, there is little interval change. 
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary
 vascular congestion and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
