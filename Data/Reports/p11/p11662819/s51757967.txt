  Extensive  parenchymal opacities are mostly stable.  These findings could be
  due to eosinophilic lung disease as well as pulmonary edema.  Consolidation in
  the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region is slightly increasing, likely
  due to atelectasis.  An associated effusion or superimposed infection is
  difficult to exclude.

 HISTORY:  E eosinophilic lung disease with dyspnea and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
