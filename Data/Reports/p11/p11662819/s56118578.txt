                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ as well as a CT of the
 chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, shortness of breath, assess infection
 versus CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a
 similar overall pattern of vague ground-glass opacities within both lungs
 which has been previously ascribed to pulmonary edema and again the
 possibility of pulmonary edema is raised.  However, in the correct clinical
 context, the possibility of an atypical infection is also raised.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged but stable.  There is a small left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.  Bony structure is intact.  Metallic coils in the upper
 abdomen noted. A sclerotic appearance of the spine is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague ground-glass opacity within the lungs likely reflect
 pulmonary edema, cannot entirely exclude an atypical pneumonia.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and small left effusion also noted.
