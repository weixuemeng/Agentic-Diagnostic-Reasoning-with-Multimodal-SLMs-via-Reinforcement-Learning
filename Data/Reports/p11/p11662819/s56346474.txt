                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for 3 weeks, dehydrated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Additionally, the hila are enlarged
 bilaterally, compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension, as seen on the
 prior CT.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are embolization coils as well as multiple surgical clips
 noted in the imaged upper abdomen.  Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous
 structures is compatible with patient's history of renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
