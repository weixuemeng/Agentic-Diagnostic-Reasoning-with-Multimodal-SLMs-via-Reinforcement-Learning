                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Psychosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and torso CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy, CABG, mitral valve surgery, and right upper lobectomy. Volume loss
 in the right lung is again noted with scarring again seen in the right lung
 base. Ill-defined opacity projecting over the right hilum appears similar to
 the prior study, likely reflecting a combination of postoperative changes from
 prior upper lobe resection and residua of the previously seen air and fluid
 collection in the retrosternal space. Though, no air is identified within the
 retrosternal space on the current lateral view.   The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study except that
 the previously noted gas seen within a retrosternal fluid collection appears
 to have resolved.
