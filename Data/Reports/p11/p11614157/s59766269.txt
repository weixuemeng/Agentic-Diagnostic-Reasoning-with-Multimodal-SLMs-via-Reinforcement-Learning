                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post MVC, increased oxygen
 demands, on bed rest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 very recumbent position.  Comparison is made with the portable supine chest
 examination ___ ___ performed in the department's emergency unit.  The
 heart size remains unchanged.  The appearance of the thoracic aorta is
 unremarkable.  Again high positioned diaphragms indicative of poor inspiratory
 effort during examination.  Crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature
 present.  In addition, one has the impression of a plethora of the pulmonary
 vessels without evidence of perivascular haze or pleural effusion.  This may
 be the result of patient's bed rest and post-trauma fluid treatment.  Local
 discrete parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified on this portable chest
 examination.  If possible have repeat exam with standard views in PA and
 lateral projection with patient in upright position. This would be optimal to
 evaluate for possible pneumonic infiltrates.  No pneumothorax is seen on this
 portable examination.
