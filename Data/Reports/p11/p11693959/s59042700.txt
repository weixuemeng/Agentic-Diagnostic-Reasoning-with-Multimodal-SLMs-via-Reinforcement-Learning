 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p multiple renal transplants on
 immunosuppresion, here with hypoxemic respiratory failure thought ___
 multifocal pneumonia as well as bilateral effusions  // ? interval change    ?
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema, and pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement have
 improved substantially since ___, although heart remains moderately
 enlarged. This clearing of the lungs reveals a large, masslike consolidation
 in the right lower lobe and possibly smaller lesions elsewhere in the lower
 lungs.  When feasible, conventional radiographs should be obtained.  Findings
 suggest considerable pulmonary infection, but it is important to exclude an
 unexpected progressive malignancy with careful radiographic evaluation.
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.
