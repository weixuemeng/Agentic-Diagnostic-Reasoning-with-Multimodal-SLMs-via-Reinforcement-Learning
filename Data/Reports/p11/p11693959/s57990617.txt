                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia  // interval change of RUL
 opacity?      interval change of RUL opacity?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the large, masslike consolidation in the right lower lobe with probable patchy
 areas of opacification at the left base as well.  This is again consistent
 with multifocal pneumonia, as seen on the recent CT scan.  There has been
 placement of a left IJ catheter that extends well into the right atrium.
