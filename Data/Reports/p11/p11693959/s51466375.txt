                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated at outside hospital. Evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is
 present in courses into the stomach.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged. Bilateral interstitial opacities are compatible
 with moderate pulmonary edema.  There are small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, the latter resulting in air
 bronchograms.  Superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube 3.2 cm above the carina.
 2. Moderate pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions. Superimposed infection be difficult to exclude.
