                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical ventilation, new fever.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 12:26 p.m.
 
 Compared with differences in positioning, the overall appearance of the chest
 and lungs is similar, with upper zone redistribution, interstitial edema and
 probable patchy alveolar edema, all consistent with CHF; and with small
 bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 effusions may be slightly smaller.  Some more focal opacity along the upper
 right chest wall is seen on today's exam, though this may be accentuated by
 differences in positioning and by overlying tubing.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying fundus.  Right subclavian central
 line tip overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected, though the
 extreme upper right lung apex is excluded from the film.  Tubing is also noted
 over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Minimal change compared with ___.  Again seen is CHF with bilateral
 effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The effusions may be
 slightly smaller.  
 
 2) Question focal opacity along the right chest wall, more pronounced on this
 exam, though there is considerable overlying artifact and differences in
 patient rotation.
