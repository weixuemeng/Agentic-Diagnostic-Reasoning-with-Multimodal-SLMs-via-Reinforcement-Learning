                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of 1 day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional difference of
 the patient.  Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion persists,
 accompanied by worsening asymmetrical perihilar opacification, possibly due to
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Other process such as aspiration or developing
 pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis and small-to-moderate pleural effusions appear slightly larger
 than the prior study, but positional differences may contribute to this
 apparent change.
