  1.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum for which further evaluation with a
  chest CT with contrast is recommended.  2.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.  3. 
  The enteric tube could be advanced 8 cm for positioning of the side port
  within the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress with possible pneumonia in an intubated. 
 Evaluate for tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph at 4:22 today.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH (2 EXPOSURES):  An endotracheal tube is in
 satisfactory position, 4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube courses along
 the esophagus and terminates just distal to the gastroesophageal junction. 
 The gastric side port is located within the esophagus.
 
 There is a large consolidation of the right upper lobe, consistent with
 pneumonia.  Additionally, there is volume loss of the right lower lobe with
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There are probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is apparent widening of
 the mediastinum.  Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Widening of the mediastinum for which further evaluation with a chest CT
 with contrast or comparison to prior studies is recommended.  
 2.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.  
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 4.  The enteric tube could be advanced 8 cm for positioning of the side port
 within the stomach.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:28 on ___ via telephone at the time of discovery.
