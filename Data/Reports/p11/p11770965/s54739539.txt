                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:38 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral chest tubes, clamp trial.  Now back
 on suction on the left, right still clamped.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is definitely a moderate left pneumothorax, despite the basal pleural
 tube.  There may be a small-to-moderate right pneumothorax, both
 underestimated because the patient is insufficiently erect to delineate the
 pleural air.  I would recommend a fully erect chest radiograph if feasible.
 
 Symmetric moderately severe opacification in both lower lungs is most readily
 explained by edema, unchanged over several days.  Heart size is normal. 
 Pleural effusion is small, if any.
 
 ET tube, left subclavian and right internal jugular central venous lines, and
 an upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.  Right pleural
 drain has been removed.
 
 I discussed these findings by telephone with the NP covering this patient.
