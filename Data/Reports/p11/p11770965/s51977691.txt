                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post re-do AVR, MVR, CABG, nausea, followup edema and
 Dobbhoff placement.
 
 CHEST, CENTERED LOW, SINGLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lung apices are excluded from the film.
 
 A nasogastric-type tube is present. It appears different from the Dobbhoff
 tube seen on ___ and presumably was placed on ___.  The tube appears
 to be coiled in the stomach.  The radiopaque tip does not appear to pass
 beyond the pylorus.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.   
 
 A right IJ dual-lumen catheter overlies the distal SVC.  A left subclavian
 central line lies at the SVC/RA junction.  There are moderately dense
 bilateral diffuse patchy alveolar opacities.  These alveolar opacitieis are
 nonspecific, but compatible with alveolar edema.  There is also a small left
 effusion and some underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 Sternotomy wires, AVR and MVR and skin ___ noted. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette stable.
 
 Compared with ___, the appearance is grossly similar, with some more fluid
 at the left base and possible slight clearing in the right mid zone.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Orogastric-type tube tip appears to lie within the distal stomach and does
 not appear to extend beyond the pylorus.
 
 2.  Dense alveolar opacities with left effusion and left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation grossly similar to prior, slightly worse at the left base
 and possibly slightly improved in the right mid zone.
