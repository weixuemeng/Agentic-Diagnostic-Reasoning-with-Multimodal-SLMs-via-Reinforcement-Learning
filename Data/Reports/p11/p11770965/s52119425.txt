                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary edema.  History of OG tube placement. 
 Please evaluate location of an OG tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of lower chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter
 which appears to terminate in the main pulmonary artery.  There are bilateral
 chest tubes which appear to be in appropriate position.  The OG tube appears
 to terminate in the body of the stomach.  There is a stable small right
 pleural effusion.  There is stable opacification of the bilateral lung bases
 likely secondary to pulmonary edema and adjacent mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 The upper lung zones are not visualized on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 OG tube appears to extend below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the body
 of the stomach.
