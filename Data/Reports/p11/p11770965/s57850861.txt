                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known left apical pneumothorax in the setting of aortic valve
 replacement, mitral valve replacement, and CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Small left apical pneumothorax is
 stable.  Again noted are median sternotomy wires, surgical ___, left-sided
 chest tube, double-lumen right IJ catheter, and left subclavian central venous
 catheter.  Diffuse parenchymal opacities that likely reflect pulmonary edema
 are unchanged from ___.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 slightly enlarged, but this may be due to lower lung volumes.
