                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post AVR.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays, most recently from ___ and
 CT chest without contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior study, multifocal pneumonia of
 the right lung is clearing with residual opacities present in the right upper
 lobe and right middle lobe.  Again seen are calcified pleural plaques and
 peripheral interstitial opacities compatible with history of asbestosis. 
 Pulmonary edema has improved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly
 enlarged as seen previously.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving multifocal pneumonia in the right lung. Please note that it is
 important to document radiographic clearance of the residual right upper lobe
 opacity especially as there is overlap in imaging features of the pneumonic
 form of adenocarcinoma and an infectious pneumonia.
 2.  Resolution of pulmonary edema.
 3.  Calcified pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure and
 peripheral interstitial fibrosis suggestive of asbestosis.
