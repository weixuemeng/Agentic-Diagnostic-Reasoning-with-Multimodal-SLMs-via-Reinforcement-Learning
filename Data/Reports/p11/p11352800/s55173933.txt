                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aortic stenosis, status post AVR and
 Maze for Afib.  History of asbestos exposure and smoking; presents with
 dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss.  Evaluate for CHF versus infection versus
 malignancy.
 
 Comparison is made to a reference chest study from ___ dated
 ___, selected images from a chest CT dated ___ as well as a
 previous PA and lateral chest film from ___ dated ___.
 
 Two views of the chest ___ at 10:21 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  There is diffuse bilateral interstitial and
 pleural-based abnormality with associated pleural calcifications and
 diaphragmatic calcifications.  These findings are consistent with asbestosis. 
 More focal peripheral areas of nodularity are also seen.  Overall, since ___, there has been significant worsening of the interstitial lung disease
 particularly in the upper lungs.  Although these findings could reflect
 worsening asbestosis, other etiologies of interstitial lung disease with
 fibrosis as well as superimposed infection should be considered.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Given the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy on
 the recent chest CT of ___, malignancy should also be considered and if
 this were the case then the findings in lung could represent lymphangitic
 spread of tumor.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles likely reflects small
 layering effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Radiopaque opacities projecting over
 the stomach likely reflect ingested pills.
