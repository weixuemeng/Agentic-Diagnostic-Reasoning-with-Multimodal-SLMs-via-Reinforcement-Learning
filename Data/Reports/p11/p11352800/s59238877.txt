                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post atrial valve repair and chest tube removal. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, ___, CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Swan-Ganz
 catheter has been removed.  There is interval removal of the NG, ET and chest
 tubes.  Multiple overlying structures in the right apex limit evaluation. 
 Sternotomy wires appear intact. Right costophrenic angle is obscured,
 suggestive of small pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion. 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Perihilar vascular congestion is
 present.  Bilateral opacities with relative sparing of the upper lung zones
 persist.  Pleural plaques and subpleural reticular opacities are better
 appreciated on prior CT.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over confluence of
 right IJ and subclavian vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of Swan-Ganz, ET, NG and chest tube.  Multiple overlying
 structures in the right lung apex limit evaluation for small apical
 pneumothorax.  No appreciable pneumothorax.  
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Persistent bilateral airspace opacities.  Small right
 pleural effusion.
