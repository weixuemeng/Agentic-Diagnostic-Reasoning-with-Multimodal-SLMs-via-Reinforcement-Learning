                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric outlet obstruction with probable aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube has been advanced to approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends to the upper stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image.
 
 Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Increased opacification at the left base
 appears to be more extensive than mere vascular crowding, suggesting
 developing consolidation (especially in view of the clinical history).  Some
 atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
