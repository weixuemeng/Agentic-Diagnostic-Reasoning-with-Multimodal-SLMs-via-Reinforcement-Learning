                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric outlet obstruction with possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a generalized
 indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  More focal areas of opacification are seen at the
 right base and in the retrocardiac region.  Although these could reflect
 merely atelectasis, the possibility of consolidation related to aspiration
 must be seriously considered.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip remains approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.
