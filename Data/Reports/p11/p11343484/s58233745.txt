  Heterogeneous opacities within the mid to lower aspects of both lungs could be
  chronic in nature or may be an acute infectious process versus aspiration
  pneumonitis; comparison to any available prior outside hospital imaging would
  be helpful.  Bilateral pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques. 
  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 20:32 via telephone on
  the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Lateral pleural thickening with
 calcifications.  These project over the lung parenchyma and create the
 appearance of nodular changes.  Moreover, they limit the assessment of the
 radiographic appearance of the lung parenchyma in both lower lung parts. 
 Presence of a subtle parenchymal abnormality, therefore, cannot be determined.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
