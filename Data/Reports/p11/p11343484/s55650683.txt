                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypertension and a right basal ganglia
 intraparenchymal hemorrhage who presents for evaluation of free air given
 abdominal distention.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, 5:19 a.m.  ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  There is a
 right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the mid SVC.  The enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip beyond the scope of the film. 
 Again, multiple calcified pleural plaques overlie the lungs with unchanged
 pleural thickening. There has been interval improvement of the left
 retrocardiac opacity compared to the exam performed earlier this morning,
 consistent with improving atelectasis. Non-specific opacity at the right lung
 base is unchanged.  No new focal consolidations are seen.  The small bilateral
 pleural effusions are stable.  There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly
 is longstanding. The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.
 There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 2. Interval improvement of left basilar atelectasis. No new focal opacities
 identified.
 
 3. Evidence of previous asbestos exposure.
