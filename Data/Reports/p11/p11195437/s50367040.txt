                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Bilateral brain stimulator,
 generators and leads are seen, slightly rotated in positioning when compared
 to prior.  Where seen, the lungs remain clear.  The previously seen
 retrocardiac opacity is again seen only on the frontal view and on the lateral
 is likely obscured by degenerative changes in the spine.  There is no effusion
 or pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Persistent retrocardiac nodule
 for which dedicated non-urgent chest CT is again suggested.
