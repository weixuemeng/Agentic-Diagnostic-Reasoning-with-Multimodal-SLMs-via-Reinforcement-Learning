                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural biopsy
 and thoracocentesis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___, chest CT from ___, and CT torso from ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax, but there is a
 small-to-moderate amount of pericardial effusion that appears to be not
 essentially unchanged from the pre-biopsy assessment.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips projecting over the left hemithorax are
 consistent with prior breast surgery.
