 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Resolving gallstone, pancreatitis and fever, questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation at the lung bases, likely reflecting a stronger inspiratory
 effort.  Currently, there is no evidence of pneumonia.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.
