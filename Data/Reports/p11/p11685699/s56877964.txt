                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and more recent CT of the abdomen from the prior
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, as seen on the
 recent CT, with associated parenchymal opacity, most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  The pleural effusion is similar to the recent prior CT but
 possibly decreased somewhat since the prior radiographs, although a possible
 difference in patient orientation is a confounding factor regarding the
 comparison.  The left lung remains clear.  A PICC line terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right-sided pleural effusion, possibly decreased. 
 PICC line terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Although pneumonia cannot
 be excluded, findings on the CT from the prior day were suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Superimposed infection is difficult to exclude, however.
