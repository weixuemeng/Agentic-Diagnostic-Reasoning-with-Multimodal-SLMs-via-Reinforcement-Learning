 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A lower lobe opacity is visualized consistent with patient's
 moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are without any other focal consolidations, or pneumothorax.  Right PICC
 line is visualized with the tip in the right axilla.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There appears tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Known right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis with no focal
 consolidations otherwise identified.
 2.  Right PICC line tip in right axilla.  Re-positioning is recommended.
