                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest painHX. Pleural effusion  // chest
 painPleural effusion      chest painPleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion or pleural scarring is chronic.  27 mm wide round
 opacity projecting over the right lung base laterally could be a lung nodule
 or rounded atelectasis.  CT scanning, with intravenous contrast, would be
 helpful in making the differentiation.  Also at the right lung base is the
 suggestion of a large thin-walled ring shadow in the right lower lobe,
 probably a bulla or pneumatocele, unlikely to be related to chest pain.
 
 Heart is top-normal size.  Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous. 
 There is no left pleural abnormality.  Left lung grossly clear.
 
 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to evaluate possible right lung nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by email on
 ___ at 3:57 PM,  minutes after discovery of the findings.
