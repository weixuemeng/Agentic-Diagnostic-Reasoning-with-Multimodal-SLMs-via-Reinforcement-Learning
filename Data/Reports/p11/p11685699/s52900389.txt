                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis, question Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC is in place with tip in upper SVC in unchanged
 position.  Visualization of the Dobbhoff tube is difficult due to limited beam
 penetration, however, the tube is visualized to course below the diaphragm
 with tip terminating in the expected location of the gastric body.  Lung
 volumes are decreased in comparison with the previous examination with
 increase in bibasilar atelectasis.  A small right-sided pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous structures unchanged.  Trace left
 pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube has been advanced and is now located in the expected region
 of the gastric body.  PICC in unchanged position.
 2.  Stable right pleural effusion.  Slight increase in bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Trace left pleural effusion unchanged.
