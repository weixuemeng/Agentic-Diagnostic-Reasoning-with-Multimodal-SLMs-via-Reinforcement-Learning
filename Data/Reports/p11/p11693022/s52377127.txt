                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with active SCLC, history of DVT, unable to
 anticoagulate, with chest pain, tachycardia, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  Hilar contours are unremarkable and the known left lesion seen on
 prior CT is not well seen on the current exam.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Continued streaky and patchy opacity within the left lung base
 likely reflects mild postobstructive atelectatic changes, not substantially
 changed in the interval.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Emphysematous changes are again noted within the lung apices.  There is
 minimal atelectasis in the right lung base.  Degenerative changes are noted
 within the imaged thoracic spine.  Amorphous calcification adjacent to the
 lateral aspect of the right humeral head may reflect calcific tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known left hilar lesion seen on prior CT is not well visualized on the current
 radiograph.  Continued postobstructive atelectatic changes in the left lung
 base, not substantially changed in the interval.
