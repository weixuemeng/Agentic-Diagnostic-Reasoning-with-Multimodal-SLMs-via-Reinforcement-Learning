                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sudden onset dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the study obtained approximately 3 hr earlier, the retrocardiac
 patchy opacity appears worse, likely reflective of worsening atelectasis. 
 Mild atelectasis in the right lung base is unchanged.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 remain unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip remains in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval worsening of left basilar opacity likely reflective of
 worsening atelectasis.  Coexistent infection is not excluded.
