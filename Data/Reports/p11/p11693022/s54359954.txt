                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, on chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and known left hilar lesion
 is not well assessed on the current exam.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy ill-defined retrocardiac opacity persists.  Minimal
 atelectasis is seen in the right lung base.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are moderate degenerative changes
 identified within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent patchy retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect continued
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
