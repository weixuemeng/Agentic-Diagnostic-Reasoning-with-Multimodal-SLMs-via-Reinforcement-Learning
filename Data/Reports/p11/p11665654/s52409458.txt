                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis and low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is poor inspiratory effort
 and low lung volumes.  Linear opacities within the bilateral lung bases likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation is identified. 
 There is no interstitial edema or pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is likely
 exaggerated due to the AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable subsegmental atelectasis.
 Atelectasis can be a feature of acute pulmonary embolism and should be
 considered clinically.
