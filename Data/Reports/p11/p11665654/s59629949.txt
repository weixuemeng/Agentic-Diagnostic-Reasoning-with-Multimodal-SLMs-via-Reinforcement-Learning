                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mildly increased radiodensity projects over the right lower lung. 
 The remainder of the lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Radiodensity projecting over the right lower lung likely
 represents overlying soft tissue; however, if this conforms to a clinical
 suspicion of pneumonia, then routine oblique radiographs of the chest may be
 obtained for confirmation.
