 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:21 PM
  Lung volumes are low, resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
  bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is likely mild
  vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities, left greater
  than right, likely reflect atelectasis. There may be a trace left pleural
  effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right colectomy with SOB  // please eval for
 chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, contributing to vascular crowding.  Despite that, there
 is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Sternotomy wires are intact and
 aligned. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. Small left
 pleural effusion has slightly increased. Increased retrocardiac airspace
 opacification may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due to atelectasis or
 aspiration.
 Slightly increased small left pleural effusion.
