                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after laparoscopic
 esophagectomy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is at the level of the carina, most likely within the
 neoesophagus.  Right chest tube is in place.  There is small amount of right
 apical pneumothorax and substantial amount of right subcutaneous air.  Heart
 size is difficult to assess in the presence of neoesophagus.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects atelectasis.
