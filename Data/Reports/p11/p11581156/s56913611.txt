                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through accounting
 for the widened right mediastinal contour. Heart size is difficult to assess
 but likely remains at least mildly enlarged. A moderate sized pleural effusion
 has increased in size compared to the previous chest radiograph. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Left basilar opacification likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis but infection is not excluded. New focal patchy
 opacity is demonstrated within the medial left upper lobe. No pneumothorax is
 present. There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of left pleural effusion, now moderate in size. Left basilar
 opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.  New focal patchy opacity in the medial aspect of the left upper
 lobe is concerning for infection.
