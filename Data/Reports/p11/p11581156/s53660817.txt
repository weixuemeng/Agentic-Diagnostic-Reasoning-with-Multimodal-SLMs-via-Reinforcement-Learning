                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy. 
 Rule out pneumothorax post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 study, there has been interval removal of a right pleural tube.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The neoesophagus is seen projecting over the right
 hemithorax with an air-fluid level.  There is no evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.  Residual barium is seen
 within the neoesophagus and also in bowel below the level of the diaphragm. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval removal of right pleural tube with no residual
 pneumothorax.  Stable post-operative changes.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
