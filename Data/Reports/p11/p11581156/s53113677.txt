                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 939 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right chest tube and episodes of severe
 agitation.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:55 a.m.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 939 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right chest tube and left paramediastinal drains are unchanged.  Some
 interval increase in distention of the region of the neoesophagus with less
 air and more soft tissue opacity in this region on the current study.  A very
 tiny right apical pneumothorax is present but unchanged.  The heart remains
 unchanged in size.  The left lung is essentially clear with the exception of
 linear opacity at the left costophrenic angle which likely reflects scarring
 or subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Interval
 improvement in aeration at the right base suggesting resolving atelectasis. 
 Residual but improving right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
