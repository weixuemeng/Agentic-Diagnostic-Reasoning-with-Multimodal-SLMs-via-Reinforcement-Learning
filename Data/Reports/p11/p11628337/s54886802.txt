                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, weakness, chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Scarring within the lung apices is stable.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 More focal linear opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 scarring or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Diffuse demineralization the osseous structures is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis versus scarring.
