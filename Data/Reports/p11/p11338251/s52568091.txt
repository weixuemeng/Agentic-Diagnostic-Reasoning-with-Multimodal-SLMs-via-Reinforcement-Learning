 surfaces are clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour and hila are normal.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable without
 free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically, no evidence of
 pneumonia.
