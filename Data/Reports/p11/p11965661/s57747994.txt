                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Interval increase in caliber of
 pulmonary vessels accompanied by peribronchial cuffing and asymmetrically
 distributed perihilar haziness, left greater than right.  Observed findings
 could be due to fluid overload or potentially a developing airway-centric
 infection.  Lungs remain hyperinflated in keeping with known emphysema, and
 nonspecific opacities at the lung bases are unchanged on the left and slightly
 improved on the right.  Right costophrenic sulcus blunting could reflect
 pleural thickening or small effusion.  No visible pneumothorax.
