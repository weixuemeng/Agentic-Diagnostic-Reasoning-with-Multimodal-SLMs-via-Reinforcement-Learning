                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent respiratory failure.  //
 pulmonary edema, pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has severe emphysema much more extensive and confluent consolidation
 has developed in the right lower lung, and more heterogeneous opacification
 has developed in the left over the past 4 days.  Although this could be
 asymmetric edema, I would favor extensive pneumonia and perhaps only a
 component of edema since mediastinal veins are not dilated.  On the other hand
 the left hilus, perhaps the heart, and left upper lobe vessel are larger.
 
 Small right pleural effusion has increased.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, feeding tube loops in the stomach and passes
 out of view, and the right PIC line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 12:40 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
