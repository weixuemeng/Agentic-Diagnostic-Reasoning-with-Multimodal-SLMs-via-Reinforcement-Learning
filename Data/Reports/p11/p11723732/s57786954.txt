                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent E. coli sepsis.  Now with delirium and
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, pulmonary edema has cleared.  Heart size is still
 moderately large, but without interval change.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, the residual of the since resolved edema, have developed, and in
 conjunction with dependent atelectasis are sufficient to explain opacification
 at both lung bases.
