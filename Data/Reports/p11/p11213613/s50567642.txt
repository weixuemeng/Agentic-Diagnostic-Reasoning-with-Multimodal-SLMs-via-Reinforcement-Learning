                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___, ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  Left lower lobe opacity
 has improved, consistent with improving pneumonia.  Right lower lobe opacity
 has increased, likely due to increasing atelectasis including a more focal
 elongated dense small opacity in the right lower lobe medially that has
 worsened.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Wedge-shaped
 deformity in a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving pneumonia in the left lower lobe.  Worsening opacity in
 the right lower lobe which could be due to increasing atelectasis, but
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded and followup is recommended.
