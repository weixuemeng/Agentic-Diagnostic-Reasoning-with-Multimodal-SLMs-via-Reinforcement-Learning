                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT abdomen of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal when allowances are made for prominent
 bilateral pericardial fat pads, shown to better detail on CT abdomen of
 ___.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 without change.  Lungs are remarkable for upper lobe predominant emphysema,
 more severe in the right upper lobe than the left.  No new focal lung
 abnormalities were detected, and there are no pleural effusions.  Mild
 compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with upper lobe
 predominant emphysema.  No evidence of pneumonia.  If symptoms persist,
 consider a chest CT for more complete evaluation if warranted clinically.
