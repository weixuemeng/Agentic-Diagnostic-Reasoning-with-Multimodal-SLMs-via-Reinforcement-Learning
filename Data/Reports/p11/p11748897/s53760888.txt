                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 Diffuse haziness over the right lower lung field is unchanged, and compatible
 with the patient's history of a partial breast implant.  There is no evidence
 of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
