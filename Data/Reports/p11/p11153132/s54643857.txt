 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening SOB  // eval for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion O was more pronounced on ___.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is chronic. There is no mediastinal venous engorgement.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are stable on the right, increased on the left.  A
 wedge-shaped area of consolidation in the right lower lung is probably
 unchanged.  I am not sure where this is but it is probably chronic atelectasis
 in the right lower lobe.  Remainder of the lungs essentially clear. No
 pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends in the upper to mid SVC.
