                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New A-fib. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is mild biapical
 pleural thickening.  There is mild prominence of the interstitium diffusely
 which could in part relate to COPD; however, raises concern for interstitial
 edema.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and quite tortuous. 
 Right midhemithorax opacity may relate to mediastinal/vascular structures;
 however, an underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is
 diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and calcified and tortuous aorta.  Medial
 right midhemithorax opacity may relate to overlapping prominent vascular
 structures; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 2.  Interstitial pulmonary edema.
 3.  COPD.
