                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall, bruising and swelling on both
 knees  // Fractures or dislocations in knees
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles bilaterally could suggest chronic pleural
 thickening or trace pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may suggest trace pleural
 effusions or chronic pleural thickening.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
