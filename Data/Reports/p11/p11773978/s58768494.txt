                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  An
 asymmetrical focal opacity is identified at the level of the right first
 costochondral junction, and is probably related to asymmetrical degenerative
 changes at this level.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity at level of right costochondral junction, likely
 due to asymmetrical degenerative changes at this level, but an apical lordotic
 chest radiograph is recommended to exclude the possibility of a lung nodule,
 as communicated by phone to Dr. ___ at 7:55 a.m. on ___ at the
 time of discovery.
