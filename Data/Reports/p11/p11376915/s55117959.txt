                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  New ET tube terminates 2.1 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 remains in the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  Opacities in the right lung
 likely reflect known pulmonary contusions.  The heart is slightly larger than
 on the prior studies and there may be mild early pulmonary edema.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 2.1 cm from the carina.
 2.  Contusions of the right lung.
 3.  Minimal increased heart size and early mild pulmonary edema may reflect
 fluid resuscitation.
