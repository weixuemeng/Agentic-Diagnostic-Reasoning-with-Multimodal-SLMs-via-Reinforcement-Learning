                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left IJ line placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Left
 internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating at the
 brachiocephalic/SVC confluence without evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Perihilar opacities suggest
 pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left IJ terminates at the brachiocephalic/SVC junction without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  
 2.  Cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema, suggest CHF,
 underlying infection not excluded.
