                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in
 size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Air under the hemidiaphragms is
 likely consistent with recent laparoscopic surgery, 3 days prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with intraperitoneal air likely due
 to recent surgery.
