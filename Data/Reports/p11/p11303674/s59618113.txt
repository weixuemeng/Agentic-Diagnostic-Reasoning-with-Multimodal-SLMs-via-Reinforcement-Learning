 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP or chest radiograph

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are stable with increased prominence of linear atelectasis
 the left lung base.  The vascular pedicle has decreased in size and there is

 Increased atelectasis and mild slightly improved pulmonary edema, unlikely to
