                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with seizure activity // Eval for infxn
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Underpenetrated technique
 limits assessment.  Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 within normal limits.  On the lateral projection an 11 mm nodular structure
 projecting over the mid thoracic spine is noted.  Otherwise the visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nodular structure projecting over the thoracic spine on lateral view warrants
 CT of the chest on a nonemergent basis to exclude underlying lesion.
