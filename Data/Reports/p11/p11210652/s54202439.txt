                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dyspnea, evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is identified.  The thoracic aorta is
 generally widened and elongated and this includes the ascending portion. 
 There is however no evidence of local contour abnormalities.  Relatively high
 positioned diaphragms are present and account for crowded appearance of the
 pulmonary vasculature on the bases.  In addition, there are a few linear thin
 peripheral plate atelectasis but no evidence of acute pneumonic infiltrates is
 present.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No acute
 infiltrates in the lung fields bilaterally and no pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  Degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine have advanced
 somewhat, but no local vertebral body compression fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with poor inspirational effort and low
 respiratory volumes with basal plate atelectasis but no evidence of acute
 pneumonic infiltrate.
