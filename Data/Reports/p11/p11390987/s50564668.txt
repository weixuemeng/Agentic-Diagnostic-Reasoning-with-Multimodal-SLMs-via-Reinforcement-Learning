                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worse dyspnea on exertion and hypoxemia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 Substantial cardiomegaly is unchanged with predominantly enlarged right heart,
 although in part, it can be related to the presence of substantial pectus
 excavatum.  There is no appreciable pulmonary edema demonstrated.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion seen, although small amount cannot be entirely
 excluded, particularly on the right.  The lungs are well inflated.  Chronic
 scarring in the right mid lung is redemonstrated.  Overall, no substantial
 change since prior examination is seen.  Specifically, there is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema or interval development of interstitial lung disease.
