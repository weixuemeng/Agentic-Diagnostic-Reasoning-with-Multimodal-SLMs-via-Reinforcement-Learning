                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset atrial flutter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is stable.  Aorta remains unfolded, with the ascending aorta
 demonstrating a prominent contour, compatible with dilatation as noted on
 prior CT.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Scarring within the right
 mid and lower lung fields appears unchanged.  The left lung demonstrates
 minimal atelectatic changes in the left lung base.  Scarring within the lung
 apices is chronic.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated with evidence of emphysema.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures, with mild loss of height of the L2
 vertebral body which appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic scarring within
 the right lung.  Emphysema.
