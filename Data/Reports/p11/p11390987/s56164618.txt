                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, with dense
 atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch again noted.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise stable with dilatation of the ascending aorta
 and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged. Emphysematous changes are again noted within the upper lobes. Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  Scarring within the lung apices is stable.  Linear
 opacities within the right mid lung field also appear relatively unchanged and
 appear compatible with scarring/post radiation changes.  There may be trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are again seen within the thoracic spine, without an
 acute osseous abnormality seen.  Clips are noted within the right chest wall,
 compatible with prior lumpectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
