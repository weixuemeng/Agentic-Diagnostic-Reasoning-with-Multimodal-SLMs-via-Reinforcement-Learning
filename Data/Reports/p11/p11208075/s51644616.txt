                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest tube to water seal and apical PTX
 and hypotension  // change in apical PTX      change in apical PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the chest tube on
 water seal, there is little change in the appearance of the apical
 pneumothorax. Remainder of the study shows some increasing opacification at
 the right base consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.
 This could in part be related to positional change of the patient.
