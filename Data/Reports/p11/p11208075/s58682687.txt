                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // r/o fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated.  There is prominence of central pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 may be a trace left pleural effusion but no large pleural effusion is seen. 
 Previously seen bilateral upper lung opacities has decreased in the interval
 on have essentially resolved.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette are
 stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The study has low sensitivity in detecting
 a rib fracture.  If high clinical concern, consider dedicated rib series or
 CT.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
