                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest.
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits without change. Bilateral
 upper lobe volume loss and scarring are similar. However, there are new
 confluent opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula and left lower lobe,
 possibly with accompanying bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe and
 lingula.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal parenchymal opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula and left
 lower lobe, with possible accompanying bronchiectasis.  In the setting of
 chronic cough, these findings could be due to chronic atypical mycobacterial
 infection, although an acute pneumonic process is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 If warranted clinically, chest CT could be obtained to more fully evaluate the
 lung parenchyma and airways, particularly if acute infectious symptoms are
 absent.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 13:33 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
