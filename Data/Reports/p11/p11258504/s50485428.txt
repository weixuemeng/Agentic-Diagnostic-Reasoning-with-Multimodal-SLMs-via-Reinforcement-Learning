                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess position of the new right IJ catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 2 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: Supine portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates in the mid trachea.  Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and
 out of view.  Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Increasing bibasilar opacities
 could be due to hypoventilation resulting in atelectasis; however aspiration
 should be considered.  Cardiac size and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increasing bibasilar opacities could be due to hypoventilation
 resulting in atelectasis, however aspiration should be considered.
