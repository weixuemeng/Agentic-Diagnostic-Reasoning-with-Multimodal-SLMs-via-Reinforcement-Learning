                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for
 projectional and positional differences.  No focal areas of consolidation are
 evident within the lungs to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  However, if
 clinical suspicion persists, standard PA and lateral views of the chest would
 be suggested for more complete evaluation, particularly for better assessment
 of the lung bases.
