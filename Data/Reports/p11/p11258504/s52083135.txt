                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke history, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged but
 unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not completely excluded.
