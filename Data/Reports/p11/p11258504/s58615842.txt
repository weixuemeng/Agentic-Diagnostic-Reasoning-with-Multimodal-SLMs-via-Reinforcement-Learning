                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent stroke and aspiration event now intubated.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ image ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Lung volumes are lower, which accentuates the bronchovascular
 structures.  Persistent opacification of the left lung base, either
 atelectasis or aspiration.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  There
 is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged and normal.
 
 Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 3.2 cm above the carina.  A
 right internal jugular catheter and enteric tube are proper.
 
 IMPRESSION: Exceedingly low lung volumes with persistent left lung
 consolidation which could be aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis depending on
 the clinical setting.
