 HISTORY:  Likely aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right IJ line and NG tube are unchanged.  There continues to be moderate
 cardiomegaly with a slightly increased globular appearance to the heart.  Lung
 volumes are low and it is difficult to assess for an early infiltrate
 particularly in the lower lobes.  Follow up is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite infiltrate.
