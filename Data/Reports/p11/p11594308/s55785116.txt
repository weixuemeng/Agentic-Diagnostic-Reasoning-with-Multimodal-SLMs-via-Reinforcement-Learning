                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, ___ edema.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph earlier on the same date and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the earlier chest radiograph, there is persistent patchy
 airspace opacity in the left lung base.  Blunting of the left lateral
 costophrenic angles compatible with a fat pad.  Increased opacity in the right
 lower lung likely reflects same process of atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Calcified,
 tortuous thoracic aorta is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.
