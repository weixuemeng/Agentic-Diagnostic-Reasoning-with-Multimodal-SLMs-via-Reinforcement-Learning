                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new onset of AFib.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 Postoperative changes from gastric pull-through are again seen, with more
 prominent contour at the right lung base medially from the neoesophagus. 
 There is superimposed region of increased consolidation at the right lung base
 as well.  Right upper lung and left lung are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the right lung base when compared to most
 recent prior from ___, some in part due to more prominent
 appearance of the gastric pull-through; however, there is superimposed
 parenchymal opacity in the lung as well, which could represent infection or
 aspiration.  Clinical correlation suggested.
