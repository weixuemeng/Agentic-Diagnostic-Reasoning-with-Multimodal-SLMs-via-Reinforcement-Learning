                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and PET-CT dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dizziness.  Patient has a history of esophageal cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Postoperative
 changes in the mediastinum relate to prior gastric pull-through and
 esophagectomy.  There are subtle lower lung opacities noted bilaterally, which
 appear new from prior exam and could represent a very early pneumonia versus
 atelectasis.  No overt signs of pulmonary edema.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Clips in the mediastinum
 noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative changes with vague lower lung opacities,
 which could represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
