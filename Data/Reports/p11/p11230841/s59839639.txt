                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // assess tube placement, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the ET tube is situated 6 cm above the carina, at the thoracic
 inlet.  The enteric tube terminates at the gastric fundus with the side port
 above the GE junction.
 
 There is an large hazy opacity encompassing most of the right lung field as
 well as hazy opacity at the left mid and lower lung zones.  These are
 concerning for multi focal pneumonia.  There is also a small right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right heart border is obscured by the
 post tunnels passes, allowing for this, cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   ET tube 6 cm above the carina.
 2.  NG tube sideport overlies the lower mediastinum, proximal to the GE
 junction.  Distal tip of the NG tube is likely immediately beyond the GE
 junction.
 3.  Findings concerning for multi focal pneumonia/aspiration.  The possibility
 of distinguishing an acute from chronic component would be difficult in this
 setting.
 4.  Small right pleural effusion.
