 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Back surgery, wheezing, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The right internal jugular vein catheter remains in place.  There
 is unchanged evidence of small lung volumes with moderate cardiomegaly but
 without evidence of overt pulmonary edema or newly appeared parenchymal
 opacities suggesting pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.
