                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cerebellar mass  // Intubated, tube
 placement      Intubated, tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 New endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles.  Kyphotic
 patient positioning distorts the relative location of the tube tip and
 landmarks, but the tip is probably 2 or 3 cm above optimal placement.  In
 addition a second tube or sleeve device is present in the upper airway and I
 do not recognize.
 Lung volumes are low and early edema is probably present.  Heart is enlarged
 but partially obscured.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax and any pleural
 effusion is small.
