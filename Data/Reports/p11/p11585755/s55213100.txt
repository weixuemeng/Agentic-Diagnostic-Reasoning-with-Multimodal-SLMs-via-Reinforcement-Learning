                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic graft, status post motor vehicle accident, evaluation for
 mediastinal changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  An aneurysmal dilatation
 of the aorta cannot be detected.  There is no pleural effusion, no left
 mediastinal widening and no apical cap that could suggest an acute aortic
 injury.  However, given the lack of previous comparisons, short-term
 radiographic followup should be performed and the images should be
 re-evaluated accordingly.
 
 Status post sternotomy.  Mild increase in diameter of the hilar pulmonary
 vessels.
 
 No substantial atelectasis.  No lung nodules or masses.
