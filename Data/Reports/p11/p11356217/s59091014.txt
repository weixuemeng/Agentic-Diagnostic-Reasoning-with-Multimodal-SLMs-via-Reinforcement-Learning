                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, history of ascending aortic stenting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi of the rectus AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple clips noted in the
 mediastinum.  Enlargement of the mediastinal contour is compatible with a
 massive pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta.  The remainder of the
 mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  There is continued moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions,
 left greater than right, are present, perhaps slightly decreased in size on
 the right and increase in size on the left.  Bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic
 spine is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  Status post ascending
 aortic stent placement and re- demonstration of known large pseudoaneurysm of
 the ascending aorta.
