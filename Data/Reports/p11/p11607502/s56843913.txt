                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, status
 post transbronchial biopsy on the right, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable PA semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is top normal size.  Widening of the mediastinum is
 consistent with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as seen on CT scan. 
 Lung volumes are low with atelectasis seen in both bases.  There is an opacity
 projecting over the mid right lung likely corresponding to the site of
 intervention possibly reflecting hemorrhage in that region.  Neighboring hilar
 region also appears to have increased in size, likely secondary to the same
 process.  Left lung is clear.  No significant pleural effusions, and no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Focal opacification of the mid right lung likely represent post-surgical
 changes and is consistent with hemorrhage and/or atelectasis.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
