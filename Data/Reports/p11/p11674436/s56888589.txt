                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 medial right base opacity is felt to likely be due to overlap of structures. 
 No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Medial right base opacity is felt to most likely be due to
 overlap of structures; however, given history of hemoptysis, should consider
 non-urgent chest CT, which is more sensitive.
