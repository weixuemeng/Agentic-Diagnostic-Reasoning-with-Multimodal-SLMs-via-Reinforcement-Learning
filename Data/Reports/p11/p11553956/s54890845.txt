                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right shoulder pain and weakness. Evaluate for mass impinging on
 the right brachial plexus.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Aortic tortuosity is stable.  Hilar contours are normal.  No
 pulmonary or soft tissue mass is seen. However, cross-sectional imaging may be
 more informative to answer this clinical question if the shoulder pain is from
 neurologic etiology.
