                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion, recent chest tube
 removal, and new diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma.  // Is effusion loculated,
 any evidence of hematoma around L chest where chest tube was removed?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left mid to lower lung opacification now has a bulging contour. This
 likely represents a combination of dense atelectasis from collapse of superior
 segment of the lower lobe and small to moderate pleural effusion rather than
 loculated pleural effusion.  The remaining left lung is clear without
 consolidation.  The right lung is clear without consolidation.  The hila and
 pulmonary vasculatures are grossly unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The worsening left lung opacification likely represents a combination of dense
 atelectasis and small to moderate pleural effusion rather than loculated
 pleural effusion alone.
