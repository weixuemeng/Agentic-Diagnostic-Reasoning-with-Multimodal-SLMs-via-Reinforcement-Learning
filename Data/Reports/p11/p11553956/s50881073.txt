                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with large left pleural effusion s/p chest tube
 placement  // evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left pleural catheter
 remains in place, with increased left pleural effusion, now moderate in size. 
 Diffuse opacities in the left mid and lower lung have rapidly developed in
 could potentially represent an acute aspiration event in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Some of the opacities have a tubular quality, suggesting
 the possibility of mucous plugging.  No other relevant change.
