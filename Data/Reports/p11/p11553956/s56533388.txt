                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  In comparison with the study of ___, there again is extensive
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 left pleural effusion and underlying atelectatic changes.  Some of the pleural
 fluid could well be loculated.  The pulmonary vessels are somewhat more
 prominent, suggesting the possibility of increased pulmonary venous pressure. 
 The the dense streak of atelectasis at the right base has substantially
 decreased.
 Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
