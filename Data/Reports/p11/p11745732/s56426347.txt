  Lung volumes are low. Mild cardiomegaly is grossly unchanged. There is
  bibasilar atelectasis. Low lung volumes results in vascular crowding. There
  may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema. There
  is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Htn, multiple PEs with fever and dyspnea. 
 // Eval for edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New linear opacities in the mid and lower lung zones most likely early
 pulmonary edema. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pleural effusions are to
 evaluate, small if any.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified and tortuous but
 not fully assessed by this study. Left lower lobe is obscured by the large
 cardiac silhouette and could contain pneumonia. Conventional frontal and
 lateral views are recommended when feasible.
