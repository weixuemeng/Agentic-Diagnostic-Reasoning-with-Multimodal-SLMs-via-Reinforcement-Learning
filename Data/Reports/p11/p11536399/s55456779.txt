                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Neutropenia.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No
 bone abnormalities worrisome for infection or neoplasm is demonstrated, within
 the limitations of this study technique.  If patient's symptoms are suspicious
 for pulmonary infection, chest CT to exclude the possibility of pulmonary
 infection in a neutropenic patient should be obtained.
