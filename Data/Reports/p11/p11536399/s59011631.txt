                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Febrile neutropenia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a patchy vague opacity projecting over the
 left mid lung, which is difficult to delineate owing to overlapping structures
 including bones and EKG leads.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left mid lung opacity, possibly infectious.  For
 confirmation and to assess further, acquisition of short-term follow-up chest
 radiographs, preferably with standard PA and lateral technique, is suggested
 when feasible.
