  There has been interval decrease in size of the large left pleural effusion,
  with improved aeration of the left upper lobe. Persistent retrocardiac
  opacification likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and
  collapse. The endotracheal tube, left upper extremity PICC, and right pigtail
  pleural drainage catheter are in unchanged position. The heart remains
  enlarged.  No pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been decrease in

 combination of pleural effusion and collapse. Monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. The right lung is clear.
