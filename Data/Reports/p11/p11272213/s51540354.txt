 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia, sepsis and PEA arrest w/ ROSC
 after 2 minutes CPR +epi  // Please assess for new cardiopulmonary process    
 Please assess for new cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these earlier study of this day, there has been the
 development of 80 right pneumothorax with virtual complete collapse of the
 right upper lobe.  On a subsequent image dictated previously, there has been
 placement of right chest tube and re-expansion of the right lung.  Increased
 patchy opacification on the left probably reflects asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed areas of consolidation would
 have to be considered.
