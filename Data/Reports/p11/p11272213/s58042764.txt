                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting
 of HCAP, pneumothorax after PEA arrest last night, intubated s/p bronch.  //
 reasess ET tube, chest tube placement and pneumothorax after bronch.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in extent of the
 basal component of the right pleural effusion. However, the apical lung,
 overlay in the tip of the pigtail catheter, shows increased air space
 opacities, suggestive of either new pneumonia or local bleeding. The CT
 pattern documented on ___, 15:03, is a rather suggestive of
 pneumonia than of bleeding.
 Similar opacities also seen at the apical aspect of the middle lobe as well as
 at the left lung bases.
 Mild cardiomegaly with mild left pleural effusion.  Monitoring and support
 devices and stabilization devices are in unchanged position.
