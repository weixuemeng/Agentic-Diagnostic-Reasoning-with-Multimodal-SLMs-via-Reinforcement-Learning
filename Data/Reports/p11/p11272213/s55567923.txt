 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 14:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 07:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right pigtail catheter projects over the upper hemithorax and no
 pneumothorax is seen. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip
 approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line is likely
 unchanged in position.
 
 There has been interval near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax
 which likely represents a combination of collapsed lung, possibly related to
 mucus plugging, and layering left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity in the
 right upper lung may represent an area of aspiration or pneumonia and is not
 significantly changed.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Spinal hardware is
 seen overlying the visualized cervical and upper thoracic spine.
