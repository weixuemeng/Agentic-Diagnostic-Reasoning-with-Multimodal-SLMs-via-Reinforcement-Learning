                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a streaky increased opacity at the medial lung base including a new
 band-like opacity in the right middle lobe, although more suggestive of
 atelectasis than pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New vague medial right basilar opacity, probably due to minor
 atelectasis.  If clinical concern for the possibility of pneumonia were to
 persist, however, then short-term followup radiographs could be considered,
 however, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if feasible.
