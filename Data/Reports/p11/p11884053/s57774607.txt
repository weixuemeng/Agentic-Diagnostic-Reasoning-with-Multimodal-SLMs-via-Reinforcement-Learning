                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with question of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day CT C-spine.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a large right apical bulla,
 compatible with findings on recent prior CT of the cervical spine.  Relative
 left apical lucency is consistent with known paraseptal emphysema.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged. Mild prominence of interstital markings could be
 secondary to crowding by bulla or could reflect an element of intertitial
 parenchymal change. Relative opacity in left mid- and lower zones may reflect
 atelectasis and accentuation by oblique positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Large right apical bulla.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Pulmonary findings, as decsribed above.
