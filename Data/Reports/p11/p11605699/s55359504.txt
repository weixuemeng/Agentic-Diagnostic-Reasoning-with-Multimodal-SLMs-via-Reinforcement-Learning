 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with lethargy and decreased urine output.
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, CT Chest ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 lateral view is limited by patient's inability to raise her right arm.  There
 is no focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 sulcus is unchanged from ___ and may represent pleural thickening.  Tiny
 rounded calcifications in the right upper lung correspond to a pleural-based
 plaque with internal calcification on CT chest ___.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is unchanged. The thoracic aorta is tortuous and generally large. The intimal
 calcification at the aortic knob is far from the edge but unchanged from
 ___. The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 intimal calcification far from edge. doesnt necessarily mean that intima is
 not elevated (in dissection). 
 
 film in ___ where teh ao knob looks at least as peculiar. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No pneumonia or edema.
 2. Aortic knob intimal calcification is far from the edge, unchanged from
 ___. Due to aortic tortuosity, it is uninterpretable. This would warrant
 further evaluation if there is good clinical evidence for dissection.
