 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___

 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 and moderate cardiomegaly remain.  There are regions of consolidation at both

 be necessary to confirm this with chest CT scanning.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard
 placements.
