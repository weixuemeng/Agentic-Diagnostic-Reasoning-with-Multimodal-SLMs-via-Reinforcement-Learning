                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued bibasilar
 opacification, more prominent on the right, most likely reflecting pleural
 fluid and volume loss in the lower lobes.  Low lung volumes may be
 accentuating the pulmonary vasculature, which appears less prominent than on
 the prior study.  The monitoring and support devices remain in place.
