 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of relatively extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, mainly in the
 perihilar and lower lung zones.  The extent and severity of the opacities have
 not substantially changed.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus,
 potentially indicative of a small pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly.  No
 pneumothorax.
