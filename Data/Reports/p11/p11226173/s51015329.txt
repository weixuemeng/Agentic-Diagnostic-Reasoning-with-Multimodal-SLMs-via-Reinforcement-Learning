                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute kidney injury in setting of
 sepsis.  Questionable orogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Previously identified double-lumen dialysis line entered
 via right internal jugular approach remains in unchanged position terminating
 in lower SVC and right atrium.  An orogastric tube can now be identified, seen
 to pass well through the esophagus and reaching below the diaphragm. 
 Additional images were made over the upper abdominal area demonstrating tube
 to reach well below the diaphragm, the tip of the line exceeds the imaged
 field.  One can identify portions of the tube's end to be a dense metallic
 structure likely representing a Dobbhoff line.  Thus, the line appears to
 terminate in the corpus of the stomach.  Chest findings are rather unaltered
 since the next preceding study of ___.
