                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ACUTE ONSET SHORTNESS OF BREATH, question CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and
 cephalization of the hilar vessels with peribronchial cuffing, this likely
 represents pulmonary edema in the setting of congestive heart failure.  There
 are diffuse patchy opacities, some of which appear nodular.  These are better
 seen on concurrent chest CT.  These may relate to pulmonary edema, but
 superimposed infection is not excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
