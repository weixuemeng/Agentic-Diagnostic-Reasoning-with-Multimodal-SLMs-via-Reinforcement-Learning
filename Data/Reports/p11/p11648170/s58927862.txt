                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NASH cirrhosis with right upper lung consolidation.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe is increased
 compared to the prior radiograph from ___, consistent with
 pneumonia on recent CT from ___.  There is mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, not significantly changed.  A moderate left pleural effusion
 is increased.  Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis is again seen.  There is
 also subsegmental right lower lung atelectasis.  The heart size is difficult
 to assess but is likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are not
 significantly changed.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in right upper lung consolidative opacity, consistent with
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  Increased moderate left pleural effusion with persistent dense left
 retrocardiac and minimal right lower lung atelectasis.
 
 3.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, not significantly changed.
