                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:13 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Liver failure and acute hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous moderate left pleural effusion is smaller.  No pneumothorax.  Small
 right pleural effusion is new or appreciably larger and moderate-to-severe
 pulmonary edema is new.  Because of rotation, I cannot tell whether there is
 appreciable left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
