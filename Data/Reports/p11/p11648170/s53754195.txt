                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion is
 noted, decreased in size compared to the previous exam.  Retrocardiac opacity
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as well as
 involving the acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion, the latter of which is
 improved compared to the prior study.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
