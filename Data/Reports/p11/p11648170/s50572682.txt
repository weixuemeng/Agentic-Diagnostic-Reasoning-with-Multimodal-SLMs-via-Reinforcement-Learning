                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube and right IJ line are unchanged.  The left pleural
 effusion is still moderate in size, but is slightly smaller than on the prior
 study.  There continues to be dense opacity in the perihilar regions
 bilaterally in the retrocardiac region with infiltrate/volume loss in both
 lower lungs.  There is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in left effusions with continued CHF.  An
 underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
