                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and anemia.  History of NASH, cirrhosis and
 varices.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___,  left pleural
 effusion remains unchanged with associated lower lobe opacity likely
 representing atelectasis or pneumonia.  There are increased opacities at the
 right lung base, which likely represent atelectasis.  The heart appears
 enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Irregularity at the left humerus
 likely reflects the sequelae of prior injury. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged left pleural effusion with associated lower lobe opacity
 could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema.
