 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the left
 pleural effusion has minimally increased.  The right pleural effusion is
 constant in extent and distribution.  There is unchanged evidence of
 relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis as well as of cardiomegaly
 and moderate pulmonary edema.  No new parenchymal opacities.  The left PICC
 line is unchanged.
