                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  There is
 pleural effusion with associated lower lobe opacity, likely representing
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  The right lung remains clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable, though suboptimally
 assessed on this AP portable radiograph.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left effusion with left basal consolidation which
 could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  Limited exam due to rotation and
 portable technique.
