  Enteric tube has been withdrawn.  Advancement by 7 cm would position the
  gastric side port in the stomach.  Remaining support devices are satisfactory.
  Large bilateral pleural effusions and multifocal airspace opacities are
  unchanged, compatible with severe pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the enteric tube
 has been pulled back slightly, so that the side hole is apparently above the
 esophagogastric junction.  The tube should be pushed forward several
 centimeters.  The other monitoring and support devices are within normal
 limits.
 
 Again, there are large layering pleural effusions with substantial pulmonary
 edema.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.
