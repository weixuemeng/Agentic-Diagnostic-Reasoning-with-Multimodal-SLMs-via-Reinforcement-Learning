                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with NASH cirrhosis, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 459.
 
 Portal semi-supine chest film ___ at 3:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A persistent consolidation in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe is
 seen and is concerning for pneumonia.  There are bilateral effusions, left
 much greater than the right and therefore it is possible that some of the left
 lower lobe consolidation could reflect compressive atelectasis rather than an
 acute infectious process.  There continues to be indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature which has slightly worsened suggesting an element of
 superimposed pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the diffuse airspace process.
