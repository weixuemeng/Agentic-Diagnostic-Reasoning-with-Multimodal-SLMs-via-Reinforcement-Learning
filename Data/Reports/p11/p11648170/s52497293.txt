                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest redemonstrates low tip position of
 left PICC with tip likely in the upper right atrium, but similar as compared
 to prior exam.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is new pleural effusion and
 retrocardiac consolidation, which could represent atelectasis and/or
 consolidation, certainly could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The upper left lung and right lung are well aerated.  There is no
 pneumothorax, florid pulmonary edema, or right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left pleural effusion with basal atelectasis and/or
 consolidation, in the appropriate clinical setting could represent pneumonia.
