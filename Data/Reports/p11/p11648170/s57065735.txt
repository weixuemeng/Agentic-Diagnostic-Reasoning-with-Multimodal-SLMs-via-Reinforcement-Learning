                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  MRI of the abdomen from ___.
 
 Moderate to large left and small right pleural effusions are present.  The
 right pleural effusion is probably similar in size to the prior MRI of the
 abdomen, but the left pleural effusion is likely slightly larger, although
 differences in positioning and imaging modalities limit direct comparison. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Visualized cardiac contours are
 normal, but left effusion obscures part of the left heart border.  The
 effusion also results in partial atelectasis of the lingula and left lower
 lobe.  Remaining portions of the lungs are clear.  There are no acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Moderate to large left and small right pleural effusion, with apparent
 increase in size of left pleural effusion since MRI of the abdomen of ___.
