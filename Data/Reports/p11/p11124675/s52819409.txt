 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:17.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the endotracheal tube has been replaced by a tracheostomy tube. 
 The position of the tracheostomy tube is unremarkable, its tip projects
 approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.
 
 The course of the nasogastric tube and the right PICC line are unchanged. 
 Slightly more severe than on the previous exam are the very widespread
 bilateral parenchymal opacities, that has a reticulonodular appearance on the
 image.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and a
 likely very small left effusion.
