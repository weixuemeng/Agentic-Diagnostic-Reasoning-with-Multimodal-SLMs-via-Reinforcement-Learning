                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CIOD, OSA, hypoxic failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm off film.  A right IJ central line is
 present, tip over distal IJ, near confluence with subclavian. A PICC line is
 present, tip partially obscured, but likely overlying distal SVC.  
 
 There is rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, there is probable
 cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is some patchy retrocardiac opacity,
 with air bronchograms, though the left hemidiaphragm remains visible.  No
 gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Lines and tubes, as described.  
 2.  Probable cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 3.  CHF, with interstitial edema.  
 4.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
