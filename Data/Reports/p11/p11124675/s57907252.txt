                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with acute increase in FiO2  requirement,
 concern for aspiration or acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently portable AP radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior radiograph, the lung volumes are increased; however,
 there appears to be increased bilateral diffuse opacities likely due to
 pulmonary edema.  A more focal consolidation at the right base is concerning
 for atelectasis or possible aspiration.  ET tube is 7 cm from the carina.  NG
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of bilateral diffuse opacities in the setting
 of increased lung volumes is concerning for worsening  pulmonary edema.  Also
 focal opacity at the right base may represent aspiration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 4 p.m.
