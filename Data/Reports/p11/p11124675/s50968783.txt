                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia, here to evaluate for pneumonia or fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___; ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are improved from the prior studies
 with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. 
 There is evidence of minimal interstitial fluid overload with engorged
 pulmonary vasculature.  Hazy opacification at the left lung base may represent
 attenuation of soft tissues.  No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent but stable in comparison to the prior study.  The trachea is
 midline.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of minimal interstitial fluid overload and pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
