                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure thought to be ARDS,
 question interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the most recent prior radiograph, the lung volumes are low. 
 There is now increasing opacity at the right lower lung zone most likely due
 to aspiration.  Also seen is increased prominence of pulmonary vasculature
 likely worsening pulmonary edema.  ET tube is 3.3 cm from the carina.  NG tube
 is seen but cannot be followed distal to the diaphragm.  There is a right PICC
 line which is unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing opacity in the right lower lung zone consistent with
 aspiration.
 2.  Worsening pulmonary edema and low lung volumes.
 
 These findings are communicated with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
