   Intestinal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view. If
  visualization of the tip is desired, abdominal radiograph could be performed.
  Other support lines and tubes unchanged. Mild to moderate interstitial edema.
  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, most likely representing atelectasis, with
  possible pleural effusions. Findings and imaging options discussed with Dr.

  review.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 An NG-type tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the
 film.  An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 5.5
 cm above the carina.  A right IJ sheath is present.  A right subclavian PICC
 line is present, the tip is not optimally delineated, but likely lies in the
 region of the distal SVC/RA junction.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably stable. 
 Vascular plethora and blurring is consistent with interstitial edema. 
 Increased retrocardiac density is consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion, though small effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.
