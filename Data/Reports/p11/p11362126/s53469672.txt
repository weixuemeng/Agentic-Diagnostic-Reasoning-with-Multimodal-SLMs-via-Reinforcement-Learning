                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest and resuscitation.  Interval
 evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent of the same date
 obtained approximately one hour prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  No significant interval change is seen in widespread left-sided
 opacification consistent with extensive pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  A small left pleural effusion may be present.  An endotracheal
 tube is in standard position.  A right internal jugular venous catheter tip is
 in the SVC.  An esophageal catheter is in place with tip in the stomach and
 side port at the region of the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant change in widespread left-sided pneumonia.
 
 2.  Esophageal catheter with tip in the stomach and side port at the level of
 the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced to ensure side port
 within the stomach.
