                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD and asthma, who
 was transferred from outside hospital with left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation appears to be unchanged.  The position of tubes
 and lines is unchanged.  Left mediastinal shift most likely reflects the
 presence of left lower lung atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
