                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 19:20
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right IJ.  Evaluate for line placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:11.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 19:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of right IJ central venous line with its tip in the
 proximal superior vena cava.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic
 inlet.  There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach, but the sideport near the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Advancement of the nasogastric tube may be helpful to minimize the
 risk of aspiration.  Persistent consolidation in the left upper lobe and
 lingula with relative sparing of the left lower lobe is seen.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Right effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Results of this examination were conveyed
 directly by phone to Dr. ___ at 9:50 p.m. on ___ by Dr. ___
 ___.
