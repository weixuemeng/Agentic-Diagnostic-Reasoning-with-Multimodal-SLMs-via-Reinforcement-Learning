                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia status post cardiac arrest
 and possible pneumothorax seen on post-arrest chest film.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 22:43.
 
 A portable AP supine chest from ___ at 10:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina.  Right internal
 jugular central line has it tip in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the
 side port near the gastroesophageal junction.  Advancement would be
 recommended to minimize the risk of aspiration as previously recommended on
 multiple prior studies and communicated to Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:50 p.m.
 by Dr. ___.
 2.  There continues to be airspace disease involving the left lung,
 predominantly in the left upper lobe and lingula.  There is a more
 consolidative opacity laterally in the left mid to lower lung which could
 represent a loculated effusion.  Right lung remains grossly clear.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
