                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD.  Intubated status post cardiac arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ obtained at approximately 7:30
 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there is no significant interval change in large
 left-sided airspace opacification consistent with pneumonia.  A relative
 lucency in the left base likely represents a small amount of aerated lung
 adjacent to the consolidation.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  There may
 be a small left pleural effusion.  The heart size appears within normal
 limits.  An endotracheal tube is in standard position.  A right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip reaches the upper SVC.  An esophageal
 catheter is in place with tip in the stomach, however, side port likely within
 the distal esophagus or just at the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in extensive left-sided pneumonia.
 
 2.  Esophageal catheter with tip in stomach, however, side port in distal
 esophagus or at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced to ensure
 side port is within the stomach.
