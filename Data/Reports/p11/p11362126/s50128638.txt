                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with past medical history of COPD and
 asthma, transferred from outside hospital with left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Went into PEA arrest upon arrival to MICU.  Status post resuscitation on
 ___ Sun cooling protocol.  Is there any pulmonary edema?
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. 
 Positions of previously described ETT and right internal jugular approach
 central venous line are unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The
 previously identified extensive pulmonary infiltrates in the left hemithorax
 remain.  They have been located on previous CT (___) to involve
 almost exclusively the left upper lobe and extending into the lingula.  These
 abnormalities persist and have not undergone any major interval change since
 the next preceding examination.  As has been reviewed on previous
 examinations, pulmonary vasculature never showed any conclusive evidence for
 marked venous congestion, and there is no evidence for pulmonary congestive
 edema.  On this latest portable image, one can identify a small stent
 resembling metallic structure, approximately 7 mm wide and 12 mm long,
 overlying the area of the left main bronchus.  It is unclear from the chest
 film if this relates to any intrabronchial intervention.
 
 An NG tube reaches well below the diaphragm and terminates in the moderately
 gas-distended stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
