                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, and the aorta demonstrates mild tortuosity.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus likely
 reflects a small right pleural effusion.  Minimal linear opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Hyperinflation of the lungs possibly reflects underlying COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Trace right pleural effusion and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
