                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a new onset of atrial fibrillation and a dry
 cough.  Is there any pleural effusion or changing cardiac silhouette?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Mild
 interval increase in caliber of the heart could be due to difference in
 cardiac cycle.  Even apparent increase in caliber of the left atrium could be
 physiologic.  There is no change in borderline vascular engorgement, and there
 is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  I doubt that there is acute
 cardiac decompensation.
