                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post placement of a left-sided dual-chamber
 pacemaker, with leads terminating in the expected locations of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomegaly is stable in appearance allowing for lower lung volumes, the
 latter also accentuate the pulmonary vascularity.  New linear foci of
 atelectasis have developed in both lower lobes.  Calcified granulomas are
 present in the right upper lobe without change.  Note is made of previous
 median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post pacemaker placement with no evidence of pneumothorax.
