                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy,
 aortic valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Streaky opacity within the
 right lung base is most likely reflective of atelectasis, though early
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Calcified granuloma measuring 2-3 mm within the right upper lung
 field is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal streaky opacity in the right lung base may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
