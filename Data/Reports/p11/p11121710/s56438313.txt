 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:46 PM
  Streaky opacities identified at the lung bases bilaterally.  These may all be
  due to scarring and probable bronchiectasis however underlying lesion or
  infection is also possible.  Correlation with older films would be of use to
  document long-term stability.  Alternatively, CT scan could be considered to
  further characterize if no prior imaging

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dark vomiting, several episodes yesterday.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is streaky right basilar opacity
 which may be due to atelectasis versus scarring.  Less well-defined opacities
 at the left lung base are identified, particularly laterally.  There is
 inferior traction of the left hilum suggestive of a component of scarring.  On
 the lateral view, there is increased opacity in the posterior costophrenic
 sulcus, likely on the left with probable associated bronchiectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.  Old healed right posterior 4th rib fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky opacities identified at the lung bases bilaterally.  These may all be
 due to scarring and probable bronchiectasis however underlying lesion or
 infection is also possible.  Correlation with older films would be of use to
 document long-term stability.  Alternatively, CT scan should be considered to
 further characterize if no prior imaging is available.
