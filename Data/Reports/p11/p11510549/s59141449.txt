                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CHF, AFib, ICD, new stroke, increased white blood cell count,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and portable view of the chest.  There is new diffuse hazy
 opacities in lungs bilaterally and also increase in fullness of the hila
 bilaterally, which may represent new pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  A small retrocardiac opacity appears to
 be slightly increased in size, may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  A
 left-sided ICD is in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is slightly increased in size and may represent
 atelectasis or possibly early pneumonia.
