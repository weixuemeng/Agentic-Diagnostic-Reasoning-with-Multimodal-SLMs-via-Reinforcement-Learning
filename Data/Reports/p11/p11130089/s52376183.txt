                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Reticular markings
 and cuffed airways appear more prominent on the right than left, which appears
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague increased opacification in the right lung concerning for pneumonia. 
 Short-term repeat radiographs may be helpful to confirm particularly if
 discordant with clinical history because asymmetric positioning could
 potentially simulate this appearance.
