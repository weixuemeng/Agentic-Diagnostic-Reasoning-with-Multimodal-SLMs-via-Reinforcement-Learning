                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with heart failure, to assess for worsening effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure has substantially decreased, though some elevation persists.  There
 is bilateral haziness of the hemithoraces, somewhat less than previously,
 again consistent with layering pleural effusion and underlying compressive
 atelectasis.
