                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and outside radiographs and
 CT from earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Hazy opacification of the lung bases
 suggests pleural effusions of substantial size, more conspicuous and probably
 larger on the left than right side.  Fullness of each hilum with indistinct
 contours is suggestive of perihilar congestion, although mild and unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of substantial pleural effusions and mild
 congestion.
