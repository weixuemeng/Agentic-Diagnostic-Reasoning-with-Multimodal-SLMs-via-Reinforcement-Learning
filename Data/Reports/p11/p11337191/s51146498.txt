                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with weakness, confusion, cough  // bleed?infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear right midlung opacity is likely due to atelectasis.  Increased opacity
 in the right paramediastinal region is likely due to consolidation within the
 azygos lobe.  Increased pleural based opacity in the right upper lung
 laterally is compatible with pleural-based based metastases seen on prior
 PET-CT.  New blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle on the frontal
 view may also be due to pleural based disease.  Irregular interstitial
 markings of the periphery of the left lung are better seen on prior CT.  Left
 chest wall Port-A-Cath seen with tip in the region of the low SVC.  Cardiac
 silhouette is stable.  Enlarged right hilum is compatible with known malignant
 adenopathy.  No visualized acute osseous abnormality.  Destruction of the
 anterior right upper ribs was better seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evidence of disease in the chest on the right including pleural-based mass as
 seen on prior PET-CT.  Apparent increased pleural based involvement at the
 right lung base laterally.  Right hilar adenopathy better seen on prior PET. 
 Consolidation within the azygos lobe has progressed since prior PET-CT,
 potentially atelectasis or due to adjacent pleural based disease.
