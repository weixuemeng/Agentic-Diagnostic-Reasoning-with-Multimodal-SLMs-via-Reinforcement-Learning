                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o stage IICovarian carcinoma now with
 SOB and crackles on inspiration left lung greater than right lung  // please
 evaluate for worrisome features
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital torso CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well-expanded with incidental note made
 of an azygos lobe.  Increased interstitial markings at the lung periphery
 bilaterally correlate to subpleural interstitial changes seen on prior CT. 
 The upper abdomen is unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse chronic interstitial changes, as seen on prior chest CT.  No evidence
 for pleural effusion or pneumonia.  No definite evidence of metastatic disease
 by chest radiograph, although chest CT is more sensitive for detection of
 metastatic disease.
