                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough and wheezes and rhonchi on
 lung examination.  Evaluate for infiltrates ? left lower lobe.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size is
 unchanged and remains within normal limits.  Unremarkable appearance of
 thoracic aorta.  No mediastinal abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Deep inspiration results in some flattening of
 the pleural sinuses, but there is no evidence of pleural effusion in the
 lateral or posterior sinuses as they are free.  There is now a moderately
 sized poorly delineated parenchymal infiltrate on the left lung base
 obliterating partially the apical cardiac contour.  The lateral view confirms
 the infiltrate to be located in the peripheral  lingula of the left upper lobe
 located quite anterior and low which matches well the description of the
 positive findings on physical examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acute new infiltrates in left upper lobe lingula.  No other new
 abnormalities.  Followup examination after successful treatment in one to two
 weeks is recommended.
