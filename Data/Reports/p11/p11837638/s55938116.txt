                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with seizures. Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a subtle opacity in the left costophrenic angle with loss of the
 diaphragmatic margin in that region. Otherwise no focal opacities are seen
 elsewhere in the lungs. There is no pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia versus
 atelectasis.
