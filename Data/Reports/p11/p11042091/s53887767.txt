                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates decreased in lung volumes
 and increased reticular opacities compared to prior imaging from ___ years
 before.  In addition, there is a noticeable apicobasal gradient.  There is no
 cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, or evidence of pulmonary edema.  Aside from
 tortuosity of the aorta, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked progression of reticular lung opacities compared to ___.  Decreased lung volumes makes a fibrotic lung process likely. 
 CT chest is recommended for further characterization.
