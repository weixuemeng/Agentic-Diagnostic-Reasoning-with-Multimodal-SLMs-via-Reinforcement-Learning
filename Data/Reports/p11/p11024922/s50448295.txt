                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unremarkable.  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings; however, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Study is mildly limited by underpenetration
 especially on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
