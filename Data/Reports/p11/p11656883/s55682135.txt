 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman h/o osteoporosis with left sided rib pain  //
 fracture?      fracture?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Heart size top-normal improve since ___.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable.  There is no edema or consolidation, and no pleural thickening,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
