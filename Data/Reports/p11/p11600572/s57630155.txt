 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 consolidation and hypoxia  // eval pulm edema, RLL consolidaiton     eval pulm

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial decrease
 in the opacification at the right base an the right hemidiaphragm is much
 better seen.  Small effusion could well be present.
 On the left, there is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent
 with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis.  The right central
 catheter is been removed.
 There is suggestion of some hazy opacification in the right apical region. 
 Some of this may merely represent overlying bony structures and this area
 should be carefully Re evaluated on subsequent images.
