 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPH  // Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET and oro gastric tubes and left-sided pacemaker again noted, similar to the
 prior study.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning and lower inspiratory volumes, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Prominence of the right
 hilum again noted, similar to prior.
 
 Again seen is vascular plethora and blurring, consistent with CHF grossly
 similar to prior.  Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Small
 bilateral effusions again noted.  As before, there is a band of somewhat more
 confluent opacity the junction of the right mid and lower zones.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, CHF, small bilateral effusions, and left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Overall, the appearance is similar to the prior study.
 
 Prominence of the right hilum again noted.
