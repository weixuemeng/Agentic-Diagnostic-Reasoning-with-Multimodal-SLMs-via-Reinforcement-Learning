                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough and oxygen requirement with increasing white blood
 cell count.  Assess for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are hyperexpanded
 with perhaps trace pleural effusions, better assessed on the recent CT
 abdomen/pelvis and minimal basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia is identified.  The heart is moderately enlarged with normal
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Perhaps trace bilateral pleural effusions and moderate
 cardiomegaly without acute intrathoracic process.
