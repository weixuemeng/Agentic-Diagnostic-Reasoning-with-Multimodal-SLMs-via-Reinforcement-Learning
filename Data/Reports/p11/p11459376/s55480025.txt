                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided single-chamber pacemaker lead terminates in the right
 ventricle.  Heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are relatively stable.  There is mild pulmonary edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is scarring within
 the lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, not significantly changed compared to the prior exam.
