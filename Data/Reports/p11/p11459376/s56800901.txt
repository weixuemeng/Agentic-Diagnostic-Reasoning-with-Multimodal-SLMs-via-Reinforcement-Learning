                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left lower extremity trauma and chest
 pain.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct,
 compatible with mild pulmonary edema, improved since ___. 
 Small blunting of the right costophrenic angle and minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle are similar to prior.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is visualized.  Single wire of a left
 chest wall pacer terminates over the right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Improved pulmonary edema, now mild.  Small right and trace left pleural
 effusions, similar to prior.  
 2.  No displaced rib fracture visualized.  Dedicated rib series would increase
 sensitivity for detection of rib fractures.
