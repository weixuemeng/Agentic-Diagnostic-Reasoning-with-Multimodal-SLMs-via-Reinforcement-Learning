                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CVA, spintubation  // proper ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   The patient has been intubated with
 the endotracheal tube seen terminating 2.7 cm above the carina. The
 endogastric tube is seen extending into the left upper quadrant.  Lung volumes
 are low with scattered areas of opacity appearing increased from prior likely
 reflecting atelectasis though a component of aspiration cannot be excluded. No
 supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable. No acute bony injuries.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tubes positioned appropriately. Scattered opacities in the lungs, question
 atelectasis versus aspiration.
