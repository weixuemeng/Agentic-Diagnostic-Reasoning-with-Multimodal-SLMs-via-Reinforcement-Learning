 Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. Lung volumes remain low. More focal patchy opacity is now seen in
 the right mid lung which would be concerning for aspiration, pneumonia or
 patchy atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours appear stable.
