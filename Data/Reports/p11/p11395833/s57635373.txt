                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new seizure  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated. There are relatively low lung volumes and
 mild right base atelectasis. Right basilar opacity projecting over the medial
 right lung base with possible air bronchograms, underlying pneumonia or
 aspiration not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The
 mediastinum is somewhat shifted to the right more so than patient position,
 this could relate to the elevated left diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Elevated left hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis. Additional focus of
 opacity in the medial right lung base with possible air bronchograms could be
 due to infection or aspiration.
