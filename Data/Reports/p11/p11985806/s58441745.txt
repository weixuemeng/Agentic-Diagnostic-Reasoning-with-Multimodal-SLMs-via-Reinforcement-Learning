 Compared to the prior study there has been some interval decrease in the right
 pleural effusion however it is still moderate in size and is layering
 posteriorly.  There has been some interval re-expansion of the right lower
 lobe but volume loss in that region is still present.  An underlying
 infectious infiltrate can't be totally excluded.  The left lung is clear.
