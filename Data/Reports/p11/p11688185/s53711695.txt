                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Please note, given the presence of atelectasis in the lower lungs, a subjacent
 pneumonia would be impossible to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  The
 heart size cannot be assessed.  The mediastinal contour appears unremarkable
 aside from the presence of aortic knob calcification.  The bony structures are
 intact.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities likely
 representing atelectasis, though pneumonia not entirely excluded.
