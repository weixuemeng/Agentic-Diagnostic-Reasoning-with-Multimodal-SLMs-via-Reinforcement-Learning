                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope, to assess for acute pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with tortuosity of the aorta.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Prominence of interstitial markings could reflect
 chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia.
