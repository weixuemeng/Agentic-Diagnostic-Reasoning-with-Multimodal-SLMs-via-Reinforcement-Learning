                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of bronchoalveolar carcinoma, presenting with worsening
 shortness of breath, othopnea, peripheral edema.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are decreased.   Increased
 lung base opacities likely reflect progression of multifocal bronchoalveolar
 carcinoma. There is substantial increase of bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is somewhat limited by overlying
 opacities.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter is in unchanged position. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased lung base opacities likely reflect progression of multifocal
 bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
 
 2. Substantial increase of small left and moderate right pleural effusions.
