                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent effusion  // initial eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is due to chronic
 paramediastinal location of right pleural effusion, overall moderate in volume
 and unchanged since ___. The moderate to large left pleural effusion is
 larger today than in ___, or is accompanied by new left lower lobe
 collapse. Left decubitus radiographs might be helpful in distinguishing
 between these 2 possibilities, but I expect CT scanning will be necessary.
 
 A 4 cm wide irregularly shaped radiopacity projecting over the anterior aspect
 of the right first rib is larger today than it was in ___, and conforms to
 the lesion visible on chest CT at that time. It should be considered a
 malignancy until proven otherwise. The first step in evaluation would be
 repeat CT scanning. Lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pulmonary edema.
 A right supraclavicular infusion port ends in the upper SVC. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 16:24 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider, Dr. ___,.
