                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with large type B aortic dissection with new O2
 requirement, pleural effusion L>R, LLL collapse of unclear etiology  //
 interval improvement in effusion/LLL collapse?     interval improvement in
 effusion/LLL collapse?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously collapsed left lower lobe has partially re-expanded, small
 bilateral pleural effusions are probably smaller today than on ___ and
 pulmonary vascular engorgement due to cardiac decompensation on ___ is no longer present. It is not possible to exclude pneumonia in the
 incompletely aerated left lower lobe, and is entirely possible that aspiration
 may have been responsible for the previous collapse.   Heart is normal size.
 Mediastinal contour including the mildly enlarged descending thoracic aorta is
 unchanged. Hyperinflation indicates considerable emphysema.
