                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ventricular tachycardia, hyperkalemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided ICD device is re- demonstrated with single lead terminating in the
 right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted.  Mediastinal contours
 are similar.  Previously demonstrated linear lucencies about the mediastinum
 are not visualized on the current exam, and no definite evidence for
 pneumomediastinum is present.  There is mild upper zone vascular
 redistribution without overt pulmonary edema, overall improved.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite findings suggestive of pneumomediastinum.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, improved from the prior study, with bibasilar atelectasis.
