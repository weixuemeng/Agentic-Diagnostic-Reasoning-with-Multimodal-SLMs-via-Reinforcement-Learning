 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are hazy bibasilar opacities on the frontal view which are thought to be
 technical and due to overlying soft tissues.  The lungs are clear without
 obvious consolidation, effusion, or edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the
 aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Lower thoracic intervertebral
 disc appears narrowed, potentially degenerative or congenital.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
