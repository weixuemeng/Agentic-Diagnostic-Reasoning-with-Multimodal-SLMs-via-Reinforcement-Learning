                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 patchy opacity projecting adjacent to the left ventricular apex on the frontal
 view, not well substantiated on the lateral view, is most likely artifactual,
 however, if the patient has site of pain projecting over the left lower
 hemithorax, an evolving consolidation cannot be excluded.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
