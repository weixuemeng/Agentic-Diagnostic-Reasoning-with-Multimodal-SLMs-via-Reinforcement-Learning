 EXAM:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall several days ago with pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine. There is minimal anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body, stable.  There are degenerative changes at the shoulder and
 acromioclavicular joints.  The humeral heads appear high riding, which can be
 seen in rotator cuff disease, as also seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
