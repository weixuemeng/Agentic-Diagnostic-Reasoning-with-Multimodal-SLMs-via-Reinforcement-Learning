                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right perihilar density, mild thrombocytopenia, evaluation for
 developing pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right perihilar opacity
 is almost unchanged in extent and appearance.  The opacity is rounded and
 adjacent to the minor fissure.  The opacity also cannot completely be
 differentiated against a structure of the right hilus.
 
 The differential diagnosis should not only include pneumonia, but also the
 possibility of a part solid neoplasm, potentially associated with right hilar
 adenopathy.  This finding should best be confirmed or excluded by CT.
 
 At the right lung base, mild peribronchial thickening persists.  The left lung
 is normal.  Bilateral apical thickening is symmetrical.  The presence of
 bilateral dorsal minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
