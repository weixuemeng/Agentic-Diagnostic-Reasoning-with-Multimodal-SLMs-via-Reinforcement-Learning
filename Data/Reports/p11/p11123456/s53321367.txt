 INDICATION:  Status post VATS right upper lobectomy, evaluation for interval
 change.

 expanded than on the previous image.  However, there still is a millimetric
 apical pneumothorax.  Moreover, mild post-operative parenchymal opacities are
 seen at the medial aspects of the lung bases.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged moderate tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  Unchanged normal appearance of the left lung.
