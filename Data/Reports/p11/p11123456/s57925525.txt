                                 FINAL REPORT
 Status post right VATS lobectomy.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube on the right
 has been removed.  There is a substantial air-fluid level that has newly
 occurred in the right apical lung (fluidopneumothorax).  There also is a
 substantial amount of intrafissural fluid.    
 
 On the left, the lung volume has increased, but there is a newly appeared
 small left pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
