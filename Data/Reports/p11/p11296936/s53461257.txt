                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been slight improvement in diffuse bilateral
 alveolar opacities following reported history of diuresis.  However, one area
 in the left perihilar region appears more confluent than on the prior study. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, have not appreciably
 changed.
