 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been some minimal interval improvement in the right-sided alveolar
 infiltrate. However there continues to be low lung volumes particularly in the
 lower lobes. An underlying infectious infiltrate in these regions cannot be
 excluded. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and alveolar edema
 bilaterally. The large bore dialysis catheter with tip in the right atrium/IVC
 is again seen
