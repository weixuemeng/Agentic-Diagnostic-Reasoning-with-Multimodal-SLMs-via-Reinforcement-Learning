                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and dizziness.  Evaluate for fluid overload or
 mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is
 redemonstration of streaky bilateral perihilar and lower lung opacities,
 consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Subsegmental
 bibasilar atelectasis is more prominent on the left.  There are probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.  Mild cardiac enlargement has not
 significantly changed allowing for differences in technique.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
 3.  Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis, as before.
