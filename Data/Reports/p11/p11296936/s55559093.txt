                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema and vascular congestion
 increased from the most recent prior study of ___.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  A small right pleural effusion is minimally increased. 
 There is no definite left pleural effusion.  Mild-to-moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is stable in comparison to prior studies.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased mild interstitial pulmonary edema/vascular congestion
 with stable small right pleural effusion are suggestive of fluid overload.
