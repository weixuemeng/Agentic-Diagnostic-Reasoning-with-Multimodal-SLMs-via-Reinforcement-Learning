                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  The diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are less
 prominent, though there is still evidence of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
