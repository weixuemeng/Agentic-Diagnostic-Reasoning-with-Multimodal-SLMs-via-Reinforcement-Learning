                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease with volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette, though the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
 have essentially cleared.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 again seen on the frontal view.
