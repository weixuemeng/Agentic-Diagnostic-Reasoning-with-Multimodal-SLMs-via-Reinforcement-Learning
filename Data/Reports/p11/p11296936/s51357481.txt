                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Bilateral diffuse airspace
 opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left have
 slightly worsened in the interval and likely represent progressive
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Superimposed pneumonia in the right lung is
 also a possibility, and followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in
 this regard.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged.
