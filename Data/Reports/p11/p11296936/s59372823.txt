                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been interval
 resolution of pulmonary edema.  Linear density along the minor fissure may
 represent residual fluid or scarring.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  No focal consolidation is seen, although lateral evaluation is slightly
 limited due to low lung volumes.  Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  A left-sided subclavian line is in similar
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of pulmonary edema with persistent borderline
 cardiomegaly.
