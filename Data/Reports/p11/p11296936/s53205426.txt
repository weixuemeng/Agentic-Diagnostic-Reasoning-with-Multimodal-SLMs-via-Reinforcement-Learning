                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral hazy interstitial opacities likely
 representative of moderate pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears enlarged in comparison to prior study.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion. Overall, these findings are representative of heart failure. 
 Furthermore, a focal 1.5 x 1.2 cm nodularity is noted in the right upper lobe.
 No acute fractures identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral hazy interstitial opacities with enlarged cardiomediastinal
 silhouette are representative of heart failure.  
 2.  1.5 x 1.2 cm nodularities in the right upper lobe.  Dedicated chest
 radiographs post-diuresis are recommended to evaluate this region.
