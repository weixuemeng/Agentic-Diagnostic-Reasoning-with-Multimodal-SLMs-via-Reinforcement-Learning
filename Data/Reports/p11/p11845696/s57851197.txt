                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Rounded density on prior chest radiograph,
 re-assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, the previously demonstrated rounded density is
 re-demonstrated and appears to be less prominent and potentially reflects a
 vascular structure since it is unchanged since ___.  Small
 amount of pleural effusion is noted as well as bibasal atelectasis, unchanged.
 Prominence of the main pulmonary artery might be consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Calcifications of the mitral
 annulus are noted.
