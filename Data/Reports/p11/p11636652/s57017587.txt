                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with HCV cirrhosis, AICD, cardiac arrest, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 4.8 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line is in upper SVC and
 NG tube in the stomach.  An atrioventricular pacemaker is in adequate
 position.  Bilateral ground-glass opacities have worsened since previous exam;
 it is heterogeneous and asymmetric, more prominent in the left perihilar
 region and in the periphery of right upper lower lobe.  Left lower lobe
 collapse has improved since previous exam.  Pleural effusions are small if any
 and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Bilateral heterogeneous ground-glass opacities have worsened since
 previous exam.  The differential diagnosis would include pulmonary edema or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.
