 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with desaturation on O2 and cough and upper
 extremity edema ___ brachiocephalic and SVC stenosis.  Please eval for

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  CT
 chest of ___.  MRV chest of the prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the most recent radiograph, left lower lobe opacity compatible
 with infection is grossly unchanged.  There is minimal right basilar
 atelectasis.  Lobulated contour abutting the aortic arch and projecting over
 the AP window is compatible with thoracic aortic aneurysm and prior
 dissection.  Intact median sternotomy wires.  No pneumothorax.  Tiny, if any,
 right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lobe consolidation, compatible with infection.  Small
 right pleural effusion.
