                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new A fib and probable CHF.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 4 hr prior to this exam. CT chest from

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior exam there has been significant interval improvement
 of bilateral pulmonary edema, although residual pulmonary edema is still
 significant. No focal opacity is seen in the left affected upper lungs. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate
 cardiomegaly stable. The first sternotomy wire is broken although not
 displaced and the remaining sternotomy wires are intact, similar to prior.

 Interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Underlying consolidation cannot be
 completely excluded given significant residual pulmonary edema nodular
 opacities.
