 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  PIC line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a tracheostomy in place.  An esophageal tube passes into
 the stomach, its inferior course not imaged.  A right subclavian dual-lumen
 catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  A right-sided PIC line also
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PIC line terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of
 acute disease.
