 to pulmonary edema rather than an infectious consolidation.  Mild improvement
 of pulmonary edema.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  The pleural surfaces are
 stable.  The NG tube is located near the esophagogastric junction.  The right
 IJ terminates in the lower SVC.

 1. The NG tube is located near the esophagogastric junction and would need to
 be advanced 15 cm for side ports to be within the gastric lumen.
 2. Slight improvement of pulmonary edema, particularly of the right lower
 lung.
