                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of interstitial lung disease
 (possible sarcoidosis on prior chest CT) and congestive heart failure, now
 presenting with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and CTA of the
 chest from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Re-demonstrated is unchanged
 moderate interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed upon patient's underlying
 chronic lung disease.  Overall increased density of the lung bases is likely
 secondary to attenuation artifact due to the patient's body habitus.  No
 confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain mildly enlarged, though unchanged
 from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
