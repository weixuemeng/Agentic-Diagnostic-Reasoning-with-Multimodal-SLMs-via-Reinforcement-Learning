                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and chest pain.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited due to poor positioning and underpenetration
 secondary to body habitus. Allowing for these limitations:
 
 There is no focal pulmonary opacity. The conspicuous interstitial pattern is
 felt to be related to superimposition of tissue due to patient's body habitus.
 The cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process in this limited
 examination.
