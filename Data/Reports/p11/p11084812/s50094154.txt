                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath,
 cardiomyopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 suboptimal due to underpenetration from patient body habitus.  Given this, the
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings bilaterally is most consistent with mild interstitial
 edema.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
