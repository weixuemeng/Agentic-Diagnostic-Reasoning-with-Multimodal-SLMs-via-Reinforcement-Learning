                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of tachycardia, history
 of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 previously seen left-sided PICC is no longer seen and likely removed in the
 interval.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  Haziness at the left lung
 base is likely due to overlying soft tissue.  There is mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen, although a retrocardiac consolidation
 would be difficult to exclude on this study.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
