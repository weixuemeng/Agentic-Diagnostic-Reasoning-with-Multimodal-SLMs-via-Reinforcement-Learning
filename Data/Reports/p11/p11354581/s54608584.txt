 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is subtle increased
 opacity in the left mid lung which projects in the retrosternal clear space on
 the lateral view.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax
 or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left mid lung opacity which could represent atelectasis
 although infection is possible in the proper clinical setting.
