 HISTORY:  Known right middle lobe metastatic disease, now with hypoxia and
 dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.

 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior chest radiograph, there is been a slight interval
 improvement in the right pleural effusion, as well as more significant
 improvement in the bibasilar atelectasis.  The known right middle lobe mass is
 now more conspicuous.  There is a stable, small left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis.  The upper lungs are clear without focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in the right lower lung pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis.  Stable, small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
