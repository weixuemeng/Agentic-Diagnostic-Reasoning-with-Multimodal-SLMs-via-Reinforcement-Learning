                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with new hypoxia.  Question pneumonia or pleural
 effusion or edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous moderate right pleural effusion is smaller, obscuring the mass at the
 base of the right lung.  Left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation is
 stable. One is tempted to explain the patient's signs and symptoms in terms of
 pneumonia, but if malignancy is extensive, pulmonary embolus becomes a
 reasonable alternate diagnosis.  Heart size is normal.  Upper lungs are clear.
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Gaseous distention of the intestinal tract is
 seen in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
