                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 similar without pulmonary vascular congestion.  Emphysema is again noted
 within the upper lobes.  New lobulated dense opacity with peripheral haziness
 medially is seen within the lateral aspect of the right lower hemi thorax, and
 appears pleural based.  Nodular opacities within both lungs are re-
 demonstrated, grossly unchanged compatible with known metastatic disease. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Clips are noted overlying the epigastric region.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval development of lobulated opacity in the lateral aspect of the
 right lower hemi thorax which is pleural based, and could be a loculated
 pleural effusion but hemothorax is not excluded.  Further assessment with
 chest CT is recommended.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and multiple nodules in both lungs
 compatible with metastatic disease are grossly unchanged.
