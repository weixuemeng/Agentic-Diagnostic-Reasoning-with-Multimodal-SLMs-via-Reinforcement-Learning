 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met pancreatic cancer to lung. R breath

 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, moderate multiloculated right
 pleural effusion has mildly improved, as well as adjacent right middle and

 hyperinflated with vascular deficiency in the upper lobes, consistent with
 emphysema, better assessed on prior chest CT.  There is no new focal
 consolidation concerning for mass or infection.  No central vascular
