                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // Please evaluate for infiltrate,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac borders, left hemidiaphragm, and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is interval elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with slight
 costophrenic angle blunting.  Posteriorly, overlying the spine, is a
 wedge-shaped increased opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Posterior opacification which could represent atelectasis although
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude in this clinical setting.
 2. Slight right costophrenic angle blunting likely represents pleural
 thickening versus small effusion.
