 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M suspected overdose, intubated/sedated with dropping sats, +
 bilateral BS
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   The endotracheal tube is
 unchanged in position with its tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carinal. 
 The orogastric tube tip remains in place in the left upper quadrant.  Mild
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis though difficult to exclude a
 component of aspiration.  Otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacities in the lower lungs likely atelectasis, difficult to exclude
 aspiration.  Overall no change.
