 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with non radiating chest pain and palpitations 
 // .      .
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparisonto  ___ at 13:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 05:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  The heart remains upper limits of normal in size.  There are
 streaky linear opacities at the left base favoring atelectasis.  A more patchy
 opacity at the right base also could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia
 or aspiration should also be considered.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
