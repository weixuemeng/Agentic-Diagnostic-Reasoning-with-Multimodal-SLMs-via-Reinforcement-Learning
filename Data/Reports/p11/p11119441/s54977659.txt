 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:52 PM
  The majority of the right lower lobe consolidation appears to have improved
  however there still subtle opacity which appears to localize to the posterior
  portion of the lung on the lateral film overlying the vertebral bodies.  Given
  this patient's neutropenic status, pneumonia is certainly possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Auto-SCT with febrile neutropenia, evaluate right lung consolidation
 from portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from ___ at 16:42 p.m. which raised
 question of an opacity in the right lower lung.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is better aeration at the right medial lung
 base, with only minimal strand-like opacity there.  No frank consolidation.
 Although possibility of an early infectious infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded, the appearance is definitely improved compared with the portable AP
 view.  No other focal infiltrate is identified.  No CHF, pneumothorax or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, not enlarged but with a
 left ventricular configuration.  Right subclavian catheter overlies the distal
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: Minimal strandlike opacity at right base, definitely improved
 compared with the film obtained earlier the same day. Please see comment
 above. No new infiltrate identified.
