                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with persistent cough and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is unchanged and within normal limits. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Minimal patchy opacity within the the lung bases could
 reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  Compression deformity of a
 mid thoracic vertebral body is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with minimal patchy opacity in both lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 Unchanged compression fracture in the mid thoracic spine.
