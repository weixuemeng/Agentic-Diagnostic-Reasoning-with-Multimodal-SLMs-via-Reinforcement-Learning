                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma with neutropenic fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Right IJ catheter tip is in low SVC.
 Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis, particularly along the right
 heart border.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Right lower lung opacity is indeterminate for
 consolidation and PA and lateral views would be needed to exclude pneumonia.
