                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 Cough, fatigue, fever, in a neutropenic patient with a history of multiple
 myeloma. Evaluate for acute process or interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which limit evaluation and results in bronchovascular crowding. However, even
 given these limitations, there are prominent reticulo-nodular interstitial
 abnormalities, which could represent pulmonary edema, infection, or a
 neoplastic process. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The right
 Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent reticulo-nodular opacities bilaterally, which may represent edema,
 infection, or a neoplastic process.  Clinical correlation is advised.
