                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for the past three days as well as right back pain. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia and/or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  There is an increase in the bronchovascular
 markings in both lower lungs, best appreciated on the frontal projection,
 likely secondary to bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart appears prominent on the
 frontal projection, although is suboptimally assessed given the low lung
 volumes.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bronchovascular markings in both lower lungs, likely
 related to bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 focal consolidation.
