                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is vague opacity obscuring the left
 cardiac margin, probably within the lingula.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear
 clear.  Old remodeled fractures involve the posterior lateral third through
 fifth ribs on the left only.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lingular opacity; differential considerations include
 atelectasis or potentially pneumonia.
