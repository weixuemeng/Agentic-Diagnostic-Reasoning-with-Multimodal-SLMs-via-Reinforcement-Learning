                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is vague opacity at the left lung
 base but very similar to prior findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity obscuring the left cardiac border; given chronicity this may be
 due to minor chronic scarring, although a recurrent infectious process is not
 excluded.
