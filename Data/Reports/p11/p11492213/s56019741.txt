 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post sternal debridement for sternal wound infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  The patient remains
 intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 9 cm above the carina,
 probably at the thoracic inlet and should be advanced by about 4 cm in order
 to obtain more optimal positioning.  An orogastric tube courses into the
 stomach.  Left subclavian and right internal jugular venous catheters appear
 unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Pulmonary edema has improved.  A pleural effusion is suspected to persist on
 the left and there is probably also a small right-sided pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  High-lying endotracheal tube; advancing the tube by about 4-5 cm may be
 appropriate since it terminates about 9 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Improving pulmonary edema.
