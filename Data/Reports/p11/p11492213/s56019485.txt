 consolidation persists in the left lower lobe, usually due to atelectasis, and
 partially responsible for the small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  A dual-channel
 right jugular and left subclavian catheters both end in the upper SVC and
 feeding and drainage tubes course through the esophagus below the diaphragm
 and out of view.
