                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wound infection status post intubation for wound debridement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 
 Compared with the prior study, multiple lines and tubes have been placed.  An
 ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  Right IJ central line is
 present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains prominent, with cardiomegaly, and is
 slightly less well-defined than on the prior exam.  Compared to the prior
 film, the sternotomy wires are not appreciated on the current study, raising
 the question of interval sternal surgery. Vertical linear lucency in the
 midline may reflect the surgical site.
 The prosthetic valve is again noted, essentially unchanged.  
 
 There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, which appears to have
 progressed compared with the prior study, with new obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is mild upper zone redistribution, with thickening of
 the minor fissure and mild vascular blurring, suggesting mild CHF.  There is
 minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  No gross effusion detected
 on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval surgery, with lines and tubes as described. Question interval
 removal of sternotomy wires. No pneumothorax detected.
    
 2) Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to prior, but the
 mediastinal contours are less well defined.
 
 3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse.
 
 4) Suspect mild CHF.
