                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder, unwitnessed seizure, chest strike.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Chronic pulmonary vascular engorgement is again seen.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture seen.  If high
 clinical concern for rib fracture, consider dedicated rib series, which is
 more sensitive.
