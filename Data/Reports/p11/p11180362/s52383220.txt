 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with crackles  // eval CHF, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 .  The patient is status post median sternotomy with wires intact. 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild edema.  Airspace opacification in the right lower lung is new.  An
 opacity in the left upper lobe is more confluent and increased in extent, now
 extending centrally to the left paramediastinal region and peripherally to the
 adjacent pleura where there is a loculated region of pleural fluid or pleural
 thickening.  Volume loss of the left upper lobe of is increased.  ICD remains
 in place with unchanged position of leads.  New small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, left greater than right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  A left upper lobe mass-like opacity is more confluent and increased in
 extent, concerning for progressive malignancy.
 
 2.  Right lower lung consolidation may reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration,
 or infection.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider CT for more comprehensive assessment of the left
 upper lobe neoplasm and right lower lobe process if warranted clinically.
