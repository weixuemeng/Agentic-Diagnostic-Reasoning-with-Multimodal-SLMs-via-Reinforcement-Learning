                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increased chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Widened AP
 diameter of the chest could be indicative of underlying COPD.  Heart and
 mediastinal contour appears normal.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the
 aortic knob noted.  The AP view is somewhat limited due to lordotic
 positioning.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs without definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.
