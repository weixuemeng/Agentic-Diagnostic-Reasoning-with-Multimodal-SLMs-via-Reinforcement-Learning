                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluation for pneumonia and
 congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The right lung is clear without focal opacity, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  In the left lung, there is no focal consolidation; however,
 linear opacities in the left lung base may represent atelectasis.  The left
 costophrenic angle is blunted which may represent a pleural scarring.  There
 is no pneumothorax in the left lung.  There is no free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may be due to scarring. Please refer to subsequent CT for further
 details.
