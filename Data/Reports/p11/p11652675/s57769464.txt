                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest CTA from ___.  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___ were also
 reviewed for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm margin which appears increased compared to ___ and is significantly worsened from ___.  Otherwise, there
 are no focal opacities.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No
 fractures are identified. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interval increase in blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely related to pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in this patient
 with SLE. Findings are better characterized on subsequent chest CT.
