                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 642
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress and ETT placement
 ? resolution of mucus plugging.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 642 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  Overall,
 left lung is grossly clear.  There is persistent opacity at the right base
 with an associated pleural effusion which could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia
 or aspiration.  Overall, it does not appear to be significantly changed. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on
 the current study.  The heart is stably enlarged.  Calcification of the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  Biapical pleural thickening, likely
 post-inflammatory in etiology.  No pneumothorax appreciated.  No pulmonary
 edema.
