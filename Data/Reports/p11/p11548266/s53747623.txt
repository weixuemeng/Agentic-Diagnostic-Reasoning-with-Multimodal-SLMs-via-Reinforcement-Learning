                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  Right basilar opacity is seen which may be due to partial
 right lower lobe collapse with possible small right pleural effusion.  No
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen in the left lung.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The previously questioned
 nodular opacity projecting anteriorly just above the hilar level on the
 lateral view is not well seen on the current study and may have been
 artifactual.
