                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  The report finalized under this clip number (clip ___) a few
 minutes ago, erroneously applies to a different chest x-ray examination, in
 particular to images obtained under (clip #___),  several hours after
 this study.  In fact, the  current film (clip ___) shows a hydro
 pneumothorax along the periphery of the left chest wall, which has
 subsequently been treated with a pigtail catheter, as seen on the later film. 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities and probable small bilateral effusions are
 more completely visualized on the chest CT obtained at 19:07 p.m..  An ET tube
 and NG tubes are nominal in position.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is
 noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hydropneumothorax s/p intubation  //
 increase in hydropneumo with positive pressure ventilation?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior film, a pigtail catheter has been placed, left chest and the
 previously seen left-sided pneumothorax is no longer visualized. Given the
 degree of subcutaneous emphysema and supine positioning, a small or anterior
 pneumothorax minor be apparent on this film.
 
 Chain sutures noted in the left upper zone medially.   There is patchy opacity
 in the left infrahilar and left lung base which appears more pronounced than
 on the prior study.  A platelike area of atelectasis has improved.  The left
 costophrenic angle is blunted, which could reflect some pleural fluid.
 
 Deformity of the of a left posterior posterolateral mid chest rib is
 compatible with prior surgery or trauma.  Subtle angulation of 2 ribs along
 the left lower chest raises a question of more recent fractures, the lesion on
 confirmed on any CT obtained approximately 3 hr earlier.
 
 Opacities at the right lung base are again seen, possibly slightly improved. 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small effusion.
 
 There is vascular plethora, compatible with CHF.
 
 The ET tube , NG tube and right IJ line are nominal  in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided pigtail catheter.  Previous left-sided
 pneumothorax no longer visualized.Given the degree of subcutaneous emphysema
 and supine positioning, a small or anterior pneumothorax minor be apparent on
 this film.
 
 Vascular plethora, compatible with CHF.
 
 Bibasilar opacities, compatible with pulmonary infiltrates and/or changes
 secondary to aspiration.  Small bilateral effusions.
