                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia, pneumothorax  // interval
 change      .  Review of prior imaging studies yields history of left lower
 lobe wedge resection and vats.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.0 cm
 above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip and sideport overlying the
 stomach.  A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying the distal SVC.  A
 pigtail catheter overlies the left lung.
 
 There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema about the chest, left-greater-than-
 right.  This obscures the presence of a subtle pneumothorax, particularly as
 the patient is supine and no lateral view is available.  Allowing for this, no
 gross pneumothorax is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 midline.
 
 There is hazy and somewhat patchy opacity at both lung bases and probably also
 a smaller area of faint patchy opacity in the right upper zone.  The right and
 question left cardiophrenic angles are obscured.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and minimal vascular plethora.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pigtail catheter in place.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  No gross
 pneumothorax,  but a subtle or anterior pneumothorax may not be apparent.
 
 Patchy opacities at both bases are compatible with pneumonic consolidation
 though atelectasis could be contributing to some degree.  Possible small right
 and equivocal small left effusion.
 
 Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, consistent with early
 CHF.
 
 Small patchy opacity in the right upper zone appears new or more pronounced
 compared with the film from 1 day earlier, question atelectasis, new focal
 infiltrate, or area of aspiration pneumonitis.  It could also represent an
 early area of more confluent CHF.
