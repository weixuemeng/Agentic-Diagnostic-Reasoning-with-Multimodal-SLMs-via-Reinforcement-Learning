                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Small cell carcinoma, rule out pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a complete middle lobe collapse.  In addition, there is abnormal
 enlargement of the right hilus, likely reflecting the known underlying
 disease.  On the current radiograph, no evidence of pleural effusion is seen,
 but the lateral left chest wall displays again an area of slight pleural
 thickening.  The heart is normal in size.  Known left-sided rib lesions.  No
 new parenchymal abnormality.
