                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w. LLL wedge resection c/b hydropneumothorax
 and pna s/p left sided chest removal  // Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent chest radiograph from earlier today, a left pleural catheter
 has been removed.  Left lung apex is partially obscured by external devices. 
 With this limitation in mind, a small left apical pneumothorax is not
 appreciably changed.  Exam is otherwise similar to the recent study except for
 removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
