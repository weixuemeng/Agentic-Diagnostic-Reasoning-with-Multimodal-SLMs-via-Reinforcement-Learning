                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute respiratory failure, PNA  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been considerable clearing of the
 previously seen right apical opacity, suggesting that it represented
 atelectasis.  The right base effusion is probably slightly larger.
 
 Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF, with small right-greater-than- left pleural effusions and
 underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  The presence of pneumonic
 infiltrate at the bases cannot be excluded.
 
 Left pigtail catheter, with extensive left-sided subcutaneous emphysema is
 again noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 ET tube the carina is not well delineated, but the ET tube probably lies
 between 2.9 and 4.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending
 beneath diaphragm, off film.  The sideport overlies the stomach.  Right IJ
 line is again seen, tip at cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with right-greater-than-left effusions and underlying bibasilar collapse
 and/or consolidation. The presence of pneumonic infiltrate at the bases cannot
 be excluded.
 
 Right apical opacity has improved considerably.  Right effusion is still
 small, but larger than on the prior film.
 
 Left pigtail catheter similar in configuration.  No pneumothorax detected.
