                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent lobectomy, now with fever, increased
 shortness of breath and cough. Assess for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT chest ___ from outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again demonstrated is extensive subcutaneous emphysema, more so within the
 left chest wall and neck compared to the right, as well as pneumomediastinum
 and a moderate size left basal lateral hydropneumothorax, all of which appear
 similar in size and extent compared with the most recent prior chest
 radiograph with the exception of the pneumomediastinum which appears improved.
 Heart size remains within normal limits.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with similar slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Chain sutures are seen within the
 left perihilar region compatible with history of prior wedge resection.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes re- demonstrated.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced in the interval, and may
 reflect aspiration or infection.  Scarring in the right hilus is unchanged. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are new in the interval, concerning
 for aspiration or infection.
 2. Interval improvement in extent of pneumomediastinum.  Similar degree of
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and moderate size left basal lateral hydro
 pneumothorax.
 3. Emphysema.
