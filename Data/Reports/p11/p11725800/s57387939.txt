                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of small cell lung cancer presenting with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are similar to the prior CT.  New
 right apical opacity is more suggestive of active infection than malignancy. 
 Areas of atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well
 as the right middle lobe appear similar to the prior examination.  Vague
 opacity is present in the lingula, although the latter is not necessarily
 changed. The chest appears hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Two substantial mid thoracic compression deformities appear
 unchanged.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Impression:  New right upper lobe opacity suggesting the possibility of active
 infection.  Post-obstructive pneumonitis could be considered in the setting of
 some recent concern for increasing right hilar malignancy.
