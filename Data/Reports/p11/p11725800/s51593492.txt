                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p LLL wedge resection with respiratory
 failure and PNA.  // chest tube assessment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, left pleural catheter
 remains in place, with a small left apical pneumothorax which in retrospect
 was also present on the prior study.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 improved aeration at both lung bases, left greater than right.
