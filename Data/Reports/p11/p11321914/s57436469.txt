                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with colon cancer, presents with chills and
 decreased breath sounds on the right assess for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam ___.  
 
 PROCEDURE:
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Port-A-Cath unchanged residing in the right chest wall with catheter tip
 extending to the cavoatrial junction.  The lung volumes are markedly low which
 limits the evaluation.  There is subtle bibasilar opacity which could
 represent pneumonia though given the low lung volumes, bronchovascular
 crowding atelectasis may also contribute to this appearance.  A tiny right
 effusion is likely present.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible vague opacities in the lower lungs could represent pneumonia. 
 Probable tiny right effusion.  Given the low lung volumes evaluation is
 limited.  Consider repeat study with improved inspiratory effort.
