                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with known pleural effusions and currently short
 of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes
 with continued bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the
 bases.  The hazy layering effusions make it difficult to assess for possible
 supervening pulmonary edema.  The Port-A-Cath remains in place.  The left
 subclavian PICC line has been pulled back slightly, so that it lies in the
 brachiocephalic vein.
