 As compared to ___ radiograph, nasogastric tube is been placed, with
 tip coursing below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable
 allowing for patient rotation.  Apparent worsening opacification in the right

 process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard
