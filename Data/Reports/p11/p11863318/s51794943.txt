                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of syncope, likely volume overload. Eval for
 COPD/consolidations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is an electronic device projecting over the left lower
 anterior chest.  A right internal jugular central line terminates in the right
 atrium.  The heart is again moderately enlarged, stable in size compared to
 the prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal fluid
 overload is suspected; however, this is similar to the prior radiograph. 
 Degenerative changes are again seen along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
