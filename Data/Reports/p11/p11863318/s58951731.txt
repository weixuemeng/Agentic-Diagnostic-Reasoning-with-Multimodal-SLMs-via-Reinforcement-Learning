                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  An electronic device projecting over the left lower anterior chest
 presumably lies outside of the patient.  A right internal jugular central
 venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The heart is again mild to
 moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal
 fluid overload is suspected, similar to slightly increased since the prior
 radiographs, but not substantial.  Moderate degenerative changes are similar
 along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight fluid overload, but not much, if at
 all, different than baseline.  Cardiomegaly.  Electronic device presumably
 lying outside of the patient.
