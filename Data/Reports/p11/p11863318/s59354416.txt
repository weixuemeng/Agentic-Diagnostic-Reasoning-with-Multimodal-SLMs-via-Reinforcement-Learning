                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette appears slightly decreased compared to the prior
 study and is within normal limits in size.  Interval improvement in pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No new focal areas of consolidation, or evidence of
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Assessment of retrosternal area on lateral
 view is limited by suboptimal positioning of the patient's arms related to the
 patient's inability to lift the arm in the setting of recent fracture. 
 Vascular catheter is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
