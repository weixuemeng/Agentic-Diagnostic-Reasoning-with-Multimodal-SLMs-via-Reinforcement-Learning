                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:41 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with question of pneumonia at an outside hospital
 earlier today.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Interpretation of the current pulmonary abnormality is difficult in the
 absence of prior films.  There is clearly a small amount of pleural effusion
 bilaterally, mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Beyond that
 the findings are of uncertain chronicity and specificity.  Distortion of upper
 lobe vasculature suggest emphysema.  Heavy interstitial abnormality at the
 lung bases could be dependent edema, pulmonary fibrosis, even aspiration or
 pneumonia, an indeterminate combination.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator noted.  No
 pneumothorax.
