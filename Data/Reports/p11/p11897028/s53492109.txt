                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with crackles right base  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Peripheral
 reticular opacities bilaterally and at the lung bases bilaterally suggest
 chronic lung disease.  No priors available for comparison, but no definite
 consolidation aside from what is felt to be chronic, to suggest acute
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely chronic lung disease, given lack of priors for comparison.
