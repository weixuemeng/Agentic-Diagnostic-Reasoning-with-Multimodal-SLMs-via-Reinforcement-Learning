                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, sputum, and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy appears unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 large consolidation involves posterior portions of the right lower lobe, most
 suggestive of lobar pneumonia.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive right lower lobe opacity suggesting lobar pneumonia. 
 However, follow-up radiographs are recommended within eight weeks in order to
 ensure resolution.
