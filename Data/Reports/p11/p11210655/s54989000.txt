                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with stroke  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large layering right pleural effusion and much smaller left
 effusion.  There is increasing consolidation within the right lung and to a
 much lesser extent in the left lung.  The perihilar and pulmonary vessels
 appear indistinct.  Findings together would favor asymmetric moderate
 pulmonary edema, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  The heart remains enlarged.  A
 dual lead pacemaker is seen with leads terminating over patient of the right
 atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing right pleural effusion and increasing opacities within both lungs,
 right greater than left.  Findings would favor asymmetric moderate pulmonary
 edema, although an acute infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
