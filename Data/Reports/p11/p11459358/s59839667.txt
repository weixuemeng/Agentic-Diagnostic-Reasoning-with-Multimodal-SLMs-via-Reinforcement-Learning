                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever  // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment. Allowing for low lung volumes and crowding of
 bronchovascular markings, no definite focal consolidation is seen. No large
 effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette likely within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to low lung volumes. No overt signs of pneumonia. If there is
 strong concern for acute process recommend repeat frontal view with more
 optimized inspiratory effort.
