                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs were acquired.  There is subtle
 increased heterogeneous opacity near the left costophrenic angle, projecting
 over the lower thoracic spine on the lateral radiographs, possibly atelectasis
 or though early pneumonia is not excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe minimal atelectasis versus early pneumonia. 
 Correlation with physical exam recommended.
