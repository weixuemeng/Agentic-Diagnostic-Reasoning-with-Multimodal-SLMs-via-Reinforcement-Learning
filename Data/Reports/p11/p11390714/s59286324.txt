                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  High fever and cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs appear
 clear bilaterally without definite signs of focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Given the slightly low lung volumes, evaluation is somewhat
 limited.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Clips in
 the right upper quadrant noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
