                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiac arrest intubated  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present. The carina is not well delineated, but the ET tube
 probably lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present,
 tip beneath diaphragm, overlying gastric fundus.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. Heart size is borderline enlarged. There is
 upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. Compared with the prior film,
 however, there is new increased retrocardiac density and new blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation. Some patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region is similar
 to the prior film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
