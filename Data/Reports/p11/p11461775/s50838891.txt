                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with current history of
 smoking and pleuritic right-sided chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Sternal wires are
 within normal limits.  Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs are hyperinflated, but
 essentially clear with no new pulmonary lesions demonstrated.  No appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, there are no findings to
 explain patient's symptoms.
 
 Note is made that this study neither confirm nor exclude the possibility of
 pulmonary embolism and if clinically warranted, correlation with dedicated CT
 angiography of the chest should be considered.
