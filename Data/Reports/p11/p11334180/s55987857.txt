                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Outside radiographs from earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Streaky basilar opacities, more confluent on the
 left than the right, are most consistent with atelectasis, increased since the
 prior study, although not widespread.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to exclude a trace pleural effusion,
 but there is no definite effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
