                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with fever and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates opacity projecting over the
 right lower lung, likely within the right middle lobe.  This is compatible
 with pneumonia, which could be related to aspiration.  Additional opacity
 chest lateral to the left heart border may reflect atelectasis versus an
 additional focus of aspiration pneumonia.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion and mild vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation likely in the right middle lobe, which may be related to
 aspiration pneumonia.  An additional opacity adjacent to the left heart border
 may reflect atelectasis versus an additional focus of aspiration pneumonia. 
 Small right pleural effusion and mild vascular congestion.
