                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral spontaneous subdural hematomas. 
 Evaluate for hilar adenopathy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal heart size.  The right hilum is normal and the left hilum is not well
 seen.  Convexity of the right upper mediastinal border may reflect mild azygos
 distension due to volume overload or an enlarged right lower paratracheal
 lymph node.  Lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left hilum is suboptimally evaluated on the current study.  Recommend
 conventional PA and lateral radiographs for further evaluation.
 2.  Convexity of the right upper mediastinal border may reflect mild azygos
 distension or an enlarged right lower paratracheal lymph node.  This would be
 better evaluated on conventional PA and lateral radiographs.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional PA and lateral radiographs.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ text
 ___ on ___ at 11:08, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings.
