                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, wheeze, poor historian
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and right-sided pacer placement
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Low lung
 volumes are present. Heart size is mildly enlarged and accentuated by the low
 lung volumes. Convexity at the right cardiophrenic angle could reflect a
 hiatal hernia. Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present with probable mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, potentially atelectasis.
 Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 2. Convexity at the right cardiophrenic angle could potentially reflect a
 small hiatal hernia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 PA and lateral views of the chest with improved inspiratory effort is
 recommended for further assessment of the lung bases.
