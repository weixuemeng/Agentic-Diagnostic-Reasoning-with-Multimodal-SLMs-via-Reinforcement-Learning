                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with failure to thrive and cough. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. Correlation is made to thyroid ultrasound from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Better seen in the lateral view there is a right
 lower lobe opacity at least in part due to pleural effusion. The left lung is
 clear. There is a large mass in the upper mediastinum,, larger on the right
 when compared to the left with associated narrowing of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet which is also displaced anteriorly.  Cardiac size is normal.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right greater than left upper mediastinal mass with mass effect on and
 apparent narrowing of the trachea, likely an enlarged thyroid, could be
 further assessed with CT.
 
 2. Small right effusion with possible associated consolidation.
