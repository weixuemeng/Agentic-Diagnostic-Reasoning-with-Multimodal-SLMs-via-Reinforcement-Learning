                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy due to
 esophageal cancer with hypoxemic respiratory distress, post-capsule endoscopy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained at 4:32 p.m.
 
 There is a dramatic increase in opacification of the left lung that could
 reflect most likely aspiration and less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Pulmonary hemorrhage is another possibility.  Right lower lobe consolidation
 has developed and might potentially reflect similar etiology.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted, small.  ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Esophageal capsule is projecting in similar
 location as on the prior study.
