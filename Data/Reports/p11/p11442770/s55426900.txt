                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with desaturation after capsule endoscopy
 placement.  Status post esophagectomy ___ years ago.  Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The heart is of top normal
 size, with stable mediastinal contours.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated
 and left lung volumes are low.  Increased opacity at the left base may be
 related to to resultant atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 Pulmonary edema seen on ___ has improved with decreased opacity
 in the right base.  A radiodense electronic device, compatible with a capsule
 endoscope, overlies the right heart border above the right hemidiaphragm. 
 This location correlates with history of esophagectomy.  No pneumothorax or
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left lung volume loss.  Increased ill-defined opacity at the left base is
 compatible with resultant atelectasis or, in the correct clinical setting,
 aspiration.
 2.  Improved pulmonary edema.
 3.  Capsule projects over the right heart border above the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on
 ___ at 16:40 p.m.
