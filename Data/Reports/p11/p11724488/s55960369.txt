                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper quadrant pain and crackles at the
 bases.  Question pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Opacity at the

 especially given appearance on the lateral.  Lungs are clear and costophrenic
 angles are sharp.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 Degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joints and hypertrophic
 changes are seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No focal consolidation.
