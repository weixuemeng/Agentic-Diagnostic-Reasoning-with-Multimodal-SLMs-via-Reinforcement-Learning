                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for 3 days.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  There are low lung volumes
 with associated bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen is an apparent nodular
 opacity in the right uper lobe, which appears to have slightly increased in
 size in the interval.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Slight interval increase in size of nodular opacity in the right upper
 lobe.  Lordotic chest radiographs are recommended to help determine if this
 represents a pulmonary nodule or a bone island.
 
 Updated findings were communicated via the ED ___ Nurses at 9:39 a.m. on
