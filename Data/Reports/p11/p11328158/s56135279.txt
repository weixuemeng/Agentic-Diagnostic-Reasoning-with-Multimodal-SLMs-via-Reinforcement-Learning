                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Extensive pulmonary fibrosis
 and bronchiectasis is grossly similar to the prior exams.  There is no
 suggestion of a new consolidation.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Enlargement of the aortic arch continues
 to deviate the calcified trachea rightward.  There is a large hiatal hernia. 
 Severe degenerative changes of the left shoulder are again seen.  The chest
 wall remains deformed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Grossly similar appearance of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
