                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Widespread heterogeneous
 combined alveolar and interstitial opacities are again demonstrated, with
 interval worsening in the left upper lobe.  Observed findings may reflect
 diffuse infection or edema superimposed upon known chronic interstitial lung
 disease, or could reflect acute exacerbation of ILD.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are again demonstrated as well as a hiatal hernia.
