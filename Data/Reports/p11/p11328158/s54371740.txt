                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___ and radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate diffuse
 reticular opacities, overall stable as compared to multiple prior exams
 allowing for technical differences.  Although subtle supervening infection on
 background pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis is difficult to exclude,
 there is no confluent consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 effusion.  The heart is top normal in size with multivessel coronary arterial
 disease.  There is atherosclerotic calcification within the aortic arch.  A
 large hiatal hernia is present.  Severe left shoulder osteoarthritis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute infection.  Overall stable
 background pulmonary fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis.  If there is
 clinical concern for subtle supervening infection, CT could be obtained.
