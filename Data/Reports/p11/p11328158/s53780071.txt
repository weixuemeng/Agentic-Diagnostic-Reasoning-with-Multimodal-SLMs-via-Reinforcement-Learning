                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and dyspnea.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, including
 most recent from ___ as well as CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable AP view of the chest demonstrates diffuse reticular and
 nodular opacities, not significantly changed since the prior study, and in
 keeping with a fibrotic chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is evidence
 of linear atelectasis within the right mid lung, as well as bibasilar
 atelectasis.  A small area of patchy opacification within the right lower
 lung, along the right hemidiaphragm, could represent atelectasis or pulmonary
 fibrosis alone, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified.  Known
 hiatal hernia is not as well appreciated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the right lower lung, could represent superimposed infection
 in the setting of fibrotic chronic interstitial lung disease.
