                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Widespread
 parenchymal opacities have slightly worsened since the most recent prior
 study, which again could reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and/or
 pneumonia superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval slight worsening of pulmonary edema or pneumonia superimposed on
 chronic lung disease.
