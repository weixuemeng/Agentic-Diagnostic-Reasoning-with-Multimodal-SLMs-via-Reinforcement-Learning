                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions in a patient status post
 abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed and compared
 to the prior study.  An endotracheal tube ends 8-9 cm above the carina and if
 advanced 2-3 cm would be in the proper location.  An upper enteric tube passes
 into the stomach and off of the radiograph.  A right internal jugular venous
 introduction sheath is visualized.  Right lower lung opacity represents
 platelike atelectasis.  Low lung volumes and a possible tiny left pleural
 effusion are unchanged.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are clearer on
 today's study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 8-9 cm above the carina and if advanced 2-3 cm
 would be in proper position.
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes and new right lower lung platelike
 atelectasis.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 11:28 a.m. at the time of discovery.
