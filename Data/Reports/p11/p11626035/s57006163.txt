                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Anoxic brain injury with increased secretions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy and
 Port-A-Cath remain in place.  The right lung is essentially clear with the
 previous atelectatic streak cleared.  On the left, there is some increased
 opacification at the base suggesting some volume loss and effusion.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
