                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy, now with thick secretions
 suctioned from the tube.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy catheter terminates at the
 level of the carina and should be re-adjusted.  A large caliber central venous
 catheter from a right approach terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There
 are low lung volumes bilaterally resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  An
 opacity within the left base may be a combination of atelectasis and effusion,
 though infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is evident.  There is no
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  A rounded density in the right glenoid may be a bone island.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar opacity, likely a combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis, though infection remains within the differential.
 
 2.  Low position of the tracheostomy tip at the carina.  Re-adjustment
 recommended.
 
 The above findings and recommendations were communicated to Dr. ___ at
 12:18 pm on ___ by telephone by Dr. ___.  The patient was
 already scheduled to have intraoperative replacement of the tracheostomy later
 in the same day.
