 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman presented by EMS after falling off the
 treadmill at her gym. CT on admission showed extensive SAH, IPH, with
 ventricular extension.  // s/p bronch - interval change/improvement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:06.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, increased since
 earlier in the day. Has been an increase in infrahilar consolidation in the
 left lower lobe, and although this could be atelectasis, the greater volume of
 ipsilateral pleural fluid raises concern for either pneumonia or pulmonary
 hemorrhage.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.
