 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube has been removed, revealing mild indentation of the lower cervical
 trachea.  This could be due to edema from recent intubation, prior stricture
 or enlargement of the lobes of the thyroid.  Followup advised.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but moderate left pleural effusion and
 mediastinal venous engorgement have increased and there is more atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  Left lower lobe is still substantially airless.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but pulmonary edema has not developed.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 The right pleural drain is still in place. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the
 region of the pulmonic valve.
