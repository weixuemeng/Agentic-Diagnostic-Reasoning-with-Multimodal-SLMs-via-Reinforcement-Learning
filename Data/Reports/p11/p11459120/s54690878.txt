                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is a moderate, somewhat
 increased interstitial abnormality suggesting mild congestive heart failure. 
 The lungs show no definite focal opacity, however.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion, although posterior costophrenic sulci are difficult to
 assess and are partly excluded.  Mild degenerative changes are present
 throughout the thoracic spine.  The bones are probably demineralized to some
 extent.  The patient is status post partly visualized left shoulder
 replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
