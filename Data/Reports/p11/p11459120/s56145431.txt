                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dypsnea  // acute cardiopulm disease
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing mild and subtle right
 upper lobe opacity has completely resolved. However, the lung volumes have
 decreased and today's examination shows minimal bilateral parenchymal
 opacities. Although these could be atelectatic in origin, the presence of
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 within normal borders.  No pleural effusions. Status post removal of the right
 PICC line.
