                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, now with bibasilar rales.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is a widespread interstitial abnormality, likely secondary to mild pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  Aortic
 calcifications are noted.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.  There is a left-sided pacemaker with
 right atrial and right ventricular leads.  There is also re-demonstration of
 left shoulder hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
