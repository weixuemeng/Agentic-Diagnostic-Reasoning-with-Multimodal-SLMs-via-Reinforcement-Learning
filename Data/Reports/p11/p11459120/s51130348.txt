                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Question infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a mild-to-moderate
 coarse interstitial abnormality which is very similar and suggests a baseline
 finding, perhaps due to chronic vascular congestion or airway inflammation,
 but without definite evidence for a superimposed process.  There is a vague
 patchy opacity in the left costophrenic sulcus suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
