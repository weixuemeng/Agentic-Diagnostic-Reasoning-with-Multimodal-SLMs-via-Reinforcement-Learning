                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intrascapular back pain, tender to palpation
 paraspinal region.  // Please evaluate for pneumonia, mediastinal changes to
 suggest intrathoracic cause of back pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal opacities in the right upper lobe have mostly resolved.  Background
 coarse lung markings appear unchanged and are suspected to represent airway
 inflammation or possibly vascular congestion, although vascular prominence has
 decreased substantially.  This appearance is unchanged but most striking in
 posterior lower lobes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The pacer is seen overlying the left
 anterior chest with intact leads in appropriate positions. Atherosclerotic
 calcification is seen in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked improvement in vascular congestion and focal right upper lobe
 opacities.  Persistent moderate interstitial abnormality.
