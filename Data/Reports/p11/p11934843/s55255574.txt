                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 minimal atherosclerotic calcification noted at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.
