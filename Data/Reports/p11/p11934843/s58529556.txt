                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with seizure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam which accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in the
 lung bases, potentially atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Infection cannot be completely excluded.
