                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intoxication, chest tightness and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits, and the
 heart size is normal.  Focal ill-defined opacities are demonstrated
 predominantly within the perihilar regions of both upper lobes, as was noted
 on the prior CT, but new when compared to the prior chest radiograph.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present, and there is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal opacities in both lungs, predominantly within a perihilar
 distribution, as demonstrated on the prior chest CT.  Findings again are
 nonspecific, but concerning for a multifocal infectious process.
