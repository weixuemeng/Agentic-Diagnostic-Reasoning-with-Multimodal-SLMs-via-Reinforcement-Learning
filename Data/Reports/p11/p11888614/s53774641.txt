                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and left chest wall tenderness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 slightly prominent, but stable.  Central pulmonary arteries are also mildly
 enlarged.  The pulmonary interstitium has a mildly coarsened appearance
 bilaterally, but without significant change.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvatures centered along the mid
 thoracic spine appear similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar central pulmonary artery enlargement, for which the
 possibility of pulmonary hypertension should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
