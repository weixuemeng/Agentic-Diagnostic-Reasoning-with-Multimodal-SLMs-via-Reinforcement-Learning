                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, status post seizure, assess tube
 position.
 
 FINDINGS: Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  There is an
 endotracheal tube which is seen terminating approximately 7.6 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube tip terminates in the left upper abdomen.  There is mild
 prominence of the bronchovascular markings which could reflect technique
 though possibility of aspiration is not excluded.  No definite pneumothorax or
 effusion is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  No bony
 deformities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Appropriately positioned ET and NG tubes.  Mild bronchovascular
 prominence could reflect an element of aspiration.
