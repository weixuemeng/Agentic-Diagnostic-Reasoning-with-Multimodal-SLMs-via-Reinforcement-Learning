                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Withdrawal seizure, flash pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the
 diaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Cardiac size is top
 normal.  Diffuse multifocal consolidations, larger in the lower lobes, have
 minimally improved on the right upper lobe.  This is consistent with
 multifocal pneumonia with improvement in the component with mild pulmonary
 edema.  There are no other acute interval changes.
