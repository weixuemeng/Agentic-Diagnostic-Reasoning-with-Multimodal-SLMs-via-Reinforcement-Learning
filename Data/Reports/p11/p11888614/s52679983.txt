                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for airway protection with fever, secretions.  Check ET
 tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  There
 appear to be two NG-type tubes.  However, these are difficult to assess as the
 left hemidiaphragm is excluded from the film.  They do extend beyond the edge
 of the film and likely do extend below the GE junction.  However, if NGT
 placement is of clinical concern, then a repeat film centered at diaphragms
 could be obtained at no additional charge to the patient.  
 
 Rotation limits assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette, but no definite
 cardiomediastinal enlargement is identified.  However, there is upper zone
 redistribution, with suggestion of vascular blurring and thickening of the
 minor fissure.  There are bibasilar opacities, with air bronchograms.  No
 gross right effusion; a left effusion would be difficult to exclude due to
 positioning.  There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) ET tube in satisfactory position approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  
 2) NG tubes not fully evaluated.
 3) Bibasilar opacities consistent with collapse and/or consolidation appear
 similar to ___ at 22:08 p.m., although the left costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.
