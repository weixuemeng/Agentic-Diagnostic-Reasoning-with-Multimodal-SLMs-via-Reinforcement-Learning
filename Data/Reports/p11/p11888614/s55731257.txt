                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, now intubated and increased secretions, rule out
 infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina at the level
 of the midclavicular heads.  An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm,
 extending to the inferior edge of the film, likely over the stomach/fundus. 
 The sideport lies in the region of the GE junction.  
 
 The patient is rotated.  There is cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution,
 with diffuse increased interstitial and alveolar opacities, consistent with
 CHF and pulmonary edema.  Probable small left effusion.  Underlying left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with interstitial and pulmonary edema and small left
 effusion.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Findings are
 significantly worse compared with ___ at 10:42 a.m.
