                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CTA of the
 chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been little interval change from the prior exam.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal without evidence of pulmonary edema.  Again
 noted are bilateral ill-defined hazy airspace opacities predominantly within a
 perihilar distribution, not significantly changed in extent compared to the
 recent chest radiograph and chest CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change in bilateral predominantly perihilar
 ill-defined airspace opacities which may reflect a multifocal infectious
 process, but is nonspecific.
