 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube has been
 removed. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen, consistent
 with substantial pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits on this study.  Given the extensive pulmonary changes, superimposed
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 The left spur PICC line extends only to the brachiocephalic vein just before
 the junction with the SVC.
