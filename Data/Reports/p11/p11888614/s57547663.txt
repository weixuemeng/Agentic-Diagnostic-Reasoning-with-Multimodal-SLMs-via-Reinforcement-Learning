 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, left arm tingling, assess pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 significant interval improvement in lung aeration.  Vague reticular opacities
 persist in the perihilar regions, possibly representing residual pneumonia. 
 No definite signs of CHF, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours appear normal.  Interval removal of the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant improvement in pulmonary aeration with persistent
 reticular perihilar markings, possibly representing residua of recent
 pulmonary infection.
