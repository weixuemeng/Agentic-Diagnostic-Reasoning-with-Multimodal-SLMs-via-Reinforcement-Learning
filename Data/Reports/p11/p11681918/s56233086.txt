 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M post left pigtail placement for pneumo  // Eval for
 decompression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube.  The moderate
 left pneumothorax and mild rightward mediastinal shift are unchanged in size
 from prior exam along with depression of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting a
 component of tension.  Large cavitary lesion in left lower lobe as well as
 complex cavitary disease in the left upper lobe with adjacent pleural
 thickening have been more fully characterized by a recent CT.  There is no
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with persistent moderate left
 pneumothorax with likely component of tension.
