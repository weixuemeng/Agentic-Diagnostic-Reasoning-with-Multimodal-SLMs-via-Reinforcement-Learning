                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, cough, recent pna  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to most recent chest x-ray the appearance of the left lower lobe
 consolidation appears slightly worse.  Left upper lobe bronchiectasis with
 scarring and volume loss is again noted.  Suggestion of a air-fluid level is
 best seen on the lateral view as on prior, potentially fluid with a large
 cystic cavity in the left lung.  Right apical scarring is also noted.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung base consolidation appears to have progressed since ___
 worrisome for continued infection.  Apparent air-fluid level which localizes
 to the region of large cavitation on prior CT scan, potentially with
 superimposed infection.
