 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and pain  // pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the recent prior chest CT from ___, there is
 increased opacity in the left lower lobe, particularly laterally.Large areas
 of cavitation seen in the prior CT were better assessed on CT although there
 is evidence of large lucency projecting over the left upper to mid hemithorax
 consistent with large cavity on CT.  Persistent left paratracheal prominence.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in opacity of the left lower lobe as compared to scout image
 from recent prior chest CT from ___, given differences in
 modality.  Evidence of left lung cavitation again seen, better assessed on CT.
