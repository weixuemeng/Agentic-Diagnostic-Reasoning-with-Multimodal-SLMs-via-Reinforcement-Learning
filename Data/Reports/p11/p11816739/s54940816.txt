                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis.  This is less
 pronounced than on ___.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged.  Prominence of the right hilum
 is similar to the prior study, with some patchy opacity in the right
 infrahilar region.
 
 There is minimal upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  The appearance
 is improved compared with the prior study.
 
 Again noted is a normal variant incomplete azygos fissure. The possibility of
 hazy density in the fissure cannot be entirely excluded, but I suspect this is
 an artifact due to overlying soft tissues.
 
 No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, including in the right infrahilar region.  The
 appearance is less pronounced than on ___.  No definite
 consolidation, though an early infiltrate would be difficult to exclude in
 this setting.
