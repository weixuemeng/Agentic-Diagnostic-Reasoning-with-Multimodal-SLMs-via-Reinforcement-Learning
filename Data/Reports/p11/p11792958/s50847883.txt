                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with a pacer device in place and some increasing
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Opacification at the left base is consistent
 with some combination of volume loss in the lower lobe, pleural effusion, and
 possible supervening pneumonia.
