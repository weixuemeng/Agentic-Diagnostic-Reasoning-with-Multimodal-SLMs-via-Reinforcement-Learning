                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but accompanying pulmonary
 vascular congestion has slightly improved, along with decrease in extent of
 interstitial edema.  A more confluent area of consolidation in the right upper
 lobe has worsened.  This could reflect an area of developing pneumonia
 possibly due to an aspiration event given previously provided history of
 aspiration.  Moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis are
 slightly improved, but a small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
