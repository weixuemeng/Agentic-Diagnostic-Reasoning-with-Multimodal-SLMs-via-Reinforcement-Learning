                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Possible aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal,  and hilar contours are stable.  There is again a
 moderate-to-large left-sided pleural effusion with presumed parenchymal
 opacification, probably attributable to atelectasis.  There is also a
 suspected small right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Compared to earlier radiographs of the same day, hazy opacification and
 vascular prominence seem similar to mildly decreased.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate vascular congestion, but similar to
 improved.  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with balanced mass effect. 
 This appearance could be seen with pleural effusion and coinciding
 atelectasis, although it is difficult to exclude aspiration as a potential
 cause for left basilar opacification.
