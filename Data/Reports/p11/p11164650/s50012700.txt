 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter remains in
 place.  There is suggestion of lucency and opacity in the right
 supraclavicular region, which may well relate to material outside the patient.
 There are slightly better lung volumes.  Central catheter again extends to the
 cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium.  Bibasilar opacification, more
 prominent on the left, is consistent with atelectatic changes and small
 pleural effusion.  No definite vascular congestion.
