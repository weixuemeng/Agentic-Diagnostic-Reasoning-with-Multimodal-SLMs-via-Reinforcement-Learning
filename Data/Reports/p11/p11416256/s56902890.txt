                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, heart and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Apparent elevation
 of left hemidiaphragm is likely in part due to a subpulmonic pleural effusion,
 moderate in size and apparently slightly increased since the previous exam. 
 Adjacent atelectasis or consolidation at the left lung base has slightly
 improved.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema
 are accompanied by a right pleural effusion.
