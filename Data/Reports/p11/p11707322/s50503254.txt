                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with Hodgkin's lymphoma, POC sluggish in
 flushing.  Study requested for evaluation of positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior port placement on ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right central venous access catheter terminates in the mid SVC. 
 Prior imaging taken during placement of port demonstrated tip in the right
 atrium, however, it is unclear if this represents the final positioning of the
 tip.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is
 persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Atelectasis at the left lung
 base has improved since ___.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC, prior
 imaging demonstrated tip in the right atrium, however it is unclear if this
 represents the final positioning of the tip. Clinical findings could be
 related to thrombus development in the right atrium or clot propagating along
 the catheter tip.  If further investigation is warranted, an ECHO or TEE could
 be performed.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 12:22 p.m., at time of discovery.
