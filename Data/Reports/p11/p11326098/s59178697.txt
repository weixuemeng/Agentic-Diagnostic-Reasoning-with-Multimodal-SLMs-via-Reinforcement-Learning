                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of
 normal in size.  There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the
 right base is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. 
 Less prominent atelectatic changes with smaller effusion is seen on the left. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
