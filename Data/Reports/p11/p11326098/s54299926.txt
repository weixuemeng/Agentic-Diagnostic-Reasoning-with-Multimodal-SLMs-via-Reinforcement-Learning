                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and effusions.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  The heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There is slight upper zone
 redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. 
 There is vague patchy opacity at the left base, improved,with corresponding
 relatively dense opacity in the left lower lobe.  There is atelectasis and/or
 consolidation at the right base, slightly improved.  No gross effusion
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lower lobe infiltrate, slightly improved.
 2.  Right base atelectasis and/or infiltrate also slightly improved.  
 3.  No gross effusion.
 4.  Probable background COPD.
