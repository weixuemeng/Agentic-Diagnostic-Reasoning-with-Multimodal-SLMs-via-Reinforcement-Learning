                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever with chills and low oxygen saturation at doctor's office
 with recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is top
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged with mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is present.  There is minimal streaky atelectasis at the lung bases.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild loss of
 height of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
