                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains severely enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. There
 is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 persists, and again raises concern for a subpulmonic effusion. Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Continued
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again raises concern for a subpulmonic
 effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.
