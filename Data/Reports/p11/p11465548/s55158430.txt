 INDICATION:   ___M with CHF, with CP, dyspnea on exertion  // ? pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As on prior, there is apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with the
 possibility of a subpulmonic effusion. Increased opacity at the adjacent right
 lung base has progressed since prior. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings
 seen throughout. There is no large left effusion. The cardiac silhouette is
 significantly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right lung base opacity potentially atelectasis given elevation the
 right hemidiaphragm versus infection. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with a
 configuration raising the possibility of a pericardial effusion. Mild
 pulmonary edema.
