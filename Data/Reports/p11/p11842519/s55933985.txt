                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with diastolic heart failure,
 pulmonary hypertension, on chronic oxygen with rales at right base and
 increasing oxygen requirements, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly as
 before.  Upper mediastinal structures are obscured by the presence of two
 ___ rods each with 4 penetrating fixation screws stabilizing the mid
 portion of the thoracic spine.  Integrity of orthopedic devices appears
 preserved and is unchanged.  Similar as on the previous examination, there is
 evidence of bilateral pleural effusion blunting the lateral pleural sinuses. 
 The pleural effusion is moderately more marked on the right side than the
 left.  Lateral view indicates extension of fluid into the posteriorly located
 dependent pleural sinuses.  No evidence of new acute discrete pulmonary
 infiltrates indicating acute pneumonia.  No pneumothorax seen in the apical
 area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral small pleural effusions and moderate congestive
 pulmonary vascular pattern.  In comparison with the next previous examination
 18 months ago, the patient's pulmonary congestion and pleural effusions were
 markedly more pronounced than they are now.  Whether the present degree of
 chronic CHF is related to fluid overload must be judged on clinical grounds.
