                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, hypoxic on room air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged, with the
 heart size appearing top normal.  There is mild pulmonary edema, minimally
 worse when compared to the prior study.  Moderate size right and small left
 pleural effusions are relatively unchanged.  There are patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities, likely reflective of atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Thoracic posterior
 spinal fusion hardware accomplished by two posterior rods and pedicle screws
 is unchanged.  There are multiple clips also demonstrated within the mid back.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure, with moderate size right and small left pleural
 effusion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not completely excluded.
