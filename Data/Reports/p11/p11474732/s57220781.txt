                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ___ edema  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise within normal limits.  Within the limits of plain film radiography,
 no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  The clavicular companion
 shadows are not well demarcated.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is
 identified.  Minimal degenerative narrowing and spurring in the mid thoracic
 spine is noted.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size at the upper limits of normal.  Allowing for this, no acute
 pulmonary process identified.  No CHF or pleural effusions.
 
 Non-visualization of the clavicular companion shadows (normal soft tissue
 contour along the superior edge of the clavicles).  While this may be an
 artifact due to overlying soft tissues, clinical correlation to exclude
 supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (which can be a source of nonvisualization of
 the companion shadow) is requested.
