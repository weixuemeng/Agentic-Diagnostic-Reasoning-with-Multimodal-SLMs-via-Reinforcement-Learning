                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope with head strike.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None at this time as the patient is listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overlying trauma board limits evaluation.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates
 approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip is within the
 stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mild
 widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and
 low lung volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  No displaced
 fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.
