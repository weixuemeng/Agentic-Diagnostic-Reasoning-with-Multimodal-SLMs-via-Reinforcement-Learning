                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, evaluation for abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 There is mild enlargement of the left hilus and a double contour, potentially
 explained by an atelectatic lung region.  In addition, a linear structure is
 seen projecting over the aortopulmonary window.  Overall, there is sufficient
 evidence to recommend CT, in order to clarify the findings in the region of
 the left hilus. 
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal.  No pleural effusions. 
 Otherwise normal lung parenchyma.  No pneumothorax.
 
 A note was added to the radiology dashboard for communication of important
 results.
