                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and scleroderma, to assess for fibrosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again increased
 interstitial markings at both bases.  This would be consistent with fibrosing
 NSIP related to the patient's scleroderma.
 
 There is a nodular opacification seen on the lateral view overlying the
 anterior aspect of the cardiac silhouette.  This appears to be somewhat larger
 than the previous examination.  This area should be evaluated on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial changes consistent with NSIP related to scleroderma.
 CT is strongly suggested to evaluate both the interstitial changes and a
 possible nodule overlying the heart at the base.
 
 This information was entered into the radiology dashboard.
