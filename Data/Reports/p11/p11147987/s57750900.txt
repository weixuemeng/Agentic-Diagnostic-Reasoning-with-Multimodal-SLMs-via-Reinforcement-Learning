                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Scleroderma, aspiration, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased.  The known bilateral subpleural reticulations, left more
 than right and clearly predominating in the lower lung zones, are unchanged in
 extent and severity.  The opacities are better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph.
 
 There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities, in particular none that
 would suggest pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 Status post sternotomy and cardiac surgery.  The sternal wires are in
 unchanged position.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
