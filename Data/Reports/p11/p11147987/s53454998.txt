                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post bypass surgery on
 ___.  Patient complains of rib pain when she breathes in.  Evaluate for
 pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is marked improvement of the previously
 existing bilateral pleural effusions that blunted the diaphragmatic contours
 completely and extended into the posterior dependent pleural sinuses
 bilaterally.  Diaphragmatic contours are now well demonstrated both in frontal
 and lateral views, thus there is no remaining evidence of pleural effusions. 
 Comparison is extended to the preoperative chest examination of ___,
 revealing that the patient had already evidence of advanced coronary
 calcifications and apparent stent placement in the right coronary artery. 
 Comparison demonstrates a mild postoperative increase of the heart size, but
 there is no evidence of remaining increased pulmonary congestion.  The patient
 had already on previous examinations evidence of chronic interstitial lung
 disease which apparently remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of previously existing bilateral postoperative pleural
 effusions, presently no pulmonary vascular congestion, unchanged appearance of
 previously existing interstitial fibrosis in this patient with history of
 scleroderma.
