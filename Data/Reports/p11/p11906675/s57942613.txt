                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  What was described as a right internal jugular catheter is instead
 tubing projecting over the chest, not a catheter.
 
 On review of this study, I see a possible ___ millimeter right lung nodule
 projecting over the anterior ___ interspace and 6th rib.  I have discussed
 with ___, my recommendation to repeat chest radiographs and shallow
 oblique views with nipple markers when the patient returns for his follow-up
 visit.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cabg POD 8  // eval for infiltrate     
 eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged since ___.  Lungs
 otherwise clear.  Heart size normal.  The right jugular catheter ends at the
 origin of the SVC, while a left PIC line ends in the mid to low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
 
 Lateral view shows a small retrosternal fluid collection at the level of the
 sternal angle. This is not uncommon following median sternotomy and does not
 warrant further evaluation unless the patient is symptomatic.
