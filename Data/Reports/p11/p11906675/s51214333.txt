 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mi, new o2 requirement. Assess for pulm
 edema, eval interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 bibasilar atelectasis and crowding of vasculature. Interval decrease in
 interstitial and alveolar markings. Increased small opacity obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal
 contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increase in small left lower lobe opacity is most consistent with
 atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 2.  Hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Interval resolution of vascular congestion.
