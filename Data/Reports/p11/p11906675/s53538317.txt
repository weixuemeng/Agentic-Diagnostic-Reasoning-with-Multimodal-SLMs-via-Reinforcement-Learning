                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF, CAD, now with new 5L o2
 requirement in setting of fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased prominence of the interstitium and hila is consistent with moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion which is new since 1 day prior.  Bibasilar
 opacities have slightly increased since one day prior which could represent
 alveolar pulmonary edema, however, infection could have a similar appearance. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema is new since 1 day prior.  In the appropriate clinical setting
 it would be difficult to exclude pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
