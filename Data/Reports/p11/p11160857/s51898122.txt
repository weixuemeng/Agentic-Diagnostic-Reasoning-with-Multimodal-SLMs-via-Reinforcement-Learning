                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A large
 hiatal hernia with large air-fluid level is again seen.  There is adjacent
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with
 the cardiac silhouette enlarged, likely in part due to underlying large hiatal
 hernia and thus the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed on this study.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although small pleural effusions are difficult
 to exclude.  No pneumothorax.
