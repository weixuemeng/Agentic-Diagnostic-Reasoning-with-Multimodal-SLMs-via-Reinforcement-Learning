                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic colon with dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are even lower lung
 volumes with some engorgement of the pulmonary vessels and prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar opacification, especially on the
 left, is consistent with volume loss and probably small effusions.
