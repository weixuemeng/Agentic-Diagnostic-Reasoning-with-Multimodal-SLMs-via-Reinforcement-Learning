                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright single portable chest view was read.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Central line through the right internal jugular approach ends at mid SVC.  The
 right hemidiaphragm is elevated secondary to collapse of the right lower lobe.
 Bulky right hilus, possibly from right hilar lesion leading to post
 obstructive collapse of right lower lobe could be a possible explanation.
 Moreover, presence of concurrent pneumonia in the right lower lobe cannot be
 ruled out. Left lung is clear.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Left hilum and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 CT of thorax is recommended for further evaluation.
