                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right hemithorax is opacified with volume loss.  The lateral
 view suggests a large mass, which is located posteriorly, probably in the left
 lower lobe.  There is probably a very small pleural effusion on the left. 
 Nodular opacities are widespread in the left lung, suggesting metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Volume loss and opacification of the right hemithorax. 
 Correlation with surgical history is recommended.  This appearance could be
 normal after prior pneumonectomy, but may reflect a large malignant pleural
 effusion otherwise with substantial atelectasis.  Widespread nodularity in the
 left lung is consistent with metastatic disease, but no recent comparison
 studies are available in our system.
