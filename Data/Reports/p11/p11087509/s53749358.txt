 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vascular clips denote prior surgery in the region of both lobes of the
 thyroid.
 Lungs remain quite low in volume.  There is new ground-glass opacification in
 the left midlung.  There is probably a widespread interstitial abnormality,
 responsible for low lung volumes and bronchial cuffing.  There may have been a
 similar, ground-glass abnormality at the lung bases on an abdomen CT performed
 on ___.  I would strongly recommend CT for characterization and
 followup.  Differential diagnosis includes desquamative interstitial pneumonia
 or drug reaction. There may be centimeter-sized nodules at the left apex, or
 this may be an external artifact if the patient is not fully disrobed, which
 will be evaluated by the CT scan. .
 
 
 Heart size is normal. There may be calcifications in the hila and pulmonary
 arteries appear mildly enlarged. There is no evidence of severe mediastinal
 adenopathy but enlarged central lymph nodes could be present
