                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with asthma exacerbation, intubated and
 increasing resistance  // r/o pneumothorax, interval change      r/o
 pneumothorax, interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes are in satisfactory position.  The patient has taken a
 better inspiration, which probably accounts for the difference in the
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette. There is again evidence of some
 pulmonary vascular congestion with layering effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.
