                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the right upper lobe is limited as the patient's chin and neck
 obscure this region.  Lung volumes are low. Mild cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta remains tortuous.
 Right subclavian central venous catheter has been removed.  There is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes, though there
 appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved compared to the
 prior study. No pleural effusion is identified, and no left-sided pneumothorax
 is seen.  Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures is compatible with renal
 osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Low lung volumes.
