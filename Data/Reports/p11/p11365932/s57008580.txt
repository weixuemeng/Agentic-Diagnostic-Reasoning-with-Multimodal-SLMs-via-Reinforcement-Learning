                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Right PICC hemodialysis catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___
 and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right hemodialysis catheter ends at cavoatrial junction.  The end of
 right-sided PICC line is obscured by the hemodialysis catheter, but is ending
 somewhere in the superior vena cava.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion has
 improved since ___ with also decrease in size of the right
 hilum.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 Decrease in size of right paracardiac Morgagni hernia from chest x-ray of
 ___ to ___ is probably explained by decreased fluid in
 the hernia due to change from peritoneal dialysis to hemodyalisis.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right hemodialysis catheter is in adequate position.  Right-sided PICC
 line distal end is obscured by the hemodialysis catheter, but is presumed to
 be in the superior vena cava.
 2.  Mild pulmonary congestion has improved.
