                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multiple but failed attempts for central venous line
 placement, assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Overall appearance of the vessels and the hilus is unchanged as
 compared to the prior study as described in detail in the prior report
 including the presence of mild vascular congestion, potentially mild pulmonary
 edema.
