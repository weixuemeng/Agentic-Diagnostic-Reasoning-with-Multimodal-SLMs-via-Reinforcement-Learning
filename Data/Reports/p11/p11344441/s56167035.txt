                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs show leftward rotation of the
 patient.  Moderate interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions
 are consistent with cardiac decompensation.  Left lower lobe consolidation is
 incompletely evaluated due to patient positioning.  Marked thoracic kyphosis
 results in increased AP diameter of the chest.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Aortic arch and mitral annular calcifications are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema representing cardiac decompensation.
