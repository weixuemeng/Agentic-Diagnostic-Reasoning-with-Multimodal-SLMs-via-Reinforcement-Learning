                                 FINAL REPORT
 RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is probably a hiatal hernia but
 not as well demonstrated on this examination.  There is similar background
 coarsening of lung markings, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Surgical
 clips project over the right upper quadrant.  
 
 There is moderate rightward convex curvature centered along the thoracolumbar
 junction.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild-to-moderate vertebral body
 height loss with a biconcave configuration along an upper lumbar vertebral
 body appears unchanged.  Bones are difficult to evaluate, however, owing to
 marked demineralization.  
 
 There is a lucency in the left scapula that probably represents an artifact or
 nutrient foramen.  However, dedicated radiographs could be considered if
 symptoms, if any, refer to this area.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Non-displaced lucency in the scapula neck, probably an artifact or
 nutrient foramen, although additional investigation could be considered if any
 symptoms or physical signs suggest the potential for trauma to the area.
