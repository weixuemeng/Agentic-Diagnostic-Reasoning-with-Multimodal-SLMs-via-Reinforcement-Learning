                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatic cancer, increased shortness of breath, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a
 relatively substantial right pleural effusion.  In addition, there are
 scattered focal parenchymal opacities throughout the entire right lung.  These
 changes were not present at the previous examination.  Some of these opacities
 appear rounded.  Overall, the changes are likely to reflect pneumonia,
 potentially combined to pulmonary metastatic disease.  In the left lung, there
 are areas of perihilar scarring but no clearly visible acute lung disease.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Unchanged moderate
 scoliosis, unchanged position of the left Port-A-Cath.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the referring physician, ___.
 ___, was paged for notification and the findings were discussed over
 the telephone at 10:35 a.m., on ___.
