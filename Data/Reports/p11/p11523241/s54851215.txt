                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-traumatic arrest.  Evaluate for injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest is somewhat limited by overlying
 trauma board.  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 3.3 cm above
 the carina.  Enteric tube terminates within the stomach.  Bilateral chest
 tubes are noted, both terminating in the mid low lungs.  The lucency at the
 right lung base is worrisome for residual pneumothorax.  Extensive right chest
 wall subcutaneous air is also noted.  There is no shift of the mediastinum. 
 The heart size is normal.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities could reflect
 either hemorrhage, aspiration or contusion.
 
 The patient had expired at the time of this dictation.
