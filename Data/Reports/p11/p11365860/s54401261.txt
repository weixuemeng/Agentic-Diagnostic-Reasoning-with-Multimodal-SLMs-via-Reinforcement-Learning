 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, increased since the
 remote prior study.  Otherwise, allowing for differences in technique, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is indistinct prominent central pulmonary
 vascularity including upper zone redistribution suggesting mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
