                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and wheezing, status post lobectomy last week.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Increased
 left basilar opacity has significantly increased likely large left pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Small left pneumothorax persists. 
 Prominence of the left hilum may relate to left-sided pleural fluid; however,
 underlying lymphadenopathy or consolidation is not excluded.  Left aspect of
 the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the left basilar
 consolidation; however, the remainder of the cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left hydropneumothorax.  Significant interval increase in left
 basilar opacity, likely left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.  Left perihilar opacity may relate to
 the above findings.  However, underlying lymphadenopathy or additional
 consolidation is not excluded.  Air-fluid level seen in the left upper
 hemithorax, which appears longer in the frontal view than on the lateral view
 can be seen in bronchopleural fistula.
