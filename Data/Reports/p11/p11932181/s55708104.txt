                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left lung mass status post bronchial biopsy.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dated ___, ___ and
 intraoperative radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates well-expanded,
 clear lungs.  There is a curvilinear structure in the upper left hemithorax
 which may represent the  pleural surface, but vessels are seen extending
 superior to this line, making pneumothorax unlikely.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion.  Again seen is
 a nodular opacity in the left upper lung, consistent with area of biopsy
 today.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left apical curvilinear structure may represent pleural surface,
 but vessels are seen coursing superior to this structure, making pneumothorax
 unlikely.
