                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, recent left upper lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post left upper lobectomy with significant volume loss again seen on
 the left with suggestion of interval increase in volume loss as compared to
 the prior study.  No definite pleural effusion is seen.  In the visualized
 left lower lung field, there is a patchy opacity likely present on the prior
 study and most likely relates to underlying volume loss, although a
 superimposed infection is not entirely excluded.  The right lung is clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.  Surgical clips in the upper quadrant are from
 presumed prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post left upper lobectomy with left-sided volume loss
 which is increased as compared to the prior study.
