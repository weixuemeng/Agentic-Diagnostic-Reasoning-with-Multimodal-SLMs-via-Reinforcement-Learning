                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left upper lobectomy with postoperative right upper lobe
 collapse and left apical pneumothorax.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph again demonstrate a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and a re-expanded right upper lobe with slight
 improvement of residual atelectasis adjacent to the fissure.  The left apical
 pneumothorax is likely unchanged.  Minimal increase may be secondary to
 changes in patient position.  There is no right pneumothorax.  Again seen are
 bilateral pleural effusions, the right effusion similar to slightly decreased
 and the left effusion increased.  There is no focal consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Likely unchanged small left apical pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion.  Unchanged to slightly decreased right
 pleural effusion. 
 
 3.  Redemonstration of a re-expanded right upper lobe with slight improvement
 of residual atelectasis adjacent to the fissure.
