                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CML  // Prior RSV pneumonia with increasing
 cough.   Assess for pneumonia.  Other abnormalities.     Prior RSV pneumonia
 with increasing cough.   Assess for pneumonia.  Other abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Previous generalized interstitial abnormality has largely if not entirely
 cleared since ___.  Peribronchial infiltration in the lower lobes, seen
 best on the lateral view, it is due to chronic bronchiectasis, unchanged since
 ___.  This could be the source of coughing, however the absence of
 radiographic evidence of active infection on conventional radiographs does not
 exclude abnormality that would be detected by chest CT scanning.
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Upper lobe pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests
 chronic borderline cardiac dysfunction.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pulmonary edema currently.
