                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is some hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting chronic
 pulmonary disease, but no evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.  No
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
