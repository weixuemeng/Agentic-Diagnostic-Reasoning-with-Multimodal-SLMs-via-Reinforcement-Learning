                                 FINAL REPORT
 FRONTAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube and ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 9 hours earlier.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  The tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 tip is out of view below the diaphragm, likely in the stomach.  New large area
 of opacities in the left lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration.  Right upper
 lobe opacities and opacities in the left perihilar region are unchanged. 
 There are no other acute interval changes.
