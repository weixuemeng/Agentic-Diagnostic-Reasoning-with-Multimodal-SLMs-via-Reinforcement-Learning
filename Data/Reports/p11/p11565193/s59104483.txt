                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CML with increasing white count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Faint opacities in the upper
 lobes bilaterally and in the right lower lobe are worrisome for pneumonia. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Probably increased from prior
 study, though comparison with CT of ___ is limited due to difference in
 technique.
