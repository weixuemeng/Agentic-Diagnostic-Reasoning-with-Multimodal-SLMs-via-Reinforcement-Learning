                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip terminates in the upper half of the esophagus.  Right PICC
 tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are hyperinflated. 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is minimal
 streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff tube tip terminates in the upper esophagus and needs to be
 advanced by at least 23 cm.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac patchy opacity could reflect atelectasis.
