                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with persistent leukocytosis and worsening
 retrocardiac opacity.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip seats 4.5 cm above the carina.  A
 right-sided PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  An endogastric
 tube courses inferiorly and out of the field of view.  An IVC filter is
 present.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear normal.  The lungs continue to demonstrate an ill-defined
 opacity behind the heart which does not appear to obscure the hemidiaphragm. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes in place as described above; retrocardiac opacity
 is improving but persists.
