                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with wheezing  // wheezing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality
 is more severe at the lung bases, with right infrahilar confluence.  Since
 pulmonary vasculature is engorged, the simplest explanation is pulmonary
 edema.  However it there is no dilatation of mediastinal veins or any pleural
 effusion.  I suggest careful follow-up to exclude a condition other than
 congestive heart failure, including interstitial pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable moderate pulmonary edema.  Careful imaging followup advised for
 detection of alternative diagnoses, including pneumonia.
 
 Chronic moderate cardiomegaly.
