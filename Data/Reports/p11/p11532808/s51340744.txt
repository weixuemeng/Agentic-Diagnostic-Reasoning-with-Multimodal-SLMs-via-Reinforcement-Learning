                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low, but have improved from the recent
 radiograph of one day earlier.  The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
 normal in size.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.  Improved bilateral
 interstitial opacities, which may have reflected interstitial edema.  Residual
 streaky peribronchiolar opacities are nonspecific, but could relate to the
 clinical diagnosis of RSV infection.
