 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 stable in size, and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 perihilar haziness as well as peribronchial cuffing and scattered bilateral
 interstitial opacities.  There are no definite pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with minimal interstitial edema.  Coexisting
 viral infection is possible, but there are no lobar areas of consolidation to
 suggest a bacterial pneumonia.
