                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough in a patient with history of non-Hodgkin's
 disease and graft-versus-host disease of the lung.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The central venous line tip terminates at the level of low SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable.  There is increased opacity in the lung bases,
 bilateral, nonspecific and may reflect infectious process or interstitial
 abnormalities.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Given the
 patient's history, correlation with chest CT is required to exclude the
 possibility of infectious symptoms versus worsening of graft-versus-host
 disease.
