                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with left-sided rib fractures related
 to motorcycle accident sustained on ___.  Evaluate rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view portable
 chest examination ___ ___.  Previously identified multiple left-sided
 displaced rib fractures as well as the surgically treated left-sided
 clavicular fracture appear all in unchanged  position.  The previously still
 present moderate-sized hydropneumothorax has disappeared and there is no
 evidence of any remaining pneumothorax in the apical area.  At the left base;
 however, there remain pleural thickenings, partially obscuring the
 diaphragmatic contour continuing in the lateral chest wall, which contains the
 multiple markedly displaced rib fractures.  There is no evidence of any
 remaining free fluid.  The posterior pleural sinuses are free on the lateral
 view convincingly identified, although the patient was unable to elevate her
 left arm.  No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Remaining chest wall depression in the left hemithorax related to
 multiple displaced rib fractures and clavicular injury.  Previously identified
 traumatic hydropneumothorax has disappeared.  Pleural scar formations remain
 at base.
