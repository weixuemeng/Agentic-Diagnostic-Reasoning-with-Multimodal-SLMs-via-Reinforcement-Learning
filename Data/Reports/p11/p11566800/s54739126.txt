                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:43 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a left hemopneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___
 
 Subsequent to screw and plate repair of the multi-fragment fracture of the
 left clavicle, there has been no pneumothorax, or increase in the extent of
 subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall extending from the axilla down
 to the upper abdomen and out of view.  Multiple displaced left rib fractures
 are still substantially displaced, not appreciably changed over the past
 several days.  Left lower lobe consolidation continues to worsen over the past
 several days.  This could be due to atelectasis alone, but pneumonia cannot be
 excluded radiographically.  Milder atelectasis at the right lung base is
 essentially stable.  There is no right pneumothorax.  Extent of
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion may have also increased since ___.  Apical pleural tube unchanged in position.  Mild thoracic scoliosis
 is stable since ___.
