                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left shoulder pain and with increased
 pain.  Study requested for evaluation of new injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Visualization of the pleural lines at the both lung apices is
 difficult. Apical pneumothoraces however do not appear appreciably larger.  A
 left-sided chest tube projects at the left apex.  Multiple left-sided rib
 fractures are unchanged.  Subcutaneous air along the left lateral chest wall
 and left neck region remain unchanged.  Left basal consolidation appears
 slightly increased today, likely related to increased pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Difficult visualization of pleural lines at the both lung apices,
 apical pneumothoraces however do not appear appreciably larger.
