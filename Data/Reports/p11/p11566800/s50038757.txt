 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after motor vehicle
 collision.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Substantial left scapular, rib and clavicular fracture is re-demonstrated. 
 Subcutaneous air is large and unchanged since the prior study.  Left chest
 tube is in place. Left basal consolidation is unchanged and there is slight
 interval development of right basal opacity that might reflect atelectasis,
 but infectious process is a possibility.  Also, there is a new right apical
 pneumothorax, not seen on the prior study, reason unclear.
