                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.5 cm from the carina.  Heart size appears
 borderline enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggest
 underlying emphysema.  Scarring within the lung apices is noted.  Streaky
 right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified although
 the left costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 
 2. Right basilar streaky opacity, possibly atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.
 
 3. Emphysema.
