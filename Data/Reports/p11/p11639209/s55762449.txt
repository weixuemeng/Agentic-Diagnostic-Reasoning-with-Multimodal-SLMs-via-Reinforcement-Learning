                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:53 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Laryngeal cancer after laryngectomy, an acute episode of respiratory
 distress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Both apical pleural margins are severely thickened, right greater than left. 
 Hila are elevated and therefore the likely explanation is scarring, perhaps
 due to prior radiation.  Lower lungs are grossly clear.  Heart size top
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
