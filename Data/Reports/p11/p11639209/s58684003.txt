                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory distress.  Question acute change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is background
 parenchymal scarring, also consistent with COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly. 
 The aorta is calcified.  There is borderline upper zone redistribution, but no
 overt CHF.  There is minimal linear atelectasis and/or scarring at the left
 lung base with minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  There is also
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is considerable
 biapical pleural scarring, with suggestion of some parenchymal scarring and
 possible slight retraction in the upper zones medially on both sides.  
 
 Of note, there is a focal 5.4-mm nodule in the right upper zone laterally,
 overlying the right fourth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suspect pronounced background COPD, with overall parenchymal scarring and
 also biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring, detailed above.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly. No CHF or focal infectious infiltrate identified.
 3.  5.4-mm nodule in right upper zone.  Further evaluation with chest CT scan
 would be indicated when the patient is stable.
