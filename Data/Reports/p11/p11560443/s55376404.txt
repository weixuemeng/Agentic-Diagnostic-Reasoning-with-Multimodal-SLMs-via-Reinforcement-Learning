                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right-sided pneumothorax after
 biopsy, check pneumothorax with chest tube on suction.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the frontal view of the next
 preceding chest examination obtained two hours earlier during the same day. 
 Chest tube is now on suction.  The volume of the basal right-sided
 pneumothorax cavity has markedly decreased indicating effective suction
 accomplished through the tube.  On this single AP chest view, there is no
 evidence of remaining pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinus. If the
 volume of the small pleural fluid residual as noted on the lateral view of the
 preceding examination has been changed can of course not be decided.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Effective suction reducing size of residual basal pneumothorax.
