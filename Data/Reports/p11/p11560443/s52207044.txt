                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right-sided pneumothorax, check
 for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view chest
 examination obtained three hours earlier during the same day.  Heart size and
 configuration unchanged.  The same holds for the previously described apical
 pleural thickenings and scar formations in the pulmonary parenchyma,
 significant upwards traction of the hilar structures.  The basal pneumothorax
 on the right side is unchanged as can be identified in comparison on the
 frontal views.  The amount of pleural effusion is minimal and presented by a
 mild blunting of the most dependent posterior pleural sinus.  A cluster of
 thin wired metallic structures on the right base is external and embedded in
 the chest wall soft tissue.  IT in contact with the meandering small caliber
 line that terminates within the local pneumothorax.
