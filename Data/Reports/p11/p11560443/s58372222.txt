                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest
 tube has been removed and there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  The degree
 of subcutaneous gas along the right chest wall may be slightly less.
