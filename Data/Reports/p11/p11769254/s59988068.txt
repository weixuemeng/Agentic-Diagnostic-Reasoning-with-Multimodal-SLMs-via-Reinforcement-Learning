                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new right effusion, status post
 thoracocentesis with ___ cc removed, evaluate for pneumothorax and residual
 fluid.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Our records do not include a previous chest examination that could
 be used for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 present.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable for age.  There is a sizable hiatal
 hernia in retrocardiac position surrounded by a few linear densities most
 likely representing compression atelectases.  This is more marked on the right
 side than the left.  There exists some mild blunting of the right lateral
 pleural sinus, but as both posterior pleural sinuses are free on the lateral
 view, there is no evidence of any remaining significant free fluid.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax exists in the apical area on either side.  Remarkable
 is, however, a nodular density in the right apical area medially and probably
 located in the anterior mediastinum but poorly delineated on the lateral view.
 In addition, there exists a few unexplained parenchymal densities in the right
 mid lung field probably in anterior position.  The described and not
 completely explained pulmonary abnormalities may have been diagnosed already
 on previous evaluation, but as they are not available for direct comparison,
 the performance of a chest CT might be indicated to better characterize the
 described abnormalities.
