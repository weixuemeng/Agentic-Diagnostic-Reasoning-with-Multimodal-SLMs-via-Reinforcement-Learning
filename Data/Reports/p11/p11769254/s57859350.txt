                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever on chemotherapy. Evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Better seen on a recent comparison chest CT, there are numerous soft tissue
 nodules throughout the lungs bilaterally, worse on the right, compatible with
 metastases. The largest of these is located adjacent to the right heart
 border, in the area of heterogeneous opacity on the current chest radiograph. 
 Increase opacity at the right lung base is in part due to known metastatic
 disease, however, superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude in
 light of the lack of recent prior chest radiographs.  The heart is normal in
 size and there is no pneumothorax.  Large hiatal hernia is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Numerous pulmonary metastases obscure the right lower lung field, and
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
