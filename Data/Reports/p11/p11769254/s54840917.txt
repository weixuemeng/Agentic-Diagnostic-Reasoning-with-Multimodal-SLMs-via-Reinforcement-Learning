                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer.  Previous thoracentesis; evaluate
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___, read in
 conjunction with intervening chest and PET/CTs on ___ and ___
 respectively.
 
 Large right pleural effusion has increased since ___.  Whether it has
 changed since ___ is hard to say given the differences in imaging
 parameters.  The larger pleural effusion obscures abnormal right lung along
 the heart visible on cross-sectional imaging.  There is no left pleural
 effusion, no pneumothorax.  Heart is displaced mildly to the left, but
 probably enlarged compared to the previous chest radiograph, although some
 distortion is due to a very large hiatal hernia containing more than the
 gastric fundus.
 
 The irregular right apical lung mass looks slightly larger today than two
 weeks ago, but this is not necessarily reliable.
