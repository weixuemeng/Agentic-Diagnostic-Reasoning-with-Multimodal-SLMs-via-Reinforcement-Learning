                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right apical pneumothorax
 has cleared.  The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.  Cardiac
 silhouette is essentially within normal limits and there is continued small
 right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectatic changes, more prominent on
 the right.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The subcutaneous
 gas has cleared.
 
 There is continued opacification in the right apex medially as well as
 overlying the area of the cartilage at the first rib on the right.  Prominence
 of the right hilar region persists.
