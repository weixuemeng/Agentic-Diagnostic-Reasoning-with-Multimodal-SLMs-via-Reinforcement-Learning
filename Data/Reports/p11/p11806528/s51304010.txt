                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCV cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic hydrothorax,
 continued desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, again seen is a moderately large right pleural
 effusion with extension into the minor fissure and underlying right lower lung
 collapse and/or consolidation.  The effusion is smaller than on ___, with
 some increased aeration seen in the right middle lobe.  Minimal atelectasis at
 the left base medially is again noted, similar to prior.  Doubt CHF.  No
 left-sided effusion is identified. The right-sided cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is obscured by the effusion, but otherwise appears grossly
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Moderately large right effusion with underlying right lung collapse and/or
 consolidation, but with slight improvement compared with ___.    
 2) Possible minimal patchy opacity at the left base is unchanged.
