                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with liver failure secondary to hepatitis-C presents
 with shortness of breath and abdominal distension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion is minimally increased in size compared to the
 prior exam. Right basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis. 
 The heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large right
 pleural effusion. Mediastinal contour where visualized appears unchanged with
 similar leftward shift of mediastinal structures. No pulmonary edema is seen. 
 The left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal increase in size of large right pleural effusion with right basilar
 opacity likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
