 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluation for mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates median sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal surgical clips.  The lung volumes are low with opacities
 probably attributable to bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no definite focal
 pneumonic consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
