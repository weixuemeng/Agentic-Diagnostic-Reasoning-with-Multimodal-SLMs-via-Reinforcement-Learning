                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are relatively well
 expanded.  The patient is rotated.  There is no focal consolidation or large
 pleural effusion though small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude
 particularly on the left given the patient's positioning.  Heart is normal in
 size with tortuous aortic contour. Retrocardiac opacity and prominent air
 column in the upper chest and neck may reflect distended esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Possible distended esophagus which
 could be evaluated with upper GI if indicated.
 
 Changes from the preliminary interpretation were emailed to the ED QA nurses
