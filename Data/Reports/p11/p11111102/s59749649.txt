 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the

 appearance of the heart and lungs. Continued elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with a configuration that could reflect subpulmonic effusion.

 opacification obscuring the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
