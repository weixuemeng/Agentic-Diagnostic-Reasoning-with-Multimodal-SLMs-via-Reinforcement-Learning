                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male post arrest status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supine portable AP single chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position.  An
 enteric tube descends along the expected course of the esophagus, terminating
 in the right upper quadrant.  A temperature probe is identified.  Lung windows
 demonstrates bilateral patchy ill-defined opacities which may reflect a
 component of aspiration or alternatively, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 contusions.  Patient is rotated.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours appear within normal limits.  No large pleural effusion is
 identified.  Allowing for suboptimal technique, no pneumothorax is identified.
 Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Status post endotracheal tube placement, in appropriate position.
 2.  Bilateral patchy opacities which may reflect a component of aspiration.
