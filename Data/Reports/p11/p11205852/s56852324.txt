                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CVA, intubated.  Please evaluate ET tube placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable exam of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS: The ET tube terminates approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  There
 is a right-sided IJ CV line which appears to terminate in the mid SVC.  There
 is apparent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, likely secondary
 to technique. There is diffuse mild pulmonary edema.  There is a consolidation
 at the right lung base likely secondary to atelectasis however aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  
 
 2.  Subtle consolidation at the right lung base is likely secondary to
 atelectasis however aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 
 3.  Diffuse mild bilateral pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion.
