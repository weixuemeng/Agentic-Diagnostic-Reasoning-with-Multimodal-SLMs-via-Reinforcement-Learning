                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with MCA infarct, intubated
 and currently with gram-negative rods in sputum, assessment for infection.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.3 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular line
 tip is at the superior SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Left
 more than right basal opacities are noted as well as mild vascular congestion
 and although no overall consolidation is seen, attention to the lung bases to
 exclude the possibility of developing pneumonia is required.  Note is made
 that the tip of the NG tube is not clearly seen.  Focussed radiograph with
 attention to the upper abdomen might be considered if clinically warranted.
