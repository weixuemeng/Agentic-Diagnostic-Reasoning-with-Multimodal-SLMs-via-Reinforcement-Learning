                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abdominal distention, prior pneumonia  //
 assess for partial SBO, r/o free air under diaphragm, and follow up on
 pneumonia from ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, left lower lobe
 consolidation has resolved.  Spiculated right apical nodule is unchanged since
 ___.  Biapical fibrotic changes, right greater than left, are unchanged.
 Hyperinflated lungs and upper lobe vascular deficiency suggest emphysema. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.
 
 Visualized bowel loops appear nondistended.  There is no pneumoperitoneum,
 though a true upright radiograph is much more sensitive for detection of
 intra-abdominal free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolved left lower lobe pneumonia.
