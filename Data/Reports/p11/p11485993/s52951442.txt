                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent hypotension and leukocytosis,
 evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 recent CT of the abdomen pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Areas of increased opacification overlying the right lung.  Could be
 postsurgical.  Not of typical appearance for pneumonia, however given the
 significant underlying architectural distortion of the right lung this may
 represent an infectious process in the proper clinical setting.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in irregular opacification of the right lung which may
 represent an infectious process superimposed on markedly abnormal underlying
 lung architecture in the proper clinical setting.
