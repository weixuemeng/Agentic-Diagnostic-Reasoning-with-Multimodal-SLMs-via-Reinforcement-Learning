                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a
 chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Areas of scarring
 in the right lung appear similar to those seen on prior CT from ___ as well
 as a chest radiograph from ___. There is right apical cap noted which could
 represent a small amount of right pleural fluid.  Alternatively, this may
 represent increased scarring in this region.  Overall, no significant change
 from prior.  The left lung remains clear.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged.
 The mediastinal contour appears normal.   The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of scarring in the right lung grossly unchanged from prior
 exam.  Slight increase in right apical opacity which could indicate small
 amount of effusion or pleural thickening.  Mild cardiomegaly also noted.
