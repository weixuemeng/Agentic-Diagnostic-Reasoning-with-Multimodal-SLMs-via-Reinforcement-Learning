                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  More obvious than on the
 previous image is a small left pleural effusion, despite positioning of a left
 chest tube.  There is atelectasis at the left lung bases.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema.  The atelectatic changes at the right lung
 bases are constant in appearance.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
