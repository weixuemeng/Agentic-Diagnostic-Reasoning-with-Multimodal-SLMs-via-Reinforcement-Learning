                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI, to assess for worsening edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued improvement
 in the pulmonary vascular status.  The right basilar atelectasis has
 essentially cleared.  Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobe and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle
 suggestive of small pleural effusion.
 
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
