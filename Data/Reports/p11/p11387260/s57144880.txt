                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ reference chest radiograph and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  A
 moderate left pleural effusion appears similar in size compared to the
 previous exam.  There is continued opacification of the left lung base, which
 could reflect compressive atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracolumbar
 spine with loss of height of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction
 which is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left pleural effusion, similar compared to the previous
 exam with persistent left basilar compressive atelectasis.  Infection is not
 completely excluded.
