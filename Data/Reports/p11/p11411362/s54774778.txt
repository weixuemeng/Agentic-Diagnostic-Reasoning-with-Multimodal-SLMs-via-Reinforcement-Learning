 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // Eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm above the carina.
 
 The heart is significantly enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  Bilateral airspace opacities seen predominantly at the
 bases likely represent mild to moderate pulmonary edema however infection
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There may be a small
 right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly enlarged heart with likely mild pulmonary edema and a small right
 pleural effusion.  Right basal opacity could also represent infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
