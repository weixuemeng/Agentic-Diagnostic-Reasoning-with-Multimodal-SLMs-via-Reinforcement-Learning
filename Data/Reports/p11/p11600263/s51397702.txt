                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent left pleural effusion.  Study is
 to assess for lung re-expansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an approximately 4-cm irregular central left hilar mass
 which is highly concerning for primary lung malignancy.  It is associated with
 post-obstructive collapse of the lingula and partial collapse of the left
 upper lobe.  Within the aerated portion of the left upper lung, there is a
 combined alveolar and interstitial pattern suggesting possible re-expansion
 edema or a post-obstructive pneumonia.   Underlying component of lymphangitic
 spread is difficult to exclude. There is a small quantity of residual pleural
 effusion seen on the left side.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted
 to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large central left hilar mass concerning for primary lung malignancy with
 postobstructive atelectasis.
 2.  Re-expansion edema vs. post-obstructive pneumonia in the left upper lung
 region.
 3.  Small residual left-sided effusion.
 4.  No pneumothorax.
 
 These findings were Dr. ___ at 3:05PM via phone by ___.
