                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV lung cancer with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ in correlation with PET-CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate top normal heart
 size.  Compared to the prior studies the mass in the left hilus and left mid
 lung is somewhat smaller and consolidated consistent with post radiation
 changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 osseous sclerotic lesions are similar to the prior PET-CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No pneumonia, no failure, no large pulmonary recurrence.  
 
 2. Detection of small nodules requires CT. 
 
 3. Diffuse osseous metastases.
