                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with newly diagnosed lung cancer
 status post left pleuroscopy, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view chest examination of ___.  The, on previous
 examination, identified left-sided chest tube has been removed.  The tip of
 the chest tube is still visible in the soft tissue of the lower left lateral
 chest wall, but it does not communicate with the pleural space anymore. 
 Comparison with the previous examination and the diffuse haze overshadowing
 the entire left hemithorax has cleared up suggesting the previously existing
 pleural densities such as pleural effusion have been eliminated.  Still there
 is evidence of a pulmonary parenchymal density on the left base and a moderate
 degree of mediastinal shift towards the left side can be identified in
 comparison with the previous portable examination.  This indicates a
 significant atelectatic component in the abnormality.  The right-sided
 hemithorax remains free from any significant pulmonary abnormalities.
