                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion followup.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 8:58 a.m.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, no significant change is detected.  Again seen
 is a catheter at the right lung base with a nodular opacity there, more
 completely evaluated on a CT from ___.  There is atelectasis in the right
 cardiophrenic region and at the left lung base, similar to the prior film. 
 Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with a small
 effusion, also similar to prior.  As before, there is evidence of volume loss
 with slight leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, though this is
 also accentuated by some rotation on current film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change compared with one day earlier. 
 No pneumothorax detected.
