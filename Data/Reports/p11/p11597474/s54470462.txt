 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been a mild interval decrease in right pleural effusion with a
 moderate right pleural effusion persisting.  A small left pleural effusion
 persists.  Otherwise, there is little change in comparison to prior study from
 the same day with multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic foci
 along with right hilar lymphadenopathy.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interval decrease in the moderate right pleural effusion.  Small left
 pleural effusion, pulmonary metastasis, and right hilar lymphadenopathy
 persist.
