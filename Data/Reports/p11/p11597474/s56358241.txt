                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion and
 increasing cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right pleural effusion appears to be slightly increased, large and
 loculated.  Left pleural effusion is most likely present, small.  Multiple
 pulmonary nodules are redemonstrated, overall unchanged in appearance since
 the prior study.  No definitive new consolidation is demonstrated to suggest
 interval development of infectious process.  The loculated anterior
 pneumothorax seen on the prior chest CT from ___, can still
 potentially be present on the current examination.
