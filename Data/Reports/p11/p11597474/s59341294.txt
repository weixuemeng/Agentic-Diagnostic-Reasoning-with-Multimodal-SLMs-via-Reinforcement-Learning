                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the large right pleural effusion.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 persists, consistent either with small effusion or pleural thickening.
 
 The diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases are again
 seen.
