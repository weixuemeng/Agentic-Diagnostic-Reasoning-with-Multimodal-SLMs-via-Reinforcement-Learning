                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion, needs evaluation.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 demonstrate clips about the bilateral hila.  Perihilar consolidation/scarring
 is present on the right and the hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated, likely
 reflecting components of post-resection and radiation changes.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Best seen on lateral view is pleural fluid tracking along the
 anterior and posterior pleural spaces on the right.  The degree of pleural
 effusion has decreased from prior PET-CT, but is more than on prior chest
 x-ray.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in right pleural effusion.
