                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is evidence of prior radiation change in the right hilum
 with continued right effusion and apparent substantial volume loss in the
 right lower lung.  Several nodular opacifications are again seen in the
 apices, consistent with findings on a previous chest CT.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
