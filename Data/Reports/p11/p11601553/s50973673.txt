                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAH, iatrogenic volume overload, and
 recent aspiration PNA, now with worsening tachypnea and desaturation on 4L. 
 // please evaluate for volume overload versus worsening infection.     please
 evaluate for volume overload versus worsening infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there again is substantial enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with worsening pulmonary edema.  Opacification at
 the left base again is consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume
 loss in the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
 Central catheter tip again extends to the lower SVC.
