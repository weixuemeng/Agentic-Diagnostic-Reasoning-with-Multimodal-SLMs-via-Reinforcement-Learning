                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe AS, not hypertensive and short of
 breath. Concern for acute pulm edema.  // eval for acute pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, diffuse interstitial
 opacities have worsened and likely represent progressive interstitial edema. 
 As mentioned previously, a more chronic basilar interstitial process this
 likely.  Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for more
 complete assessment following diuresis, at which time an asymmetrical opacity
 at the right apex may also be more fully assessed.
