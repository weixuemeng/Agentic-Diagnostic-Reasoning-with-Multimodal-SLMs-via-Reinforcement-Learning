                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with with chest pain  // rule out pna, eval for
 hardware
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Coarse interstitial opacities are present at both lung bases. 
 Asymmetrical area of increased opacity in right superior mediastinal region
 may reflect distended vessels accentuated by apical lordotic projection. 
 Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar interstitial opacities may represent a basilar distribution of
 interstitial edema.  However, the coarseness of the interstitial opacities
 raises the possibility of a coexisting more fibrotic lung disease.
 
 Asymmetrical opacity adjacent to right superior mediastinal contour as
 described.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:
 
 Recommend standard PA and lateral chest radiographs after diuresis for initial
 further evaluation of the above findings.
