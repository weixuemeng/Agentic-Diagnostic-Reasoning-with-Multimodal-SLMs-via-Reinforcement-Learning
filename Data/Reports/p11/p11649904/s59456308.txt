 There moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar opacities as well as vascular
 indistinctness. There are likely small pleural effusions bilaterally. The
 heart size is enlarged. Calcifications of aorta are noted.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pneumothorax.
 
 A chronic appearing deformity of the right clavicle involving
 resorption/resection of the distal aspect is noted along with severe
 degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, but cannot
 exclude infection.
