                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, multiple strokes, now with tachypnea.  Question fluid overload,
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for technical differences, there is
 little interval change.  Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD. Again seen is
 cardiomegaly, with CHF including interstitial edema, additional areas of more
 confluent alveolar edema, and small bilateral effusions. The degree of upper
 zone redistribution may be very slightly improved.   Opacity at the left base
 is slightly worse, with interval obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  A
 small right effusion and probable small left effusion are now seen.  
 
 Again noted is deformity of the left shoulder/scapula/humeral head and slight
 well-corticated truncation of the right clavicle. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema.  Slight interval worsening in
 terms of left base collapse and/or consolidation and small right greater than
 left effusions.  
 2) Possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
