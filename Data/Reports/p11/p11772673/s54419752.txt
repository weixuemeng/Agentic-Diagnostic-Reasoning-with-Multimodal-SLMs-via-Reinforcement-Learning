                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, head injury.  Evaluate for traumatic injury, pneumothorax, or
 rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  A shunt catheter
 is partially visualized along the right neck, right anterior chest wall and
 the right abdomen.  Lung volumes are low which accentuates normal heart size. 
 Normal mediastinal contours.  Bibasilar atelectasis with no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Very low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No displaced rib fracture;
 although, standard chest radiographs have low sensitivity for rib fracture.
