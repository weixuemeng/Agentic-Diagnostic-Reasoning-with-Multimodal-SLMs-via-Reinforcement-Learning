                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and shallow breathing since surgery on
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portal view of the chest of the patient in an upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are decreased lung volumes, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  The right hemidiaphragm is noted to be elevated
 with respect to the left. There is appearant volume loss of the right, medial
 lung base. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 frank pulmonary edema identified.  There appears to be mild cardiomegaly,
 although this may be exaggerated by the patient's low lung volumes and by the
 AP projection.  Mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Medial right lung base volume loss, likely representing atelectasis.
 
 2.  Elevated right-sided hemidiaphragm.
