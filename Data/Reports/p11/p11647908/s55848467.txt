                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of dyspnea, wheezing, history of asthma but no exacerbation
 in the past ___ years. Question pneumonia. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___
 and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiographs from ___, there is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Increased focal opacity at the right
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis as it has not significantly changed
 since prior examination from ___.  No focal abnormality to suggest
 pneumonia is identified.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Recent development of elevated right
 hemidiaphragm, could be secondary to diaphragmatic injury or phrenic palsy.
