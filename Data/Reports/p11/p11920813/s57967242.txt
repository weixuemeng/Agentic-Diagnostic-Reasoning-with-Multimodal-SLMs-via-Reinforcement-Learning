                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Worsening shortness of breath in a patient with AML.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction/proximal
 right atrium.  Lung volumes are low.  Diffuse reticular opacities in the lungs
 are demonstrated, slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.  They
 potentially might reflect interstitial process or widespread infection.  On
 the other hand, similar appearance of the CT chest from ___ has
 been demonstrated, though the findings might reflect chronic changes.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered.
