                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with perforated diverticulitis s/p SBR and ___'s,
 hypotensive in OR. On phenylephrine upon admission to TSICU with low UOP with
 pulmonary edema and effusion now on Lasix gtt  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, alveolar opacities in the
 upper and mid lungs have substantially worsened.  These findings are likely
 due to pulmonary edema although other secondary process such as aspiration or
 pneumonia is possible in the appropriate setting.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for slight improved aeration at both lung bases and persistence of
 a right pleural effusion.
