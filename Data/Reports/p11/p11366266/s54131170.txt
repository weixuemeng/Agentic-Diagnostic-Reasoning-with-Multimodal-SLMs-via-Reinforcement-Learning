                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with peritonitis, preop cxr  // preop cxr Surg:
 ___ (___'s )
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement or
 edema.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Small left retrocardiac opacity is
 most consistent with atelectasis.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Moderate calcification of the aortic knob.  Multiple dilated loops of bowel
 suggest ileus, though the bowel is incompletely evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Trace bilateral pleural effusions, new since 3 days ago.
 2. Mild left basilar atelectasis.
 3. Multiple dilated loops of bowel in a surgical patient suggest ileus.  If
 clinical concern persists, recommend abdominal radiograph for a more complete
 evaluation of the bowel.
