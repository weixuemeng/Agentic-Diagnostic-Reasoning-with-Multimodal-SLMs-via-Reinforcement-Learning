                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with perforated diverticulitis s/p SBR and ___'s,
 hypotensive in OR. On phenylephrine upon admission to ___ with low UOP with
 acute SOB  // interval worsening of pulm edema or effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, bilateral
 asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities demonstrate a mixed response,
 with overall worsening in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe, and
 improvement in the right upper and left lower lobes.  Such rapid fluctuations
 favor pulmonary edema as the most likely etiology although coexisting
 aspiration or pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size in the
 interval.  No other relevant change.
