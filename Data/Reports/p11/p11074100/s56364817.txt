                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known left upper lobe adenocarcinoma in
 ___, now status post left lower lobe resection after finding of a FDG-avid
 pulmonary nodule, with postop pneumothorax and placement of a chest tube to
 waterseal.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is clear with the exception of some discoid
 atelectasis in the lower lung fields.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax in the right. The patient is status post wedge
 resection of the left lower lobe. A chest tube is again noted ending in the
 left apex. A previously noted left sided pneumothorax has resolved in the
 interval, with loculated fluid occupying the space. The subcutaneous emphysema

 loculated pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no interval change compared with prior
 exam.
