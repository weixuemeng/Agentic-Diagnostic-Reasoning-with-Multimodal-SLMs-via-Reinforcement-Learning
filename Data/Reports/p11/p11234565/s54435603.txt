                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina, and
 nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  Interval decrease in width
 of cardiomediastinal contours accompanied by improved pulmonary vascular
 congestion and resolving edema.  Left pleural effusion has nearly resolved,
 and a right pleural effusion has substantially decreased as well.  There
 remains apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with adjacent increased
 opacity suggestive of atelectasis.
