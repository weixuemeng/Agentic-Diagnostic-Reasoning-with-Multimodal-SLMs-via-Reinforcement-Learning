                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Massive GIB.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:43 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, but is not well delineated.  It can be faintly seen extending
 beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  However, there is suggestion of a small
 sideport that overlies the mid/lower esophagus. Clinical correlation is
 requested.  A left IJ sheath is present, tip likely near the confluence of the
 IJ and left subclavian, with two kinks noted in the proximal portion of the
 sheath.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  There is
 obscuration of both hemidiaphragms, suggestive of bilateral
 right-greater-than-left layering effusions and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1) Compared with the prior film, the overall appearance is similar.  The CHF
 findings may be slightly worse.  
 
 2) NG tube poorly visualized.  Please see comment.
