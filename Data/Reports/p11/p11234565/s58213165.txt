                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed, status post TIPS, question acute lung process, cordis
 placement.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip lies approximately 4.9 cm above the carina.  
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears enlarged, and there is possible pulmonary vascular
 plethora.  There is also obscuration of both hemidiaphragms.  While this could
 be accounted for by low lung volumes, it raises the question of underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation and possible small effusions.  There is tubing
 overlying the neck, but no clear vascular lines are identified and clinical
 correlation is therefore requested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes, which may account for much of the appearance on this
 film of cardiomediastinal enlargement, vascular plethora and bibasilar
 opacity.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, CHF with bibasilar
 collapse and/or consolidation or effusions would be difficult to exclude on
 these films.
 
 3.  No definite vascular line.  Clinical correlation requested.
