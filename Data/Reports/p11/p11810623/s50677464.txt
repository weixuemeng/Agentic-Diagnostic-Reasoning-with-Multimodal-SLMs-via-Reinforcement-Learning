                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen,
 there are bibasilar opacities which may be due to chronic
 atelectasis/scarring, similar in appearance compared to prior.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, most likely representing
 scarring/atelectasis.
