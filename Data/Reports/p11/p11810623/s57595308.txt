                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are relatively stable with unfolded
 thoracic aorta and top to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Streaky
 opacities at the bases, right greater than left, most likely represent
 atelectasis although an infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary
 edema is seen.
