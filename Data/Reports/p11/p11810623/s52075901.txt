                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Leg edema, question pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Heart remains
 mildly enlarged though poorly assessed due to low lung volumes.  There are low
 lung opacities which could represent atelectasis.  Given the associated loss
 in lung volumes, early pneumonia is not excluded.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild cardiomegaly with bibasilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis, though cannot exclude an early pneumonia/aspiration.
