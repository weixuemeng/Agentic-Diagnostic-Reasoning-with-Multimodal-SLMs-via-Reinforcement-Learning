                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ disease and increased tremors.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including
 moderate tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  At both lung bases, but
 greater on the right than left, there are new opacities.  These could be seen
 with atelectasis but infection would also be a possibility to consider.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New basilar opacities, pneumonia versus atelectasis.
