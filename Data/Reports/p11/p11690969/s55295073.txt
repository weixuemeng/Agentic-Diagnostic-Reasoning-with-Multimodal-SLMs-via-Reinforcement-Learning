                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hyponatremia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valve again noted with
 mediastinal clips.  There is dense mitral annular calcification. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Lungs appear hyperinflated with
 flattened diaphragms suggesting COPD.  Subtle increased opacities in the
 medial aspect of both lung bases may reflect a very early pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Severe
 degenerative disease partially imaged at the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
