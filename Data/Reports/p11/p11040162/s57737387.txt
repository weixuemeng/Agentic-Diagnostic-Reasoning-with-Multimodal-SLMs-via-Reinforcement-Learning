                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cardiac arrest  // please eval for ards
 
 COMPARISON:  chest radiograph ___:21.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The mild generalized improvement in the asymmetric infiltrative abnormality of
 the lungs much worse on the right than the left suggests at least a component
 of pulmonary edema. Stomach is still severely distended. Endotracheal tube
 still ends less than 2 cm in the carina an should be withdrawn at least 2 cm.
 Heart is top-normal size, slightly larger than before. Pleural effusion is
 small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
 There may be a 14 mm wide right upper lobe nodule, partially obscured by edema
 or pneumonia on this and subsequent views. Conventional chest radiographs
 should be obtained when the acute radiographic abnormality has substantially
 cleared
