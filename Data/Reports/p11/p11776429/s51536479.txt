                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Stage III gastric cancer with hypotension and
 weakness.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to PET-CT
 from ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum appear unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence
 of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, masses or consolidations.  Minimal apical
 scarring on the right appears to be unchanged as compared to prior PET-CT.
