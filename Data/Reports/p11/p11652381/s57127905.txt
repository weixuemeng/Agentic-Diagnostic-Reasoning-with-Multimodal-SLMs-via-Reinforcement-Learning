                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Left sided chest tube  // r/o PTX left
 sided
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared to ___, a left-sided pigtail catheter has been placed. 
 There has been essentially complete clearing of the previously seen left
 effusion.  There is minimal underlying patchy opacity, possibly atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  The distribution and density of the opacity in
 the left upper/mid/lower zone is slightly different, but overall similar.
 
 Again seen is background hyperinflation/COPD, with extensive parenchymal
 scarring and extensive biapical pleural calcifications.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is partially obscured, but grossly unchanged.  No definite
 superimposed CHF is identified.
 
 The right costophrenic sulcus is grossly clear, without evidence of right
 pleural effusion.
 
 Again noted is severe sigmoid scoliosis and clips over the left neck.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of pigtail catheter with essentially complete radiographic
 clearing of the left effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Extensive opacity in the left lung, corresponding to the extensive airspace
 consolidation/abscess on the ___ CT scan is slightly different in
 appearance, but overall similar.
 
 Right middle lobe consolidation seen on the recent CT is not well visualized
 radiographically.
 
 Severe background COPD, with dense apical calcifications again noted.
