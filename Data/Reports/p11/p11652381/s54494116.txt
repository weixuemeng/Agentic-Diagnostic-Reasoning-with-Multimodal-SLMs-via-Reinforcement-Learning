                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain, evaluate for structural
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and left shoulder radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views the chest were provided.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 which could reflect underlying emphysema.  There is biapical pleural
 parenchymal scarring.  There is a severe levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine
 again noted.  Nipple shadows project over the lower lungs.  There is a
 calcified granuloma again seen projecting over the right upper lung.  New from
 prior, is a band like opacity in the left perihilar region with a central
 lucent ovoid focus.  Findings are indeterminate, possibly representing
 scarring though given that this is a new finding, a nonemergent CT is
 recommended to further assess.  The heart size is normal.  Tiny Coronary
 stents project over the left heart border.  The aorta is moderately calcified.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New band like perihilar opacity in the left mid lung, indeterminate, for which
 nonemergent CT chest is recommended to further assess.
