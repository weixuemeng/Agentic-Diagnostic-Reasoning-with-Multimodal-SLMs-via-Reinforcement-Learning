 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is extensive apical pleural calcifications bilaterally consistent
 with old tuberculous disease.  Opacification in the left mid lung
 corresponding with previously demonstrated pneumonia with abscess in the
 lingular lobe has now decreased and likely represents fibrous scarring and
 healing from the pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.

 Left midlung opacity likely represents scarring and healing of the lingular
 lobe necrotizing pneumonia
