                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New focal consolidative opacity is noted within the left upper lobe and
 lingula compatible with pneumonia.  Heart size is unchanged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aorta again noted.  Lungs are hyperinflated with chronic pleural
 calcifications noted at the apices.  Moderate left and trace right pleural
 effusions are noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes noted throughout the thoracic spine along with
 similar S-shaped scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New focal consolidation in the left upper lobe and lingula concerning for
 pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution of this finding.
 2. Moderate left and trace right pleural effusions.
