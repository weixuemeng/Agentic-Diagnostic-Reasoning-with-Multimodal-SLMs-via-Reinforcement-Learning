                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness and history of hiatal hernia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is again pleural effusion or
 thickening on the left side which is probably unchanged since the most recent
 study.  Mild spurring appears stable at each lung apex. Aside from minimal
 atelectasis at the left base, the lungs appear clear. Moderate S-shaped
 curvature to the thoracolumbar spine is again noted. Mild compression
 deformities are suspected but not well characterized at the thoracolumbar
 junction. The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large hiatal hernia.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No
 short-term change.
