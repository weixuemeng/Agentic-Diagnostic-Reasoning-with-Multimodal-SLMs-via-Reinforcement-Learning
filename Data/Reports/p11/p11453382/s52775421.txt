 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Findings are most consistent with a moderate pulmonary
 edema, which appears somewhat worse including perihilar opacities, indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature, and an interstitial abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema.
