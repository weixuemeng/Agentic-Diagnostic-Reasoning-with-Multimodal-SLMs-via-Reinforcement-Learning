                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent pneumonia, still with cough and
 wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded
 lungs that are generally clear with some slight atelectasis or fibrosis in the
 left lung base.  A sclerotic bone island is again seen in the lower thoracic
 vertebrae, best visualized on lateral images.  Persistent tracheal deviation
 is suggestive of a lower cervical mass which has been present at least since
 ___.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis/fibrotic changes at the left lung base. 
 Chronic tracheal deviation likely represents a cervical mass.
