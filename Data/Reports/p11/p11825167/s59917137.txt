                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest and back pain with shortness of breath. Evaluate for
 cardiomegaly, pneumonia or evidence for widened mediastinum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures
 and apparent prominence of the mediastinum. There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular congestion.
