                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Total aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.  Evaluate pacing
 wire in lung fields.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph ___ and cardiac CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right internal jugular transvenous pacer terminates in the right
 ventricle.  A CoreValve is present within the aortic valve.
 
 There are diffuse interstitial opacities consistent with plulmonary edema.  A
 more conlfuent area of opacification is noted in the right upper lobe.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.  More confluent opacity in the right upper lobe
 may reflect gravitational edema versus aspiration.
 2.  Satisfactory position of a right transvenous pacer.
