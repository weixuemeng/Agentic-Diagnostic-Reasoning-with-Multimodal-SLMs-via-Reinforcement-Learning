 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an aortic core valve and a cardiac pacer.  Moderate cardiomegaly is

 There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary vascular engorgement, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 pulmonary edema, however, the absence of pleural effusions and mediastinal
 venous engorgement raise the possibility of chronic interstitial lung disease.
