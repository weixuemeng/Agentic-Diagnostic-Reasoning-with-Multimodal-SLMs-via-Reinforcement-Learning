                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the previous pacer lead from
 the right IJ region has been removed and replaced with a left subclavian pacer
 that extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains somewhat enlarged but there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.  No pneumothorax
 following the procedure.
