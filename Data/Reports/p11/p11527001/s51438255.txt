                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with intracerebral hemorrhage, will
 receive four units of fluid, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day with patient in
 supine position.  Again, there is significant cardiac enlargement in this
 patient with a permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position and a single
 intracavitary electrode terminating in a position compatible with apical
 portion of right ventricle.  There is significant cardiac enlargement as
 before.  The configuration includes a prominence of the left atrial appendage
 contour resulting in a straightening of the left heart border rather typical
 for left atrial enlargement.  Pulmonary vasculature is still congested but
 less so than on the preceding supine examination.  On this image obtained with
 patient in upright position, there is no evidence of significant pleural
 effusion accumulating in the lateral pleural sinuses.  No new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates can be seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute stroke.  Cardiac enlargement
 including prominence of left atrial contours suggestive of mitral valve
 disease.  An echocardiographic examination is recommended.
