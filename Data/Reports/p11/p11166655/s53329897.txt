                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.
 Widened appearance of the superior mediastinum may be related to low lung
 volumes.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly, however this may be exaggerated due to technique
 and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Widened mediastinum which may be secondary to low lung volumes and repeat
 PA and lateral views with improved inspiration may be helpful for further
 assessment.
