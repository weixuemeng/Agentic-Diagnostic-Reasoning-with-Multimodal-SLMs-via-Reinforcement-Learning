                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube after last one dislodged/vomited out.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach, in appropriate position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are minimal opacities in the
 right lower lobe, could be atelectasis, but superimposed infection/aspiration
 cannot be excluded and attention on followup studies is recommended.  ET tube
 is in standard position.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
