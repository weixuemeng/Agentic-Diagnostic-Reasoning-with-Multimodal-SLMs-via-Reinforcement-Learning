                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fatigue.  Patient with history of
 metastatic melanoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ as well as CT chest dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a 6.4 cm biopsy proven
 metastatic melanoma lung nodule which when compared to prior study dated ___ is increased in size and relative to CT chest dated ___ is additionally increased in size, previously 5.6 cm on most recent
 study.  Additional opacity projects over the left mid to upper lung overlying
 the left posterior sixth rib in a similar location to prior peripheral nodular
 opacities on prior chest CT. No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia is
 identified. There is likely atelectasis at the left lung base.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right chest port is identified, its tip
 terminating within the inferior superior vena cava. No air is identified under
 the hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enlarging left lower pole biopsy proven metastatic melanoma nodule.  Interval
 enlargement of opacities in left mid to upper lung in a similar location to
 prior clustered nodules on prior CT. While infection is possible, underlying
 metastatic lesions are not excluded. No new focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia.
