                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with acute cholecystitis, CHF;
 question pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 large left retrocardiac opacity with areas of lucency which could represent a
 very large hiatal hernia, possibly containing bowel, not well evaluated on
 this study.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged; however, this likely in part
 relates to the hernia.  Right lung is clear.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large retrocardiac left mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity with
 areas of lucency with appearance of bowel and possibly stomach, likely related
 to large hernia possibly containing bowel, not well evaluated on this study,
 no priors for comparison.  Minimal right base atelectasis.
