                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hx AML, breast ca in remission now w/ likely R lung ca
 and lobe collapse per ?? PCP and___ w/u
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate a right middle lobe opacity which
 silhouettes the right heart border. There is mild downward displacement of the
 minor fissure suggestive of atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The remaining lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There has been removal of the left-sided
 central venous line since the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe consolidation with subtle loss of volume most compatible
 with right middle lobe partial collapse.
