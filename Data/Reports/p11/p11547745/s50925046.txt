                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 heart size.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Comparison can be made with a preceding similar study dated ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  There is
 a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and
 posteriorly but no significant enlargement of the left atrium can be
 identified.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows
 some calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  No local
 aortic contour abnormalities identified.  Pulmonary vasculature shows a mild
 upper zone redistribution pattern but there is no evidence of interstitial
 edema or marked perivascular haze on the bases.  The lower areas have more the
 appearance of hyper-aeration.  The right-sided diaphragm is scalloping in
 appearance with mild elevation in the anterior third on the right side.  There
 is, however, no evidence of any acute pleural effusion as the lateral pleural
 sinuses remain free.  No new acute discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates
 can be identified.  There are few linear peripheral interstitial densities
 bilaterally contributing to the general impression that the patient has a
 rather prominent COPD.  When comparison is made with the preceding similar
 chest examination of ___ it can be stated that the cardiac size has not
 increased significantly.  On the other hand, the general widening of the
 thoracic aorta is more marked than before.  Acute pulmonary CHF signs are not
 present.
 
 As already seen on previous examination, the patient has orthopedic hardware
 in the upper lumbar spine region.
