 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post dual-chamber pacemaker, confirm lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 dual-chamber pacemaker.  The generator is located in the left pectoral
 position, the course of leads is unremarkable.  One of the leads is located in
 the right atrium, the other lead is located in the right ventricle.  The leads
 are intact.  There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 A preexisting calcification in the soft tissues of the right subclavian region
 is unchanged.  Extensive pleural calcifications are also unchanged.  A
 preexisting opacity in the right upper lobe has resolved in the interval. 
 There is minimal pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.  Marked tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.
