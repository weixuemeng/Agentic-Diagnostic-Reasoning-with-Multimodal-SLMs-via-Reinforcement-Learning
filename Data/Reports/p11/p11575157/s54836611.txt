                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  There is
 lucency of the upper lungs with splaying of the vasculature, consistent with
 emphysema.  Streaky linear opacities within both lower lobes are not
 significantly changed in appearance compared to the prior study from ___, thought to represent subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  No definite pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
