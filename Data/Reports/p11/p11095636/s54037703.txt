 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in extent of the known left pleural effusion.  Pre-existing minimal right
 pleural effusion has resolved.  Also resolved are some areas of right basal
 atelectasis.  The right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. 
 Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.  Unchanged clips projecting over the
 heart and left hilar regions.  The appearance of the lung parenchyma is
 without indication for acute parenchymal changes.
