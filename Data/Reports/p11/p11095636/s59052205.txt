 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices except the right venous introduction sheath have been removed.  Lung
 volumes have decreased, mid areas of atelectasis and minimal pleural effusions
 bilaterally have developed.  No other lung parenchymal changes, in particular
 no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 normal alignment of the sternal wires.
