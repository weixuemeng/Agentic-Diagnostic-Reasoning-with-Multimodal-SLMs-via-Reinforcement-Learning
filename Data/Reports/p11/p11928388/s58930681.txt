  1. Significantly increased opacity of the left hemithorax, which could be
  secondary to patient positioning, with more superimposed soft tissue over the
  left hemithorax than the right. Other considerations would be consolidation,
  asymmetric edema, or increased pleural effusion.
  2. Apparent rightward shift of the mediastinum is likely related to patient
  rotation rather than mass effect.
  
  Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at ___ on ___, approximately ___ min after review. Per this discussion, a repeat
  chest radiograph can be obtained if there concerning findings on physical
  exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PE s/p STEMI  // assess for interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient is markedly
 rotated towards the right, limiting assessment of cardiomediastinal contours.
 Asymmetrical opacification in the left hemi thorax could be related to the
 effect of rotation and overlying breast tissue, but repeat, nonrotated
 radiograph would be helpful to exclude an acute parenchymal and/or pleural
 process.  Exam is otherwise unchanged.
