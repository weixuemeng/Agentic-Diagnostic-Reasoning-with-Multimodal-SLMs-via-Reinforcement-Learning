                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with STEMI s/p stent now with HIT  // assess
 for interval change      assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again
 there are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 heart. Bibasilar opacifications probably reflect atelectasis and effusion,
 though on CT some of this could represent infarcted lung. In the right upper
 zone medially, there is opacification seen on CT to represent either pulmonary
 contusion or aspiration or infection. Monitoring support devices are
 unchanged.
 Some displacement of the cervical trachea to the left suggests thyroid
 enlargement.
