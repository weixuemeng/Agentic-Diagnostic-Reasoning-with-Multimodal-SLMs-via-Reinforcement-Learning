 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with STEMI, intubated.  // evaluate prior to
 trial extubation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low but the
 radiolucency of the lung has increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation.  Decrease in extent and severity of a pre-existing retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  Otherwise the radiograph is unchanged, mild fluid overload but
 no overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia or larger pleural
 effusions. The monitoring and support devices continue to be in correct
 position.
