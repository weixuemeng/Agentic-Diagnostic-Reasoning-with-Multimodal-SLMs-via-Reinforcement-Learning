                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F trauma, motor vehicle collision
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Fractures of the left fifth through seven ribs are
 noted with increased lucency overlying the left lung base suspicious for a
 pneumothorax. No contralateral shift of the mediastinal structures is present
 to indicate tension. Minimal atelectasis is noted in the left lung base. No
 large pleural effusion is demonstrated. Leftward deviation of the trachea at
 the level of thoracic inlet may be due to the presence of a thyroid goiter. 
 Fracture of the right seventh lateral rib is also noted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left fifth through seventh lateral rib fractures with findings suspicious for
 a left-sided pneumothorax.  Fracture of the right seventh lateral rib.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Further assessment with contrast-enhanced CT of the chest
 is recommended.
