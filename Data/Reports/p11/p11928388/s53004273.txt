 changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with increased perihilar opacification consistent with central
 pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe. Blunting of the costophrenic angles could reflect mild
 pleural effusions.
