                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___ year old woman with STEMI presenting after MVA.  // Interval change;
 pulmonary edema vs consolidation      .
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.  A nasoenteric tube is present
 with its side port at the GE junction. If the desired location of a side port
 is within the stomach, it can be advanced approximately 5 cm. The mediastinal
 contour remains widened with a new left juxtahilar opacity, likely
 representing atelectasis. There is no large pneumothorax. Relative opacity of
 the left lung likely represents dense layering pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left juxtahilar opacity, likely represents atelectasis, as demonstrated on
 yesterday's chest CT.
 2. Persistent widening of the mediastinum.
 3. Mild increased opacity involving the left hemithorax likely represents
 layering pleural fluid.
