 THE upper mediastinum, predominantly to the right of the trachea, has widened

 could be due to active mediastinal bleeding or severe mediastinal vascular
 engorgement. Some of the cervicothoracic component is attributable to the very
 large right thyroid mass or abscess shown on the torso CT. Cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal size, increased only slightly.  Lungs are clear despite multiple
 left-sided rib fractures.  ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard
 placements.

 would require gated chest CTA.
