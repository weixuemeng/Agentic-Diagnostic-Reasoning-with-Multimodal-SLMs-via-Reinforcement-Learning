                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new HOTN and sob, likely volume overPaded 
 // Acute intrathoracic process?      Acute intrathoracic process?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Again the nasogastric tube is difficult to demonstrate distal to the lower
 esophagus.  Right IJ catheter tip appears to extend to the right atrium.  Due
 to the patient position is very difficult to assess the left lower lung. The
 hemidiaphragm is obscured, which could reflect substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and possible small effusion. Indistinctness of pulmonary
 markings suggests some degree of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
