                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chf, ckd  // ? Acute cardiopulmonary
 process      ? Acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17 38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film dated ___ at 18 21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasogastric tube remains in place but only can be seen to the level the
 mid esophagus and therefore the positioning cannot be assessed on this image.
 A right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the
 proximal right atrium.
 
 There has been slight interval improvement in lung volumes with residual
 patchy opacities in both upper lobes and in the left retrocardiac region.
 These findings would be concerning for pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema
 given the distribution. Clinical correlation is advised. There is slight
 improved aeration at the right lung base. Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
