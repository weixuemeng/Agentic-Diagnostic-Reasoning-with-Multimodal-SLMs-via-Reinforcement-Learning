 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged including surgical clips projecting along the anterior left side of
 the mediastinum.  A confluent opacity in the left lower lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia.  There is also a small component of opacification in the lingula. 
 Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.  There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

 Findings suggest pneumonia involving of the left lower lobe and perhaps to
 some extent the lingula.
