                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with headache and blurred vision.  Evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most present on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with the prior exam, there has been interval slight
 worsening of bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities as well as upper
 vascular redistribution, concerning for mild pulmonary edema. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed from prior. 
 Cardiac silhouette is grossly stable given differences in technique and
 inspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable with tortuous aorta.
 A vague amorphous lucency measuring 5 cm in length, up to 2.9 cm transverse
 projecting over the cardiac silhouette in the midline, just inferior to the
 left main bronchus may represent air within a hiatal hernia, a distended
 esophagus, or may relate to external artifact.  Not well localized on the
 lateral view.  Consider repeat frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild interstitial edema in the setting
 of stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 Vague amorphous lucency projecting over the cardiac silhouette in the midline,
 just inferior to the left main bronchus may represent air within a hiatal
 hernia, a distended esophagus, or may relate to external artifact.  Not well
