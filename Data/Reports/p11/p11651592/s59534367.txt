  1. Apparent distortion of the right hilar contour and right cardiac border,
  raising the possibility of underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
  2. Ill-defined opacity projecting over two vertebral bodies, which may
  represent an osteophyte versus underlying lung nodule.

 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lateral view demonstrates an 24 mm wide lobulated opacity projecting over the
 lower portion of a mid thoracic vertebral body, which could be osteophytes or
 a lung nodule.  The right hilus and adjacent mediastinal contours are somewhat
 distorted, possibly enlarged, and could be due to adenopathy.   Heart size is
 top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible right hilar and adjacent mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 2. Possible lung nodule lung nodule.
