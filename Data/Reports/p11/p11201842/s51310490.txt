                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p right upper lobectomy and right middle lobe
 wedge resection - please take at 16:00  // chest tube removal - interval
 change/ptx - please take at 16:00
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the chest tube is been removed.  A small right
 apical pneumothorax is visible.  In retrospect, this is probably unchanged.  A
 bleb like lucency is also now visible along the edge of the elevated right
 hemidiaphragm, of uncertain significance.  This does not clearly represent a a
 portion of the pneumothorax.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema along the right
 neck and right chest and abdominal wall is again noted, relatively similar.
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to the prior study.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette including the right paratracheal/pericarinal
 opacity is unchanged.  Vascular plethora in both upper zones is similar to the
 prior study.
 
 There has been slight interval increase in patchy opacity immediately above
 the right hemidiaphragm slightly.  Atelectasis at the left base and minimal
 blunting of left costophrenic angle is similar to the prior study.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right apical pneumothorax.  In retrospect, this is probably
 unchanged.
 2. Small bleb like lucency at the right lung base is of uncertain etiology,
 not clearly part of the pneumothorax.  Attention to this area on followup
 films is requested.
 3. Slight interval increase in patchy opacity at the right lung base, question
 atelectasis.
