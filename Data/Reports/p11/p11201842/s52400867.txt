 right chest and abdomen is again noted.  No obvious pneumothorax is detected. 
 Patchy opacity along the mid and lower right chest wall and atelectasis at the
 right base again noted, grossly similar to the prior study.  The possibility
 of a small amount of pleural fluid is suspected, also similar to the prior
 study.  Minimal atelectasis in the left costophrenic region  appears slightly
 more pronounced on the current study.  Equivocal minimal blunting at the left
 costophrenic angle noted , without gross effusion.  Doubt overt CHF. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but grossly unchanged.
