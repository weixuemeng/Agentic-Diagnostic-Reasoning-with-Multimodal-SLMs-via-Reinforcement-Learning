                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chronic cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral geographic foci of interstitial abnormality is present,
 most conspicuous in the left greater than right upper lobes.  There is no
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size,
 the mediastinal contours are normal, although calcification of the aortic knob
 is present.  There is partial visualization of lumbar fixation hardware, which
 appears uncomplicated;  anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 is mild. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral interstitial abnormality, likely reflecting a viral
 or atypical pneumonia rather than heart failure given the normal cardiac size.
