                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  There has been prior aortic
 valve replacement.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a new diffuse mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality
 most suggestive of congestive heart failure.  Streaky left basilar opacities
 suggest atelectasis.  There are small new pleural effusions as well.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Slight loss in height of mid-to-lower lumbar
 vertebral bodies appears similar.  There are two moderate biconcave lower
 thoracic compression deformities; the more superior, in the mid thoracic
 spine, appears somewhat increased.  Anterior flowing osteophytes are similar
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality, most suggestive of
 congestive heart failure.
