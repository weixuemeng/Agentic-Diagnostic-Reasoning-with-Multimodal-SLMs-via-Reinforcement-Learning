                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC is present, and is visible to the level of the
 junction of the right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, but the tip is not
 confidently visualized on this radiograph.  It could potentially be obscured
 by an indwelling right internal jugular vascular catheter.  If warranted
 clinically, an oblique view could be obtained to better visualize the
 catheter.  Widening of mediastinum is likely due to mediastinal lipomatosis
 given extensive mediastinal fat present on prior thoracic MRI spine study of
 ___.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.  Lungs
 are clear except for a linear focus of atelectasis in the left mid lung
 region.  Postoperative changes are present within the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of PICC is not confidently visualized.  Additional oblique
 view of the chest could be obtained for better visualization if warranted
 clinically.
