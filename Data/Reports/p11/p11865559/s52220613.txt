                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multiple rib fractures.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___ radiograph examination.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph demonstrates normal heart size and
 mediastinum.  Hardware of the upper mid thoracic spine is unremarkable in
 appearance.  No definitive rib fracture is demonstrated.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.  If clinically warranted, correlation with dedicated
 rib series might be considered.
