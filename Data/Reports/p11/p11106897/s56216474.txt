                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:18.
 
 CHEST, AP PORTABLE:  New endotracheal tube terminates 1.7 cm above the carina.
 There is worsening moderate pulmonary edema, now with central vascular
 engorgement as well as ___ A and B lines.  Right upper and bilateral lower
 lobe opacities persist.  Relative increase in right upper lobe density in this
 short time interval likely represents redistribution of edema.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is present.  Prosthetic mitral valve and median sternotomy wires.
 Probable small pleural effusion, though the right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ETT 1.7 cm from carina, please retract 2-4 cm.  This was paged to Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 1 a.m.
 2.  Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Concern for underlying pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe.
