 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of the right and left apical lung.  Atelectasis on the left has
 substantially decreased in severity.  The cardiac silhouette is now better
 visible.  Mild atelectasis at the lung bases, left more than right, however,
 persists.  The signs indicative of pulmonary edema are no longer visible. 
 Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
