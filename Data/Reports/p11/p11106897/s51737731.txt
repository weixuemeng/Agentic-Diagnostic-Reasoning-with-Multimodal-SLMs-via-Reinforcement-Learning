                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVR, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and mild increase in pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at
 the left base most likely reflects atelectasis and effusion.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
