  An endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina.  Aside from linear
  atelectasis at the left lung base, lungs are unremarkable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 passes below the diaphragm, outside the field of view.
 
 There is retrocardiac linear atelectasis at the left lung base.  Lung volumes
 are low with associated crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are normal.
 
 Surgical clips projecting over the with right upper quadrant are presumably
 related to cholecystectomy.  A radiopaque pin projecting over the left lung
 apex is likely external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina.  A radiopaque pin
 projecting over the left lung apex is presumably external to the patient.
