                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain x1 week, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes with bibasilar opacities which likely represent atelectasis and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Please note given this appearance, lower lung
 consolidation/pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.
 Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities most likely represent a combination of
 atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 Please refer to subsequent CTA for further details including findings of
 extensive pulmonary embolism.
