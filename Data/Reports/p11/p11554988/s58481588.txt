                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Necrotizing pancreatitis with new acute renal failure.  Evaluate
 for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  A feeding tube passes into the stomach
 and off the inferior margin of the film.  In addition, a catheter passing over
 the right upper quadrant is of unclear etiology.  There is a left IJ approach
 central line, extending to the upper SVC.
 
 The lung volumes remain low, with bilateral pleural effusions causing
 opacities of the lower lung fields.  There is associated basilar atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema is worsened from one day prior.  There
 is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia, though one could easily be
 obscured in the lower lung zones.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistently low lung volumes, with bilateral pleural effusions
 and atelectasis and mildly worsened pulmonary edema.  A pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
