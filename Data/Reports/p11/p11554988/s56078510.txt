                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:30 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Low-grade fever and increasing white count, assess pneumonia or
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  There has been an increase in bilateral
 infrahilar consolidation, though whether this represents atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia is really radiographically indeterminate.  Moderate
 left pleural effusion is larger, although pulmonary edema, if any, is minimal.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but mediastinal venous engorgement has
 progressed.  Dual-channel right supraclavicular hemodialysis catheter set ends
 low in the right atrium.  Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  No pneumothorax.
