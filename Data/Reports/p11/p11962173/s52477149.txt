 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 6:48 AM
  INDICATION:  Fever, postop.  Evaluate for acute process.
  
  COMPARISON:  None.
  
  FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the
  heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is pulmonary
  venous congestion without evidence of interstitial edema.  The lungs are
  clear.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
  There are no pleural abnormalities.  Surgical clips are seen in the right
  upper quadrant of the abdomen.
  
  IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, postop.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the
 heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Fullness in the
 lower pole of the right hilum could be due to overlapping vessels.  When
 feasible a repeat frontal view should be obtained at full inspiration. There
 is pulmonary venous congestion without evidence of interstitial edema.  The
 lungs are clear.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 are no pleural abnormalities.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No clear evidence of acute cardiac or pulmonary process. Suggest
 repeat CXR at full inspiration to re-evaluated right hilum.
