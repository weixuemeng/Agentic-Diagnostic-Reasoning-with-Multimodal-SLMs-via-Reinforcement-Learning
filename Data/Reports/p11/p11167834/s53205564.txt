                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are diffuse, bilateral interstitial opacities, greater on the right
 than on the left, with central pulmonary vascular congestion and scattered
 bronchial wall thickening.  The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, stable
 since prior examinations.  There is likely a small left pleural effusion,
 persistent since prior examinations.  Ill-defined opacity in the right upper
 lung is likely a combination of Fissural fluid and adjacent atelectasis.
 Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, though infection is not
 excluded.  A hiatal hernia is present.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Rightward tracheal deviation may be positional.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral interstitial abnormalities relatively similar to prior
 examinations with small right fissural fluid and left pleural effusion may be
 consistent with mild edema.
