                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sCHF (EF ___%), dCHF, Afib, now with
 elevated troponins and hypoxia  // Assess for worsening edema vs PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Interstitial edema has resolved in the interval, and a
 nonspecific right upper lobe opacity has nearly resolved.  Note is made of
 worsening opacities at both lung bases,  which may be due to atelectasis,
 aspiration, or developing pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are also
 evident.
