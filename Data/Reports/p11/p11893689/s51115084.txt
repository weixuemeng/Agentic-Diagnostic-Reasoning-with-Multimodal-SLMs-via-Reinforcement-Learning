                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with small bowel disease
 and no appropriate NG tube output.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 The left subclavian line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  The NG tube tip
 appears to be in the stomach, although the side hole is relatively proximal
 and thus the NG tube should be further advanced.  The stomach is substantially
 distended as well as the bowel that could be seen at the CT abdomen obtained
 on same-day.
 
 Contrast material is seen in the right kidney with hydronephrosis, better
 assessed on the CT abdomen as well.
