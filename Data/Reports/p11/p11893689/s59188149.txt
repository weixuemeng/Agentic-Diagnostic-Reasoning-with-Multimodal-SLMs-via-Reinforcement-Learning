                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Colon cancer, recent ureteral stent, now with severe
 abdominal pain, assess for free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Port-A-Cath
 resides over the left axilla with catheter tip extending to the level of the
 low SVC.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.  Partially imaged
 stent in the left flank region likely represents the ureteral stent.  Lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings, including no signs of pneumoperitoneum.
