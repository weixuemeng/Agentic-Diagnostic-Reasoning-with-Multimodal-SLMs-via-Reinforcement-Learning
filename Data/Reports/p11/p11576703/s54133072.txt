                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Moderate unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta appears similar.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is similar flattening of the hemidiaphragms with an expanded
 anteroposterior dimension of the chest, consistent overall with
 hyperinflation.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear.  In the upper abdomen, nonspecific air-fluid levels
 are visualized, fully characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. 
 Air-fluid levels visualized along bowel in the epigastrium, not fully
 characterized.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
