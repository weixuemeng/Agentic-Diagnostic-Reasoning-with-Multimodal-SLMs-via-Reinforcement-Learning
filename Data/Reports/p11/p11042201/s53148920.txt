                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // PNA?
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly increased left lung base opacity is likely due to increased small to
 moderate pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia
 is possible in correct clinical setting. Previously seen interstitial edema in
 the right lung is improved. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the left lung
 base opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased left lung base opacity could due to increased small to
 moderate pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia
 is possible in correct clinical setting. Previously seen interstitial edema in
 the right lung is improved, further supporting possibility of pneumonia
 causing the left lung base consolidation, rather than fluid overload.
