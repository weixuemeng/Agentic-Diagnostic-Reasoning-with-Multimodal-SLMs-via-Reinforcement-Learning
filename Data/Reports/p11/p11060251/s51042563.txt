                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with near syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally may
 suggest chronic pleural thickening.  There is streaky atelectasis in the left
 lower lobe.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Marked degenerative
 changes are seen involving both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung hyperinflation suggestive of underlying COPD.  Streaky left basilar
 atelectasis.
