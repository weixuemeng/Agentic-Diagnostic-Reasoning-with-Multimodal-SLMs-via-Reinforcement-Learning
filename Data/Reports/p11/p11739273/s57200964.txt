                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.  Evaluate for right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The chest is somewhat underpenetrated due to body habitus.  Volumes
 are slightly low, but there is no focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 Soft tissue fullness obliterates the right paratracheal stripe and the lateral
 view shows posterior displacement of the trachea. These could indicate
 mediastinal adenopathy or fat depositon. Any prior imaging should be obtained
 for review prior to requesting CT scan for evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mediastinal adenopathy. Check for any prior imaging to
 see if this is a new finding before requesting Chest CT scan. No evidence of
 acute cardiopulmonary. abnormality.
