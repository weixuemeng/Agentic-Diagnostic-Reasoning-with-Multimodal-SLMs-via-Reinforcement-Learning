                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or infiltrate in a patient with
 endometrial cancer status post TAH/BSO, requiring BiPAP over night.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right internal
 jugular catheter terminating in the mid SVC.  The patient has been extubated. 
 Lung volumes remain low with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Even allowing for this, the heart is enlarged. 
 There is persistent mild pulmonary edema, minimally improved compared to the
 day prior.  Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, are
 unchanged.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally improved mild pulmonary edema.
