                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of decortication of the left lung
 for pneumonia, now presenting with cough productive of sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Overall increased density of the bilateral
 lung bases is likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation.  No definite
 confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or large
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 likely exaggerated due to lowe lung volumes.  Mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm appears unchanged from prior.  A known cystic lesion within the
 left lower lobe is not apparent on this radiographic examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant overlying soft tissue attenuation, limiting
 evaluation, though no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Lung parenchyma
 can be more fully evaluated on chest CT which is planned for today.
