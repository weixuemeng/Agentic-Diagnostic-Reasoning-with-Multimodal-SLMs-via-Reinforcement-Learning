                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma presenting with increasing cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter is unchanged in position.  A
 small to moderate left pleural effusion with associated bibasilar atelectasis
 is unchanged from prior exam.  Effusion and right atelectatic change make
 evaluation of the cardiac border difficult, however the heart is likely
 enlarged. Severe compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
 unchanged from prior study.  Infection cannot be excluded given the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.
