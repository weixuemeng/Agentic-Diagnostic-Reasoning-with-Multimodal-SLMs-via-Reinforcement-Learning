                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with heroin abuse and IV drug abuse presenting
 with fever, cough and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar opacities in the superior segment of the left lower lobe and
 posterior right lower lobe are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There is
 no pleural effusion, and the heart is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe opacities are concerning for multifocal pneumonia,
 possibly secondary to aspiration given history of drug abuse.  Asymmetrical
 edema is less likely. Recommend follow-up radiograph after treatment to assess
 for resolution.
