                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain question pneumonia 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal radiographs of the chest demonstrate top normal heart size.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. Increase opacity
 in the left lower lung could be due to overlying soft tissues, but could
 represent infection in the correct clinical setting. Vague opacity in the left
 lower lung unchanged from prior study and previously characterized on CT at
 subpleural fat.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib
 fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy opacity overlying the left lower hemithorax could be due to overlying
 soft tissues, but dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended to
 further evaluate this region to exclude an infectious consolidation in the
 left lower lobe.
 
 Telephone notification to Dr ___ by Dr ___ at 7:45 ___.
