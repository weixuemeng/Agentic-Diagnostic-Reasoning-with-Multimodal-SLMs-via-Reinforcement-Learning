                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male with chronic shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON: PA & lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well expanded bilaterally with ill-defined opacity in the
 left lower lung also present on the prior study.  This could be a scar, but it
 is not seen well enough to be sure it is unchanged; instead it needs
 evaluation as a possible mass, with CT scanning.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The normal cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lung mass warrants CT scanning. No
 pneumonia.
