                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy as before.  Presence of multiple surgical
 clips in the anterior mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery. 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The thoracic aorta is of ordinary ___ but
 shows some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  No local
 contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and
 the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the
 apical area.  Relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms
 suggest the possibility of COPD, but again these findings existed already on
 the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post previous bypass surgery, no evidence of pulmonary
 congestion or acute infiltrates in this ___-year-old female patient with
 persistent cough.
 
 On the lateral view, presence of stabilization screw devices in the upper
 lumbar spine is observed, a finding not present on previous examinations.
