                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain status post aortic valve replacement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 4.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is persistent extensive left lower lobe
 opacification which is not specific but could be seen with persistent,
 although somewhat improved, combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. 
 Streaky right mid lung opacity was also present before and more suggestive of
 scarring or atelectasis. A small pleural effusion on the right may have
 decreased mildly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild improvement in left lower lobe opacity and pleural effusion.
