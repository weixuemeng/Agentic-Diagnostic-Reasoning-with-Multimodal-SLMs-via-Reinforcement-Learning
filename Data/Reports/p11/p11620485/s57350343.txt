                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AVR  // predischarge eval
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette substantially larger than the
 preoperative appearance has not improved, is due to cardiomegaly and, more
 likely mediastinal or pericardial fluid accumulation. However pericardial or
 mediastinal fluid collection, even if substantial, is unlikely to be
 hemodynamically significant with normal caliber mediastinal veins, especially
 the azygos vein.
 
 Severe left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions, small on the right
 and small to moderate on the left have also not cleared. There is no pulmonary
 edema and no pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. Transvenous
 right atrial right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses,
 unchanged.
