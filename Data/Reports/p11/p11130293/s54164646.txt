                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 18:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple rib fractures, right
 pneumothorax, now with chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 3:38.
 
 AP portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 18:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Feeding tube remains in place coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  There has been interval placement of a right basilar chest
 tube.  The moderate-sized right pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size,
 although there still is a significant anterior component in the costophrenic
 sulcus.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  A trace amount of
 air is seen within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues.  There is
 increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, left greater than
 right, which may reflect asymmetric interstitial edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Probable small layering left effusion
 with retrocardiac opacification which may represent compressive atelectasis.
