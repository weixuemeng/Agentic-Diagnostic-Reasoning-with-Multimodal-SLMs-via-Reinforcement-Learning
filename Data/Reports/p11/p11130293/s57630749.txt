                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Multiple right-sided prior rib
 fractures with a associated pleural thickening are again seen.  Previously
 seen left upper lobe/perihilar opacity has decreased in the interval with
 possible minimal residual remaining.  There is also a small opacity at the
 right lung base, difficult to determine whether this represents
 scarring/atelectasis from previously larger pleural effusion or whether could
 represent a consolidation due to infection or aspiration.  The previously seen
 and pleural effusions have significantly decreased in the interval with
 possible very trace right effusion remaining.  The aorta is tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  Biapical pleural thickening again seen.
