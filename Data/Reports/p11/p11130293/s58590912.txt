 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new left pneumothorax.  Evaluate progress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 4:58 a.m.:
 
 Moderate-to-large left pneumothorax has increased slightly since 5 a.m.,
 predominantly at the left base laterally.  Right lower lobe collapse has
 improved, but still involves more than one basal segment.  Volume of
 pneumothorax has decreased while that of small-to-moderate pleural effusion
 has increased.  Heart size is normal.  Multiple right rib fractures have a
 stable degree of displacement, some substantial, but there has been no
 increase in the volume of relatively small extrapleural hematoma.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:10 p.m., one minute following recognition of the
