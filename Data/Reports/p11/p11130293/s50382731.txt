                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with feeding tube, check placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Two portable semi-erect chest films ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  On the initial image, the tip of the nasogastric tube is within a hiatal
 hernia, but on subsequent imaging it now appears to project just below the
 diaphragm.  There is a slowly increasing moderate-sized right pneumothorax
 with air now surrounding the entire lung when compared to studies dating back
 to ___.  No left-sided pneumothorax is appreciated.  There is no evidence
 of tension at this time.  There are small bilateral effusions with associated
 airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to fully assess due to marked patient
 rotation on the current study.  No pulmonary edema.  Multiple right-sided rib
 fractures as well as right clavicular fracture is again seen.  The patient's
 nurse, ___, was notified of the presence of the right-sided pneumothorax on
 ___ at 10:32 a.m. at the time of discovery.
