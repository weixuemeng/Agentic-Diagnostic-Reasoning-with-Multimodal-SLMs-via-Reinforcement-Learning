 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with trauma, rib fractures, check

 obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day.  Chest findings are grossly
 unaltered.  Noted is, however, the placement of a NG tube of Dobbhoff type,
 the tip of which has passed the diaphragm and reaches the fundus portion of
 the stomach.  No gross interval changes of the chest findings in comparison
 with the previous study.
