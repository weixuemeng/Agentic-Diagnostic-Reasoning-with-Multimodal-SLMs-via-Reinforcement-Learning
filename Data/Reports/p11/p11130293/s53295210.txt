                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.  On the right side, there is a
 moderate sized pneumothorax which is slightly enlarged compared to the prior
 radiograph.  There is a small to moderate extrapleural hematoma at the lateral
 aspect of the right lung.  In the right lower lung, there is a new
 opacification which likely represents lower lobe collapse.  Multiple
 right-sided rib fractures, with substantial displacement are noted, and are
 unchanged from the prior radiograph.
 
 On the left side, there is a moderate to large sized left pneumothorax which
 is new from the prior study.  Additionally, there is opacification at the
 posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, indicating lobar collapse.
 
 The heart size is normal and the mediastinum is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Slight interval increase in size of right-sided pneumothorax with new right
 lower lobar collapse.
 
 2. New moderate to large left-sided pneumothorax with left lower lobe
 posterior basal segment collapse.
 
 These findings were relayed to the house staff taking care of the patient
 including Dr. ___, by Dr. ___, at 9:35, upon discovery.
