 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:01 PM
  Continued improved aeration of the left lung particularly evident in the lower
  lung on the current study.  Likely decreased left pleural effusion, now small
  in size.  No definite pneumothorax identified.  Interval placement of a
  Dobbhoff tube.  Initial imaging demonstrates tube terminating in the distal
  esophagus with subsequent image demonstrating advancement into the proximal
  stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior studies, including most
 recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal portable views of the chest demonstrate interval
 improvement in aeration of the left lung, particularly in the lower lung
 compared to the prior study.  There is a decrease in left pleural effusion,
 which is now small in size.  No pneumothorax is present.  There has been
 interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which on initial imaging terminates in
 the distal esophagus, and on subsequent image, it is advanced into the
 proximal stomach, in appropriate position.  Displaced right rib fractures are
 unchanged since the prior study, along with stable heart size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Interval improvement in aeration of the left lung with decrease in left
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Dobbhoff tube terminates in the fundus of the stomach.
