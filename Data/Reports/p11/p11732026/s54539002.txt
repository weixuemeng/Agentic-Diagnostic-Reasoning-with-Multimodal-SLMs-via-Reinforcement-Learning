                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to post-operative chest radiographs
 since ___:
 
 Yesterday's pulmonary edema has resolved.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged.  Moderately severe left and milder right basal atelectasis
 worsened following extubation, but have not changed.  Moderate enlargement of
 the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette similarly worsened with
 extubation, but not subsequently.  Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses.  No pneumothorax.
