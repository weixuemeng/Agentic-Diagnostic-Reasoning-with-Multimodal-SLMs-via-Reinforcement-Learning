 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of smoking.  Consider malignancy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are low in volume but clear of any focal abnormality.  Heart is normal
 size.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and generally large, but not focally
 aneurysmal.  Other mediastinal contours, hila, and pleural surfaces are
 normal.  Lower spinal osteophyte should not be mistaken for lung lesions, seen
 on the lateral view.
