                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the right chest tube, have been removed.  There is no
 evidence of a right pleural effusion, but right areas of atelectasis are seen
 at the lung bases.  On the left, a mild-to-moderate pulmonary effusion is
 unchanged.  Unchanged areas of retrocardiac atelectasis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and unchanged low lung volumes.
