                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after AVR and CABG.  Evaluate pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are still quite low, but improved since previous examination with
 substantial reexpansion of left lower lobe.  Atelectasis is still severe at
 the right lung base.  Upper lungs clear.  Pleural effusions are small,
 unchanged.  The enlargement of the postoperative cardiac silhouette suggests
 mediastinal or pericardial fluid collection, since there are no findings to
 suggest cardiac decompensation.
