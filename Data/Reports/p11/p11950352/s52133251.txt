                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Poor inspiratory effort, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  There is
 patchy opacity at the right lung base and, to a lesser extent, at the left
 base medially, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  Possible
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Incidental note is made of
 a left shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity, right-greater-than-left bases.  Particularly at the right
 base, the differential diagnosis could include an early pneumonic infiltrate.
