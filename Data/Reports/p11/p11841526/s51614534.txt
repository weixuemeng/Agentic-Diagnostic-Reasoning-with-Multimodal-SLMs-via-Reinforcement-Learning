                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube
 removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the cavoatrial junction.  Compared with the
 prior study, a left-sided chest tube has been removed.  Possible tiny left
 apical pneumothorax.
 
 As before, there are sternotomy wires with mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, compatible
 with mild CHF.  Platelike at atelectasis the right midzone again noted.
 
 Compared to the prior film, inspiratory volumes are lower and there is more
 pronounced increased retrocardiac opacity and atelectasis at the right base. 
 There is obscuration of both costophrenic angles which is new or more
 pronounced on the current study.
 
 Incidental note is made of marked narrowing of the right acromial humeral
 distance, consistent with chronic rotator cuff tear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of left chest tube.  Suspect tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 
 Mild vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF.  This
 appears slightly worse compared with the prior film.
 
 Lower inspiratory volumes with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation and
 possible small effusions.  The opacity is more pronounced at the left base.
 
 Findings compatible with chronic right rotator cuff tear.
