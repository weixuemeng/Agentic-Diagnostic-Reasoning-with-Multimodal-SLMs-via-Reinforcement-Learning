                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bibasilar ground-glass opacities.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison.  Reference
 made to abdomen/pelvis CT lung bases from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle patchy right base opacity is seen which is nonspecific and could be due
 to atelectasis or infection.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy right base opacity, atelectasis vs infection; the lung bases are better
 assessed on the CT.
