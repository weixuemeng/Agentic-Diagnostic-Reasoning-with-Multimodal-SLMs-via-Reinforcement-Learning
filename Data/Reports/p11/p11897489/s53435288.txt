                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present with more pronounced volume loss seen in the
 right lung compared to the left.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged with
 similar rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is most pronounced
 along the periphery and within the lung bases along with bronchiectasis,
 better assessed on the previous CT.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are mild multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease previously
 characterized as UIP without new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
