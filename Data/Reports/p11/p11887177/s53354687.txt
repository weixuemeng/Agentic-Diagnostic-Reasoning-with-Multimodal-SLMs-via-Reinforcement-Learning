                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for progression of pleural effusion, in a patient with
 hypoxia and pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  The right pleural effusion is increased in size, now moderate,
 with associated atelectasis.  No left pleural effusion is present.  There is
 no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate right pleural effusion, similar to slightly increased.
 2. Slightly increased opacity in the right lung may reflect atelectasis or
 asymmetric edema.
