                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with large thick loculated right pleural effusion
 s/p chest tube placement with no output  // ? PTX, ? tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, and ___, and CT
 of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate right
 pleural effusion and consolidation of the right lower lobe. Additionally,
 there is a subpleural nodule seen in the right upper lobe, with lucent center,
 which suggests the presence of cavitation.  The left lung is clear. No
 pneumothorax.  A right-sided pleural drainage catheter is present, however it
 is not possible on the basis of this single frontal radiograph to determine
 whether this pleural drainage catheter is supra- or subdiaphragmatic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate right pleural effusion, and consolidation of the right lower lobe.
 2. Subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe with lucent center, which
 suggests the presence of cavitation.
 3. Right pleural drainage catheter present.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  If further evaluation of the area of consolidation is
 necessary, recommend CT of the chest with contrast.  These recommendations
 were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 2:30pm on
 ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
