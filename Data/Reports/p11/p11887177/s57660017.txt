                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with NSCLC presents with acute on chronic right
 chest pain exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion appears slightly decreased in size
 compared to the previous radiograph, a component of which is loculated
 laterally as well as within the major fissure.  Lateral spiculated nodular
 opacity within the right upper lobe remains grossly stable.  Right basilar
 opacity likely reflecting combination of compressive atelectasis and tumor is
 not changed.  Linear opacities within the right upper lobe may reflect
 scarring and are also not substantially changed, though lymphangitic spread of
 tumor cannot be excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise
 unchanged.  The left lung demonstrates emphysematous changes without focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests a
 trace left pleural effusion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size partially loculated right pleural effusion appears slightly
 decreased in size compared to the most recent radiograph.  Continued
 compressive atelectasis with tumor in the right lung base and linear opacities
 in the right upper lobe, the latter of which may reflect fibrotic changes but
 lymphangitic spread of tumor is not excluded.  Re- demonstration of spiculated
 nodular opacity within the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe.  Trace left
 pleural effusion.
