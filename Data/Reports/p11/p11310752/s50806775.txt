                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 15:09.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, there is little change.  Again demonstrated are
 heterogeneous opacities in the in right mid and lower lung zones.  There
 appears to be a moderate size loculated right pleural fluid collection. A
 patchy opacity at the left base is noted. There is no left pleural effusion. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new No pneumothorax is identified. 
 There is persist prominence of the right mediastinal and hilar contours. The
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung are consistent with history of
 pneumonia. Consider a contrast-enhanced chest CT to exclude a postobstructive
 process and to better characterize an apparently loculated right pleural
 effusion, the latter raising the possibility of empyema.
 2.  New patchy opacity at the left base is nonspecific, but may reflect
 additional site of infection,
 3. New pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 These above abnormalities can be further evaluated with a CT of the chest.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT of the chest.
