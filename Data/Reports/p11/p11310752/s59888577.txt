                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly increased from the prior study
 accounting for differences in technique. The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Right
 hilar enlargement appears new compared to the previous exam. Mild pulmonary
 edema is present. Hazy opacification within the right mid and lower lung is
 new in the interval. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Clips are seen projecting over the
 left breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Hazy opacification in the right mid and lower could reflect an area of
 infection. Right hilar enlargement may suggest underlying lymphadenopathy.
 2. Patchy opacities in the lungs, potentially atelectasis but additional sites
 of infection are not excluded.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT of the chest is recommended for further assessment.
