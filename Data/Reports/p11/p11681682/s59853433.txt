                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea x 1 week, worsening  // CHF vs COPD vS
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter and left-sided subclavian
 central venous catheter terminate in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are low. This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. "Rugger ___" appearance of the thoracic spine is compatible
 with renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
