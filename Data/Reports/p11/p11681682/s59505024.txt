                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The examination is limited by
 poor penetration likely secondary to the patient's body habitus.  Within this
 limitation, the lungs appear well expanded without focal consolidation to
 suggest infectious process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
