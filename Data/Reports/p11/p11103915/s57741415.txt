                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the heart size, and crowding the
 bronchovascular structures.  Nodular opacities overlying the spine seen on the
 lateral view appear unchanged compared to the prior chest radiograph, as does
 atelectasis or scarring in the right mid and upper lung.  Bilateral
 costophrenic angle blunting may likely represents small pleural effusions. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy changes and densely calcified
 thoracic aorta are again noted.  Severe vertebral compression deformity of the
 L1 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Posterior nodular opacities abutting the pleural surface seen on the
 lateral view are likely in the right lung base, and appear similar compared to
 the prior radiograph from ___.  Agree with previous recommendation
 for CT scan with contrast non urgently.
