                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis now with sob and wheezes.  // Please
 evaluate for etiology of shortness of breath
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New opacities, in particular right infrahilar opacity and increased
 retrocardiac and lingular opacities are concerning for pneumonia in setting of
 sepsis.
 
 Cardiomegaly is again seen, similar to prior.  There is worsened CHF, with
 evidence of interstitial edema and with fluid in the minor fissure.   Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Lung volumes otherwise better.
 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Severe left glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacities raise the possibility of multifocal infectious infiltrates.
 
 Worsening CHF with interstitial edema and fluid in the minor fissure. 
 Possible small bilateral effusions.
 
 Please see report of prior ___ chest x-ray which identified nodular
 opacities abutting the posterior inferior chest wall on the lateral view for
 which (nonurgent) CT scan with contrast was recommended. These are not
 directly visualized on this AP-only examination.
