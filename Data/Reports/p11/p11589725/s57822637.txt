  1. Enteric tube terminating within the stomach, with the side port proximal to
  the GE junction within the distal esophagus.  This can be advanced several cm
  for all side ports to be contained with the stomach, as clinically indicated.
  2. The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized.
  3. Other supporting lines and tubes are unchanged in position.  The visualized
  lungs are grossly clear.
  Findings discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
  approximately ___, 50 minutes after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o seizures alcoholism s/p fall down stairs resulting in
 status epilepticus and right IPH, unchanged bilateral SDH, unchanged SAH, and
 acute fracture of the inferior left parietal bone with associated 2 mm
 epidural hematoma.  Eval OGT position. Please perform at 6pm.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm a terminates within the
 stomach.  The side port is proximal to the GE junction within the distal
 esophagus.  Endotracheal tube is no longer visualized.  Left PICC line
 terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusions, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasoenteric tube terminates within the stomach, but the side-hole is
 proximal to the GE junction in the distal esophagus.  This should be advanced
 several cm for all side ports to be contain in the stomach, as clinically
 indicated.
