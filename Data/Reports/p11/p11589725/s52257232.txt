                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o seizures   alcoholism s/p fall down stairs resulting in
 status epilepticus and right IPH, unchanged bilateral SDH, unchanged SAH, and
 acute fracture of the inferior left parietal bone with associated 2 mm
 epidural hematoma  // interval cxr
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Dobhoff type tube with radiopaque tip overlying the gastric fundus.  Left
 subclavian central line with tip over mid/distal SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 unchanged.  Mild vascular plethora is suggested, similar to the prior film. 
 However, this appearance is likely accentuated due to low inspiratory volumes.
 Minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases again noted, similar to the prior
 film.  No frank consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for lower inspiratory volumes, doubt significant interval change.
