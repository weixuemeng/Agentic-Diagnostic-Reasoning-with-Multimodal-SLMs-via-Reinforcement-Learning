                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o seizures   alcoholism s/p fall down stairs resulting in
 status epilepticus and right IPH, unchanged bilateral SDH, unchanged SAH, and
 acute fracture of the inferior left parietal bone with associated 2 mm
 epidural hematoma.  Position of ETT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina.  The NG tube has
 been advanced, with all sideholes contained within the stomach.  No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or large focal consolidation.  Left-sided PICC line is
 unchanged in position, terminating in the mid SVC.  Opacity in the medial
 right lower lung is likely due to crowding of vessels, given the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Opacity in the medial right lower lung is likely due to crowding of
 vessels, given the projection.  However, in the correct clinical setting,
 pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 3.  NG tube has been advanced several cm, now with all sideholes contained
 within the stomach.
