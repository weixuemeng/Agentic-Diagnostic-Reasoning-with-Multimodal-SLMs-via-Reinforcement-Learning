                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post bronchial biopsy.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Left PICC
 tip is in the lower SVC.  Right lower lobe opacity has minimally increased. 
 This is a combination of known right lower lobe consolidation and probably
 small area of hemorrhage.  Lingular opacities are grossly unchanged.
