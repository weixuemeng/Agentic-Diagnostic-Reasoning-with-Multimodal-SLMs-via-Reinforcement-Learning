                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lateral pleuritic chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged, not significantly changed
 since prior examination. Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures. However, as compared to prior examination,
 pulmonary vasculature appears slightly more prominent. Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis is present. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is
 identified. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions could be present if any.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
 suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
