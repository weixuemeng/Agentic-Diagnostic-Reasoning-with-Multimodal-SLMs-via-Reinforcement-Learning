                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Subsequent to the initial reading, prior chest radiographs became
 available for review dating back to ___. The wide left upper mediastinum
 extending into the soft tissues of the neck is entirely unchanged over ___
 years, and it is unlikely this abnormality is contributing toward acute signs
 and symptoms. Thyroid ultrasound has already documented the extent of thyroid
 pathology. .

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // R/o pneumonia      R/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiac and hilar silhouettes and pleural
 surfaces are normal. Fullness in the left cervicothoracic region displacing
 the trachea to the right is little changed since at least ___.
 Patient has had thyroid ultrasound showing bilateral thyroid lesions. This
 could explain the appearance.  Thyroid pathology could also explain chronic
 cough. If there is concern for other cervicothoracic pathology, CT scanning
 would be necessary.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is concern for other cervicothoracic pathology,
 CT scanning would be necessary
