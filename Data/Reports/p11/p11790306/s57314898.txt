                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with word finding difficulty.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen on both the
 frontal and lateral views.  Increased interstitial markings are seen
 throughout the lungs but most notably at the lung bases.  There is no pleural
 effusion or confluent consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic
 arch.  No definite acute osseous abnormality identified.  Thoracolumbar
 S-shaped scoliosis is identified with degenerative changes in the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with increased interstitial markings throughout both lungs
 most notably at the bases.  This may in part be due to atelectasis although
 underlying edema or chronic interstitial process such as fibrosis is possible
 given the lungs volume.  No definite focal consolidation.
