                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Linear areas of apparent
 scarring in the lingula appear similar to the prior radiograph.  Previously
 present calcification overlying the right lung base now projects lateral to
 the right lung and is apparently within the soft tissues of the right breast. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
