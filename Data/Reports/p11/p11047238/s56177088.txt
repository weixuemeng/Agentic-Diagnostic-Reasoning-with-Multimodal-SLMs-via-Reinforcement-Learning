                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and wheezing. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, portable.  There is left lower lobe atelectasis.  A more
 heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe with possible air-bronchograms
 is more suspicious for infection.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe with
 air-bronchograms may represent early pneumonia or atelectasis.
