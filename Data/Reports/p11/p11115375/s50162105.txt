                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess abnormalities on prior study.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  The mild
 prominence of basilar markings most likely are manifestation of chronic lung
 disease.
 
 No convincing evidence of acute focal pneumonia or appreciable vascular
 congestion.
