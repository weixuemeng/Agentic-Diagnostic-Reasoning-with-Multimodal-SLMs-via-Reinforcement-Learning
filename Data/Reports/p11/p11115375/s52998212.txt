 eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Bilateral interstitial
 opacities are chronic and most likely represent interstitial lung disease.  No
 new focal consolidations to suggest infectious process is currently seen.  No
 evidence of new consolidations demonstrated.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 overall in unremarkable position.
 
 If clinically warranted, assessment of the patient with chest CT for pre size
 characterization of the current status of interstitial lung disease is to be
 considered on non-emergency basis.
