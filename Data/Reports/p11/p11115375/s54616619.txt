                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left base
 atelectasis is seen.  There is slight increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally, most noted at the mid-to-lower lungs, most likely related to
 chronic lung disease.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
