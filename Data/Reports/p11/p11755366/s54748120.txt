                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement, CABG and chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The AP chest radiograph demonstrates still present minimal potentially
 pneumomediastinal versus medial pneumothorax and subcutaneous air, but no
 overt pneumothorax in the apex is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  There is improvement of pulmonary edema and no change in minimal
 bibasal atelectasis.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
