                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Likely aspiration pneumonia, to look for interval changes in the
 lung.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was read in comparison with most
 recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip lies 4.8 cm above the carina, left subclavian line tip
 is at mid SVC, and nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the
 stomach and are all appropriately positioned.  Consolidation in the right lung
 base has improved.  Increased retrocardiac density likely due to a combination
 of atelectasis and/or consolidation is unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema of
 similar severity persists.
