                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis.  Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the large left effusion may be very slightly
 smaller.  Overall, however, it appears unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, possibly very slightly smaller. The left heart border
 is obscured by the left-sided effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  Right lung is grossly clear, allowing for minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  No right-sided infiltrate or effusion. 
 No pneumothorax or pneumopericardium detected.  Rounded density at the right
 lung base is thought to represent a nipple shadow.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent large left pleural effusion, possibly slightly smaller.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette may very slightly smaller, but remains
 considerably enlarged.
