                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall, evaluate for rib fractures or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine frontal view of the lungs demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Streaky atelectasis is seen at the left
 lung base.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema are unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no displaced rib fracture.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. 
 2. No displaced rib fractures.  If there is focal tenderness and concern for a
 fracture persists, dedicated rib views with markers would be of utility.
