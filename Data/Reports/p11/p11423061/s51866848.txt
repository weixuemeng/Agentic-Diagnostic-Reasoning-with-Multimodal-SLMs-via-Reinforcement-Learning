                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new onset of productive cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam from
 ___ and CTA from ___.  New compared to prior are
 bibasilar regions of consolidation, partially silhouetting the hemidiaphragm
 on the left and blunting the lateral costophrenic angle.  There is also mild
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle as well, potentially on the left,
 raising possibility of trace effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 potentially more so when compared to prior exam given differences in
 inspiratory effort and technique.  Enteric tube is seen passing below the
 diaphragm.
 
 Osseous structures are again notable for wedge deformity in the lower thoracic
 spine/upper lumbar spine, which is not significantly changed compared to CTA
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bibasilar opacities compatible with pneumonia in the proper
 clinical setting.  Repeat exam after treatment is suggested to document
 resolution.  Alternatively, these findings can be seen in the setting of
 pulmonary edema.
