                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man who is intubated with altered mental status. 
 Evaluate ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT is 4 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube traverses the midline and its tip
 and side-port appear to be within the expected region of the stomach in the
 left upper quadrant.  Lung volumes are very low with bronchovascular crowding.
 Platelike streaky opacities in the right lower lungs most likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect atelectasis
 and or small pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity could be atelectasis or a
 focal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation, incompletely assessed
 on this single view.  Heart size cannot be assessed on exam.  No pneumothorax.
 No frank edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ETT is 4 cm above the carina.
 
 Low lung volumes and bilateral atelectasis.  Underlying focal consolidation
 cannot be assessed.
 
 Possible small left pleural effusion.
