  No significant interval change in the degree of aeration of the right lung,
  particularly given differences in acquisition technique.  A right-sided
  pigtail catheter appears to be in place, slightly changed in position compared
  to the prior exam.  Mild pulmonary edema seen throughout the left lung, is
  persistent.  Overall, no significant interval change.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening O2 requirement. Here for volume
 overload ___ cirrhosis, got 100lasix and 75g albumin today  // r/o worsening
 pulm edema     r/o worsening pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right pigtail catheter
 remains in place, though the position is somewhat change from the previous
 study.  The degree of aeration and opacification in the right hemithorax is
 stable with no evidence of pneumothorax.
 There is indistinctness of engorged vessels in the left hemithorax, consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure that is more prominent than on the
 previous study.  .
