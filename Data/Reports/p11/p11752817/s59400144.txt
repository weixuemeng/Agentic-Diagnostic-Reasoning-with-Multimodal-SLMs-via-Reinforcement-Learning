                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, recent right sided empyema, s/p
 elossier flap ___ now with mucous plug and atelectasis.  // assess mucous
 plug
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating ___ and ___.  CT chest with IV contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph performed yesterday afternoon,
 opacification of the right hemithorax appears to have improved slightly.  This
 suggests better aeration of the right lung. However, there is still a
 substantial right pleural effusion due to underlying empyema.  Small air
 collection at the right costophrenic sulcus that is contiguous with
 extrathoracic space, s/p Eloesser flap. There is also a small left pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise, the left lung is essentially clear.  Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly improved right lung aeration, suggesting some underlying atelectasis.
 However, there is persistent substantial opacification of right hemithorax
 likely due to empyema.
