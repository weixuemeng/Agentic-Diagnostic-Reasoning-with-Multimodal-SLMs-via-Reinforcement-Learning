                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT; confirm NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Sequential portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 19:31.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which terminates in
 the mid-esophagus on the initial radiograph, but is advanced on the subsequent
 radiograph to terminate in the stomach.  The moderate right pleural effusion
 corresponding to the known empyema is unchanged. A right basilar pigtail
 catheter remains in place with a small amount of loculated air within the
 pleural space inferiorly. The left lung remains relatively clear. The heart
 and mediastinum are magnified by the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube in satisfactory position. Otherwise no significant interval change.
