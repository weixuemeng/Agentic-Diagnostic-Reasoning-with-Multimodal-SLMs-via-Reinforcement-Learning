                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pleural effusion status post pigtail placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar pigtail catheter is new in the interval. Moderate size partially
 loculated right empyema appears decreased in size compared to the previous
 radiograph with increased air noted in the pleural space. There is minimally
 improved aeration in the right lung base compared to the previous radiograph
 with continued atelectasis noted. Rightward shift of mediastinal structures is
 re- demonstrated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged
 with the heart size within normal limits. The left lung is grossly clear. No
 left-sided pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right basilar pigtail chest tube. Partially loculated
 moderate size right empyema appears slightly decreased in size compared to the
 previous radiograph with persistent right basilar patchy opacity likely
 reflective of atelectasis.
