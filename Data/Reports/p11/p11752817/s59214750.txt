                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M c HCV cirrhosis and chronic right empyema s/p rib resection
 and drainage of empyema ___ now s/p right latissimus flap closure of
 empyema  // Pneumonia?, bloody mucus secretions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study, limiting assessment of the
 cardiomediastinal contour.  Nonetheless, the cardiomediastinal contour is
 grossly unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is a persistent right
 pleural effusion, this tracks superiorly over the apex of the lung.  This
 appears grossly unchanged compared to the prior study. There is associated
 right basilar atelectasis.  Airspace opacity in the right upper lung is
 similar in degree when compared to the prior study.  This may reflect a
 combination of atelectasis and layering of the pleural fluid, however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is evidence of prior rib
 resection in the right lower chest.  The left lung appears grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  Abnormal
 opacity in the aerated portion of the right lung may reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and layering of the pleural effusion however infection cannot be
 excluded.
