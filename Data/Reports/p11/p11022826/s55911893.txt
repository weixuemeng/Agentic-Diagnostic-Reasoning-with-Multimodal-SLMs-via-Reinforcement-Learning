                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent pneumonia, ESRD s/p transplant  //
 eval for interval change in possible R fungal ball
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a cavitary lesion in the
 superior segment of the right lower lobe is again demonstrated with apparent
 decrease in size of the intraluminal nodule previously interpreted as
 suspicious for a mycetoma.  2 adjacent cavitary lesions in the right apex are
 grossly unchanged.  No new or worsening lung abnormalities are detected. 
 Eighth cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Healed bilateral rib fractures
 are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent decrease in size of dependent nodular opacity within cavitary
 superior segment right lower lobe lesion, possibly representing a mycetoma. 
 This finding and 2 adjacent right apical cavities are somewhat difficult to
 compare radiographically and CT may thus be considered if precise assessment
 of interval change is warranted clinically.
