                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is
 a new opacity projecting over the mid spine on the lateral view, somewhat oval
 and mass-like, and it may correlate with very vague superior opacity in the
 right suprahilar region.  There is slight rightward convex curvature centered
 along the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia, best seen on the
 lateral view.  However, in order to exclude an unusual presentation of a mass,
 follow-up radiographs are recommended to show resolution within six to eight
 weeks.  Alternatively if complicated infection or neoplasm is suspected
 clinically, the chest CT may be helpful.
