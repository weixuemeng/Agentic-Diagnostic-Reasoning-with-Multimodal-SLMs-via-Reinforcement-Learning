                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DMI, kidney transplant and VFib arrest on
 floor  // s/p intubation   vFib arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina. Asymmetrical, right
 greater than left, pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion are new
 since yesterday.  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged which may be partly
 due to technique. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Widening of
 the mediastinum is likely due to increased intravascular volume and technique.
 Irregularity of the lateral portion of the seventh rib may represent a
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carinal.
 2.  Moderate, right greater than left, pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular
 congestion are new since yesterday.  In the appropriate clinical setting
