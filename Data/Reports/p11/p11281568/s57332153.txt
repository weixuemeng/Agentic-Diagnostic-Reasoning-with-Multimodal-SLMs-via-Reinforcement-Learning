                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, tracheostomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is similar. 
 Diffuse increased interstitial and ground-glass opacities are seen
 bilaterally, compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease with possible
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy catheter is noted with the distal
 aspect not completely imaged on this film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of diffuse increased interstitial ground-glass opacities
 bilaterally, likely reflecting a combination of chronic interstitial lung
 disease with superimposed mild pulmonary edema.
