                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, tachycardia with possible aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is in standard position.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 Diffuse course interstitial opacities are re- demonstrated bilaterally
 compatible with a chronic interstitial lung disease.  There may be mild
 superimposed pulmonary edema, though this is not as pronounced as on the
 previous examination.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy catheter is
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities likely reflective of the patient's known
 chronic fibrotic lung disease.  There may be superimposed mild pulmonary
 edema, though this is improved compared to the previous study.  No new focal
 consolidation.
