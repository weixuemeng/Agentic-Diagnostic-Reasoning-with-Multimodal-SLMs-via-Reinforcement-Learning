                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Orogastric tube extends only to the distal esophagus and must be
 pulled back several centimeters.
 
 Generalized hazy opacification of the left hemithorax is consistent with
 substantial residual effusion layering posteriorly.  No definite pneumothorax
 is appreciated.  Opacification at the right base is consistent with some
 pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Again there is evidence of previous
 esophagogastric pull-through, accounting for the prominence of the right
 paramedian contour.
 
 Striking dilatation of the gas-filled stomach is again seen.
