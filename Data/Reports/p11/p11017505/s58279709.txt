                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with thoracentesis of left pleural effusion. 
 Question post-procedural pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval decrease in
 a previously large left pleural effusion, with some residual fluid layering
 along the lateral chest wall.  There is no evidence to suggest pneumothorax. 
 Right pleural effusion with fissural loculation appears similar in
 configuration as compared to preceding exam.  There is persistent plate-like
 atelectasis in the right lung base and in the left base retrocardiac region. 
 Patient is status post esophagectomy with pullthrough, accounting for
 prominent right paramedian contour.  Gaseous distention of bowel loops is
 redemonstrated under the diaphragm, similar as corroborated with preceding CT
 from three days ago.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.
