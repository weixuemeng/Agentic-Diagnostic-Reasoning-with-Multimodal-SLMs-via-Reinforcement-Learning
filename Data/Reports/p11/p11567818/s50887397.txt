                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Prior pneumonia seen in ___.  Plan for colorectal
 cancer operation at the end of ___.  History of diastolic heart function.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest
 ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ill-defined left upper lobe opacification is stable or slightly
 bigger from the prior radiograph.  This is concerning for an underlying
 malignancy, tuberculosis, or less likely a persistent infection.  The
 opacification at the right lower lobe and previously present pulmonary edema
 have resolved.  Other than the left upper lobe opacity, the lungs are clear
 without edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A compression fracture of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body is stable.  An IVC filter is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable or slightly enlarged left upper lobe opacity may represent
 underlying malignancy, tuberculosis, or less likely a persistent infection.  A
 CT scan is required for further evaluation.
 2.  No pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable compression fracture of the lower thoracic vertebral body.
