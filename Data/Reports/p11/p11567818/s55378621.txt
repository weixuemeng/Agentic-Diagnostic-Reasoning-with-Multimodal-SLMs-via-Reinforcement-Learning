                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breast.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Left upper lobe opacity with a fiducial
 marker is consistent with the patient's known treated lung CA.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear with no evidence of pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  An ill-defined rounded opacity in the left lower lobe in the
 retrocardiac region only seen in the frontal view, is most likely
 superimposition of normal structures and shallow oblique views are recommended
 to exclude any lung nodule.
 
 Wedge-shaped deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is again noted.  IVC
 filter is again noted.
