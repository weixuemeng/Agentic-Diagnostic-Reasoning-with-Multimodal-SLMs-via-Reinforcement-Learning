                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is mild-to-moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta demonstrates calcifications particularly at
 the aortic knob.  Hilar contours are normal.  Streaky opacities are noted in
 the left upper lung field and right lung base.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is present, and partially imaged is an inferior vena cava filter within
 the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
 2.  Nonspecific ill-defined opacities within the left upper lung field and
 right lung base.  These could represent areas of infection, and radiographic
 followup is recommended after treatment to ensure resolution of these
 findings.  If these findings do not resolve, then a chest CT is recommended
 particularly for the left upper lung finding.
