                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tight aortic stenosis for TAVR.  // pulmonary
 edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mild to moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted within the aortic knob.  Mediastinal contour is
 otherwise unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Airspace opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified however the medial
 aspect of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin
 projecting over these regions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Probable bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
