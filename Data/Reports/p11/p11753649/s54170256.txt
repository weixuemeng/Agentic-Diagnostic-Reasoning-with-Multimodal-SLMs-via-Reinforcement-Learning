                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tachypnea. 
 
 STUDY:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are hyperinflated and lucent with
 flattened hemidiaphragms, compatible with severe COPD.  However, no lobar
 consolidation is present and minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted. 
 Pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are better evaluated on CT.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe COPD but no evidence of pneumonia.
