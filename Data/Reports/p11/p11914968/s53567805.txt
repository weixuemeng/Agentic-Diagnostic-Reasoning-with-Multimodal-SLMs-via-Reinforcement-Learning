                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p cardiac arrest, intubation, evaluate for acute
 process, tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm and outside field of view within the stomach.
 There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Low lung
 volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Minimally displaced
 right lateral fourth and fifth rib fractures and left posterior seventh rib
 fractures are likely related to recent chest compressions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or frank edema.
 2. Standard position of support devices.
 3. Bilateral minimally displaced rib fractures likely related to recent chest
 compressions.
