                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Six weeks of cough following URI with pleuritic chest pain, left
 posterior mid thoracic region.  Evaluate for infiltrate, rib fracture, pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  An opacity in the left lower lung
 obscures the left hemidiaphragm and is consistent with a left lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Ill-defined nodular opacities are suggested in the right lower
 lung, one of which may be the nipple shadow.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, nodular opacities in the right lower
 lung.  Recommend repeating routine PA and lateral chest radiograph with nipple
 markers in ___ weeks after resolution of pneumonia.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 ___ at 1:20 p.m. on ___.  Initial contact attempt was made at
