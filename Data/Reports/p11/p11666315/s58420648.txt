                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy and mucous plugging and cough. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Tracheostomy tube is identified in place,
 tip approximately 2 cm from the carina.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen.
 Left basilar streaky opacity is seen.  This could potentially be due to
 atelectasis although infection or aspiration is also possible.  Elsewhere the
 lungs are clear of consolidation.  There is no effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis noting infection or
 aspiration is not excluded.
