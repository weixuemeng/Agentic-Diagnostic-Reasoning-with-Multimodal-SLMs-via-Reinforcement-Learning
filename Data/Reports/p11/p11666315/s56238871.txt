                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension concerning for pneumonia.   
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Left subclavian central line terminates in
 the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are
 noted.  There is an opacity at the right lung base, at least part of which
 looks like is due to pleural fluid tracking along the fissure.  Medially, the
 opacity may represent focal atelectasis, but cannot rule out pneumonia or
 aspiration in the right clinical setting.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lung base opacity, which may represent atelectasis but cannot
 exclude pneumonia versus aspiration in the right clinical setting. 
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
