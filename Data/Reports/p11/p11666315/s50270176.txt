                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Previously reported pulmonary edema has partially resolved.  Persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis and adjacent moderate effusion.
 Layering right moderate pleural effusion appears slightly improved, but
 positional differences limit comparison.
