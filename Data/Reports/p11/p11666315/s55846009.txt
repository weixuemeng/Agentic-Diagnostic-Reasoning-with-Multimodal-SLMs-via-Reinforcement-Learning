                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is severely limited given patient
 motion.  As per technician note, the patient had great difficulty with
 positioning and following instructions.  Within this limitation, the heart is
 mildly enlarged.  There are perihilar opacifications which likely represent
 severe but improved pulmonary edema, though superimposed pneumonia is not
 excluded.  Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  Severe degenerative
 changes at the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severely limited examination.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Persistent but
 decreased perihilar opacification consistent with pulmonary edema.  Given
 degree of severity of edema cannot exclude superimposed pneumonia. Bilateral
 small pleural effusions.
