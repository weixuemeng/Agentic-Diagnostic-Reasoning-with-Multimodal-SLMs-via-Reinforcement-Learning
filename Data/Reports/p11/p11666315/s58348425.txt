                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post CABG, here with cellulitis, now with
 fever and tachycardia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There are persistent opacities in
 the bilateral bases, most likely atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia
 cannot be excluded. There has been interval improvement in the degree of
 interstitial pulmonary edema, which is now almost completely resolved. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The superior mediastinum remains enlarged,
 likely secondary to tortuous vessels. Tracheostomy tube ends 4.3 cm from the
 carina. Note is made of multiple very dilated loops of bowel in the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent opacities in the bilateral bases, most likely atelectasis, but
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Note is made of multiple very dilated loops of bowel in the upper abdomen.
