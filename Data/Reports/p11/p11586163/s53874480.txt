 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 pulmonary vasculature.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a subtle left perihilar
 consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.  Right lung is clear.  Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
