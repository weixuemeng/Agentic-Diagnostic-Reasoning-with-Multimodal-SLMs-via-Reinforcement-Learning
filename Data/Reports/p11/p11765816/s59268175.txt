                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subarachnoid hemorrhage, evaluate for
 infectious process.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film of ___ at 4:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central
 line are in unchanged position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable given the differences in patient rotation.  Lung volumes are lower with
 some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect areas of patchy atelectasis rather than pneumonia.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.
