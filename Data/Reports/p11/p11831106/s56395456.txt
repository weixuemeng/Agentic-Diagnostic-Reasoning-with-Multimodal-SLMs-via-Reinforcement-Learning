                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RLL consolidation  // PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Thoracic spine film from ___ and chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As seen on the thoracic spine films from earlier the same day there is severe
 volume loss in both lower lungs as seen by retrocardiac opacities.  The right
 mainstem bronchus in particular is deviated downward secondary to this volume
 loss however.  There has been some slight improved aeration in the right mid
 lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe volume loss more extensive on the right than on the left.
 Is unclear if this is all volume loss or if an underlying infiltrate is also
 present
