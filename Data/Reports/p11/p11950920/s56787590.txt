                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AVR decades ago, unknown if valve is
 mechanical or porcine  // mechanical vs porcine valve      mechanical vs
 porcine valve
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison studies. Please note that comparison to old films
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded and tortuous. There are
 scattered calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques consistent with prior
 asbestos exposure. No interstitial abnormality is appreciated to suggest
 asbestosis; however, if this is of clinical concern, dedicated chest CT would
 be more sensitive. The patient is status post median sternotomy with no
 evidence of a mechanical valve suggesting that a porcine valve is in place.
 Lungs are hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. More focal rounded
 nodular opacities in the left mid lung and right apex may reflect granulomata
 or pleural calcifications.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild
 vertebral compression fracture one of the lower thoracic vertebrae, the
 chronicity of which cannot be determined on this single radiograph.  Bones are
 osteopenic.
