                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sudden desaturation.  Please evaluate for endotracheal tube
 migration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to chest radiograph performed same day three
 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval migration of
 endotracheal tube into distal trachea at the level of the carina with
 subsequent minimally improved aeration of the otherwise collapsed right lower
 lung.  Stable left upper lobe opacity. The visualized cardiomediastinal and
 hilar borders are unchanged.  No left pleural effusion.
