                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturations, on vent, for placement of double-lumen tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed 9 hours earlier
 as well as CTA chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has again migrated upward with distal chamber
 terminating at the level of the carina.  The more proximal chamber appears to
 end at the level of the clavicles.  Linear lucencies identifed along the upper
 mediastinum as well as the right heart border suggests pneumomediastinum. 
 Please correlate with recent instrumentation.  Faint multifocal opacifications
 evident in the left lower lung and aerated portions of the right middle lung
 may represent edema versus hemorrhage.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
 Stable right lower lung colapse in a patient with preferential intubation of
 left lung.  Improved aeration of the left lower lung.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Upward migration of dual-chamber endotracheal tube with distal
 port in the trachea.  Findings suggestive of pneumomediastinum.  Correlate
 with recent surgical intervention.  Improved aeration of the left lung.
 
 Dr ___ discussed these findings with Dr ___ at 15:30 on
 ___ via telephone who confirms bronchcoscopy prior to chest
 radiograph.
