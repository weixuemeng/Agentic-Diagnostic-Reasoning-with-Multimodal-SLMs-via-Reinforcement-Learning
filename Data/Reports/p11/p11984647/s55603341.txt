                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LAVD  // eval for effusion/ edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has nearly
 resolved, and bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size.  Residual
 heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base may be due to a combination of
 resolving edema and atelectasis but continued radiographic followup would be
 helpful to exclude the possibility of underlying pneumonia.  A possible small
 right apical pneumothorax is difficult to assess due to superimposition of
 external structures in this region and may also be reassessed on short-term
 followup radiograph.
