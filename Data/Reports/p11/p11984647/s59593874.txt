  Grossly clear lungs, bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.9 cm above
  the level of the carina.  Right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter has been retracted,
  and now terminates in the vicinity of the main pulmonary artery.  Nasogastric
  tube courses inferior to the diaphragm and out of view of this radiograph. 
  Incompletely imaged catheter overlies the left thoracic inlet, and may
  represent a central venous line.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w cardiogenic shock (large MI) s/p IABP now s/p Centrimag
 LVAD ___  // please do upon arrival to CVICU
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. 
 The lungs are grossly clear.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, though evaluation is limited on this supine examination.
 
 Again noted is a Swan-Ganz catheter, retracted, now terminating in the region
 of the main pulmonary artery.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 5.5 cm above the carina.  The intra-aortic balloon pump terminates
 approximately 6 cm below the aortic knob.  The nasogastric tube is seen
 passing inferior to the diaphragm and is not completely appreciated on this
 examination.  A partially imaged left-sided introducer is new.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval retraction of IABP and Swan-Ganz catheter.
