                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with STEMI and cardiogenic shock, with concern
 for septic shock now with worsening respiratory failure // eval for pulm
 edema, balloon pump location, swan location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, pulmonary edema
 has worsened.  There are increased opacities most prominently in the right
 upper lung and left lower lung, possibly a combination of asymmetric and
 dependent edema due to mitral regurgitation and volume overload, developing
 pneumonia, or atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pleural
 effusions small, if any.  Tracheal stenosis may reflect complications of prior
 intubation or tracheostomy.  The intra-aortic balloon pump is unchanged in
 position, but approximately 3 cm superior to standard placement.  The
 Swan-Ganz central venous catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in
 the mid right descending pulmonary artery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased, moderate pulmonary edema.  An asymmetric, right upper lobe
 predominance may reflect mitral regurgitation.  Alternatively, there may be a
 developing right upper lobe and/or a left lower lobe pneumonia.
 Intra-aortic balloon pump unchanged in position, but 3 cm superior to standard
 placement.
