                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // eval for pulm edema      eval
 for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 08:02.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the intra-aortic pump balloon has migrated superiorly, less than a cm
 from the aortic apex.  This could be due to a change in patient positioning.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly stable.  Mild pulmonary edema worsened slightly, still
 more pronounced in the right upper lung.  This can sometimes be due to mitral
 regurgitation and is the likely diagnosis given transient consolidation in the
 right upper lobe on ___.  An alternative explanation is concurrent mild
 edema and developing pneumonia due to earlier aspiration.  Careful
 radiographic followup is advised.  .  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the midportion of the right descending pulmonary
 artery, and should be advanced no further.
