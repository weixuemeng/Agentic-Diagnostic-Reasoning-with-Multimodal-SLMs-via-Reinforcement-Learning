  Small right pleural effusion is stable compared to prior exam.  Right lower
  lung base consolidation likely represents moderate basilar atelectasis.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:55 AM
  Small right pleural effusion and mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged
  compared to prior exam.  Right lower lung base consolidation may represent
  asymmetric edema but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
  setting. The left lung is essentially clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with LVAD, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion is stable compared to prior exam.  Right lower
 lung base patchy opacity likely represents moderate basilar atelectasis.  The
 LVAD is in unchanged position.  A left pectoral pacemaker is seen with
 transvenous leads in the right ventricle.  The left lung is essentially clear.
 Heart size is moderately enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are intact and well
 aligned.  No pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank
 pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right pleural effusion is stable compared to prior exam.
 2. Right lower lung base patchy opacity likely represents moderate basilar
 atelectasis.
