 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVAD  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since 1 day prior, a a loculated right apical and lateral pleural effusion has
 decreased in size, a motor edema is decreased, and retrocardiac atelectasis is
 decreased.  A small, dependent right pleural effusion has probably increased
 in size.  The apices are incompletely visualized, but no obvious pneumothorax.
 Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening are unchanged.
 
 An ETT terminates 6.2 cm above the carina.  A left sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in the main pulmonary artery.  An enteric tube terminates in the
 proximal stomach.  Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains appear
 unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the moderate, loculated right pleural effusion and
 mild pulmonary edema.
