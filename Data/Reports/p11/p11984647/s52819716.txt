                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with STEMI and cardiogenic shock  // placement of
 endotracheal tube, any effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, bilateral lung
 opacities are improved.  Persistent right perihilar opacities may be due to
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, possibly mitral regurgitation.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 intra-aortic balloon pump has been withdrawn approximately 3 cm and is
 appropriately positioned.  The patient has been intubated and the ET tube
 terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Other support devices and
 lines are unchanged and appropriately positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial improvement in bilateral parenchymal opacities.  Persistent right
 perihilar opacities are likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
