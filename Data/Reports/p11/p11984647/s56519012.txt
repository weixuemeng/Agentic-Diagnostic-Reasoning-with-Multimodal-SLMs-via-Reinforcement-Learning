 the prior study.  There are 2 right-sided chest drains common the more
 superiorly positioned and drain approximates an apical right pleural effusion,
 this drain appears be bent back on itself.  Persistent airspace opacity in the
 right lung base has actually improved compared to the prior study.  The left
 lung appears grossly clear except note atelectasis in the left mid lung.

 Persistent right apical pleural effusion.  The more superior of the 2 chest
 drains closely approximates the fluid but appears to be bent back on itself.
