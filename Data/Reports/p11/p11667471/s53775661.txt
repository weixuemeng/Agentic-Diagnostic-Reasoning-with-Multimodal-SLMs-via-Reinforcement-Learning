                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Allowing for the difference in position of the patient, large left pleural
 effusion and small right pleural effusion are unchanged.  Cardiac size cannot
 be evaluated, probably enlarged.  Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate
 in the standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.  A focal opacity with focal bulge of pleural soft
 tissues adjacent to a destructive lesion in the lateral right seventh rib is
 again noted, as mentioned in prior study, this is worrisome for metastatic
 disease.
 
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
