                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Neck CT from ___ and multiple chest radiographs from
 ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pacer unit projects over the left chest with leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. 
 The mediastinal contours demonstrate mildly tortuous aorta with calcified
 atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The lungs demonstrate bibasilar
 atelectasis with small right and moderate left pleural effusions; this may
 represent a component of inflammatory reaction from rib lesions or the
 pathologic fracture seen at the left costophrenic angle.  Additionally, an
 area of lentiform pleural thickening is seen along the right mid chest wall in
 the area of a rib irregularity either representing a fracture or metastatic
 lesion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persisting right small and left moderate pleural effusions with
 associated atelectasis as well as pleural reaction adjacent to destructive
 bony lesions as described above.
