                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic thyroid cancer with Pleurx placement for left pleural
 effusion.  Now with minimal drainage from Pleurx.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A permanent pacemaker is in place in the left axillary position. 
 Pacemaker wires are in the proper position in the right and left atrium.  The
 Pleurx catheter is seen at the left base.  Since the prior radiograph, there
 has been a slight decrease in size of the left pleural effusion.  A small
 effusion persists.  The peripheral mass at the left base also appears to have
 slightly decreased in size.  Stable atelectasis is present at the left base. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion, unchanged from the prior exam.  A
 right pleural mass is also unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  There is no new consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Pleurx catheter in position at the
 left base with no reaccumulation of left pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable peripheral pleural-based metastases.
