 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV thyroid cancer, overgrowth on the left clavicle,
 evaluation for lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Pleural thickening, right pleural effusion that is associated with
 the thickening.  Areas of minimal scarring at both the right and the left
 lower lungs.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, very subtle, persists. 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  The soft tissues and the bony
 structures at the level of the clavicles look unremarkable.  However, a
 dedicated clavicular radiograph would be more sensitive technique to detect
 potential abnormalities.
