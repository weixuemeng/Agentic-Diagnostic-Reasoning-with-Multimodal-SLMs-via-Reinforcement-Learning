                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, likely the result of low
 lung volumes.  Additionally, patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which limit the assessment of the lung bases.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
