                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia during left transbronchial biopsy.  Please evaluate for
 pneumothorax.

 ___ and PET-CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates a large rounded
 opacity in the left lower lung, correlating with known left lung mass, better
 visualized on the ___ PET-CT.  No focal opacification concerning
 for pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectasis is evident.  Coarse linear interstitial
 markings in left upper lobe may reflect emphysematous change. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Prominent pericardial fat pads are evident;
 otherwise, cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Large left lower lobe mass, better evaluated on
 prior CT.
