                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left thoracotomy and
 left upper lobectomy for lung cancer, assessment after chest tube
 discontinuation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance including left mediastinal
 shift, expected.  No evidence of pneumothorax or interval increase of pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  Post-sternotomy wires appear unchanged including
 two upper broken wires.  The chronic interstitial changes are unchanged as
 well.
