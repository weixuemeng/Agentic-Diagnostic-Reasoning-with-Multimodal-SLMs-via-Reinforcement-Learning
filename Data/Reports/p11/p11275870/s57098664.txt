 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:03 AM
  1.  Opacity in the right lower lobe could be compatible with pneumonia in the
  right clinical setting.
  
  2. Small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.
  
 WET READ VERSION #___ ___ ___ ___ 4:56 AM
  1. Small right pleural effusion.
  
  2. Irregular linear opacities in the right lower lobe likely represent
  atelectasis. An underlying infectious process is less likely given clinical
  history.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cp  // eval for ptx/pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is a new focal confluent opacity in the right lower lobe and an
 approximately 1 cm poorly defined nodular opacity in the left mid lung the
 fourth anterior rib level.  Linear opacities in the right lower lobe likely
 represent scarring.  There is a small right pleural effusion versus pleural
 thickening.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to
 scout images from CTA chest ___.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries are
 suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Confluent opacity in the right lower lobe could be compatible with
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  1 cm poorly defined nodular
 opacity in left mid lung could potentially be infectious or neoplastic and is
 without correlate on prior CTA.  Follow-up chest radiographs are recommended
 in ___ weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution.
 
 2. Small right pleural effusion vs pleural thickening and adjacent linear
 scar.
