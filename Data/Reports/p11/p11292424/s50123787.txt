                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There are increased streaky
 opacities at the bilateral bases which likely represent atelectasis, however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Perihilar prominence of vessels
 suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased streaky opacities at the bilateral bases which likely represent
 atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Perihilar prominence of vessels suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement.
