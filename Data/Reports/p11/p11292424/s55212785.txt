 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels,
 which could reflect elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Of incidental
 note is a calcification in the left lower neck, consistent with thyroid
 adenoma.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
