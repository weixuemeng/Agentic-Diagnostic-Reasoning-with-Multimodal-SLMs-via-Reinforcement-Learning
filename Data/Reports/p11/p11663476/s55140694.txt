 INDICATION:  History: ___F with diffuse chest wall tenderness on right side of
 chest primarily posteriorly.  // Rib fractures?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.

 Please note that if high clinical concern for rib fracture persists, dedicated
 rib series with bb marker over site of pain or chest CT is more sensitive.
