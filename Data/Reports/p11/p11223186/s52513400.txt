                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Right-sided calcified
 pleural plaques again may reflect the sequela of prior infection or
 hemothorax, unchanged, and somewhat limits assessment of the underlying
 pulmonary parenchyma.  Streaky right basilar opacity could reflect
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion is new in the interval with fluid
 noted in the minor fissure.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Assessment of the right lung parenchyma is limited by the presence of
 calcified pleural plaques, as seen previously, and may be the sequela prior
 infection or hemothorax.
 2. Streaky right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection is
 not excluded.  Small right pleural effusion.
