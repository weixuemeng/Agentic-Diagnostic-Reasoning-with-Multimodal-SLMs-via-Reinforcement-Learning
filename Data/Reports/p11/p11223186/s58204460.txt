                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough, recent pna  // worsening pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and chronic change noted
 at the right mid to lower hemi thorax, with pleural calcification, better seen
 on recent prior CT from ___.  Subtle patchy opacity at the
 lateral left lung base may be due to overlap of structures although a small
 focus of consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle patchy opacity at the lateral left lung base on the AP view may be due
 to overlap of structures although small focus of consolidation is difficult to
 exclude.  Please note that no evidence of lobar pneumonia was seen on chest CT
 from ___.  Chronic change at the right mid to lower hemi thorax.
