                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph. .
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  Chest CT
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well-expanded. Again seen is
 an irregular increased density along the right lateral lower chest, consistent
 with calcified pleural plaques, seen on prior chest CT.  Two new areas in the
 right upper lung.  On the lateral view there is correlate of opacity
 projecting over the right upper lobe making the suspicious for parenchymal
 opacity.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities projecting over the right lung secondary to known pleural plaques. 
 There are however new regions of opacity projecting over the right upper lobe
 which are suspicious for superimposed infection.
