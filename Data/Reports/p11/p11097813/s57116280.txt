                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain with new oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacities at
 the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis.  Probable left lateral prior rib
 fractures are identified inferiorly.  There is also evidence of biapical
 scarring.  There is no large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Several densities seen in the left suprahilar region and
 projecting over the anterior first left rib.  These could be costochondral
 calcifications; however, two-view chest x-ray is suggested to further
 characterize when patient is amenable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Vague opacities projecting over the left upper lung medially,
 potentially costochondral calcifications; however, dedicated chest x-ray with
 two views is suggested when patient is amenable.
