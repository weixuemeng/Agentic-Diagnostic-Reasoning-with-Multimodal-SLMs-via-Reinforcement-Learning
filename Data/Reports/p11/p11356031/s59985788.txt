                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer history with shortness of breath, assess for
 pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a stable
 opacity at the left lung base which is compatible with pleural effusion in
 this patient with history of prior left lower lobe resection.  Overall
 appearance is stable without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Suture material is also noted in the left upper lung.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post left lower lobe resection with left pleural effusion,
 similar to prior exam.
