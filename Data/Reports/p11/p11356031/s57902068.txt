  Interval increase in left pleural effusion and likely overlying atelectasis.
  Left retrocardia opacity with obscuration of hemidiaphragm persists and is
  likely due to volume loss.  Right lung clear. Port catheter at cavoatrial
  junction. Splenic artery coil seen in left upper quadrant.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at the left base extending along the lateral chest wall, consistent with
 pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.  The cardiac
 silhouette is somewhat more prominent and there is some indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Port-A-Cath is unchanged.
 
 Of incidental note are splenic artery coils in the left upper quadrant.
