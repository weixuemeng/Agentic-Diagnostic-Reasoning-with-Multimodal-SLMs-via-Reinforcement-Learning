                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with comparison to
 the examination performed one day previously.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter is present, with the tip in
 the region of the caval-atrial junction.  There appear to be two left-sided
 basilar chest tubes.  There is probably a persistent small left pleural
 effusion, unchanged since the prior examination.  Surgical ___ at the left
 lung apex are again seen.  No new pulmonary opacities, or evidence of
 recurrence/worsening pneumothorax/pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Minimal interval change since the prior examination.  The previously described
 left apical residual pneumothorax is not clearly seen on this examination.
