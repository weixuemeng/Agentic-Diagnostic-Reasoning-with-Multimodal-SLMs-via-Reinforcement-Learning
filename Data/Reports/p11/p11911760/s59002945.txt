                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:37 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia after knee surgery.  Question atelectasis infiltrate or
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Wedge-shaped areas of opacity at both lung bases, are generally due to
 atelectasis, but these plain radiographic findings neither specifically
 suggest nor exclude the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Mediastinal
 convexity in the region of this ascending thoracic aorta or azygous vein is
 new since ___, but should be corroborated with conventional chest radiographs
 when feasible, to see if additional imaging is necessary.
 
 Upper lungs are clear and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.
