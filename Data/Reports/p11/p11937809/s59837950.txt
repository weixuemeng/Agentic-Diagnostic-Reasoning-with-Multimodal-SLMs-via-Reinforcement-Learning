                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased pneumothorax on waterseal, now back on suction.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:14 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the pneumothorax at the right lung base has
 decreased considerably in size.  However, a significant pneumothorax remains
 visible there.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
