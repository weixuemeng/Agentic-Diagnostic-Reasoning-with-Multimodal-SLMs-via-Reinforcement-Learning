                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic lung cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip down the right mainstem
 bronchus.  On second exposure, it is slightly retracted but remains at the
 carina.  There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with some
 residual aerated lung at the left lung apex.  The right lung demonstrates more
 significant consolidation superiorly compared to prior.  Multiple right-sided
 pulmonary nodules are again noted as well as calcification left suprahilar
 region, also compatible with known metastatic disease.  Left chest wall
 Port-A-Cath is seen with tip at the RA-SVC junction.  Nasogastric tube seen
 with tip in the gastric body.  No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube at the carina, this had already been withdrawn at the
 time of interpretation of the study per Dr. ___.  
 2.  Near complete opacification of the left lung compatible with components of
 both secondary atelectasis and likely underlying effusion.
 3.  Increased opacity at the right upper lung could represent progression of
 obstructive pneumonia.
