                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath.  Chest tube to suction.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 A right pigtail catheter is again seen medially at the base of the right lung.
 There is a large pneumothorax at the base of the right lung, larger than on
 ___.  The lung is retracted superiorly, with chain sutures noted at the
 inferior edge of the lung.  Again seen is a dense patchy opacity in the right
 upper zone which is apparently longstanding and similar to the prior film. 
 Also again seen is a small nodular opacity in the lower portion of the
 retracted right lung, unchanged.  There is a small-to-moderate left effusion,
 slightly larger, with patchy opacity in the mid and lower zones of the left
 lung.  The parenchymal opacities appear slightly improved.  A left-sided
 indwelling catheter is present, with lead tip over the SVC/RA junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively largepneumothorax at the base of the right lung,
 larger than on ___.  Right-sided pleural catheter appears unchanged.
 
 Please see report of follow-up film which shows interval improvement in the
 ptx.
