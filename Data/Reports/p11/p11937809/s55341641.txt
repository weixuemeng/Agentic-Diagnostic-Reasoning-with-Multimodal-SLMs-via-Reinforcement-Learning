                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent homogeneous opacity involving the right upper lobe with
 associated volume loss, likely due to combination of post-obstructive
 atelectasis and pneumonia as reported on recent CT.  Bilateral pulmonary
 nodules are again demonstrated, as well as multifocal consolidation, most
 confluent in the left mid and lower lung regions and more patchy in the
 remaining portions of the lungs.  Overall, this process has slightly improved
 since the previous radiograph.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged as
 well as postoperative changes in the right hemithorax related to previous
 wedge resections.  Subdiaphragmatic gas collection corresponds to extensive
 free intraperitoneal air on recent CT of the abdomen of ___.
