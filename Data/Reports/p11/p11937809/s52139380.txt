                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lung, admitted
 for right upper lung pneumonia, now with volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the
 patient in upright position.
 
 Compared to study from ___, there has been no significant interval
 change.  Again seen is the right upper lobe opacity with associated volume
 loss.  There are persistent bilateral pulmonary nodules as well as multifocal
 consolidation.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is persistent pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right upper lobe opacity, likely reflective of post-obstructive
 atelectasis and pneumonia as seen on prior chest CT. 
 
 2.  Stable bilateral pulmonary nodules and multifocal consolidation, most
 prominent in the left mid and lower lung fields.
 
 3.  Persistent pneumoperitoneum.
