 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:57 PM
  Status post left chest tube placement with decrease in left pleural effusion,
  small amount of fluid remaining.  Stable right upper lobe dense consolidation.
  Endotracheal TUBE approximately 1.7 cm from the carina and may be retracted
  for better positioning.  Nasogastric tube, right internal jugular central line
  and left subclavian central line in appropriate positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:51 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Left pleural effusion.  Following
 chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 3:05 p.m.:
 
 Most of the opacification in the left hemithorax resolved following
 re-positioning of the endotracheal tube from the right main bronchus to the
 distal trachea.  Currently, the tip is no more than 15 mm above the carina,
 and it should be withdrawn another 15 mm for appropriate positioning.  A new
 left basal thin-bore pleural drain has been inserted, and only a small volume
 of left pleural fluid remains.  Right upper lobe is still collapsed.  There
 are numerous metastases in both lungs.  The small right pleural effusion is
 stable.  Heart is grossly normal size.  Both a left subclavian infusion port
 and right internal jugular line end in the region of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.
