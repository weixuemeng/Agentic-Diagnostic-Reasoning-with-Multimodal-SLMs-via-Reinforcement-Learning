                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset pneumothorax status post chest tube to waterseal, question
 interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at ___:___ p.m.
 
 A wet reading was provided by radiology resident, Dr. ___ as follows:
 "Redevelopment of moderately large right basilar pneumothorax after chest tube
 was placed on waterseal.  Discussed with ___ ___, M.D. at 3:___ p.m.
 via telephone."
 
 As suggested on the wet reading, although the right chest tube is in place,
 the relatively large pneumothorax at the right lung base has recurred, with
 some collapse and an upward retraction of the right lung.  Lucencies at the
 right lung apex and right perihilar region may also reflect areas of
 pneumothorax.  Chain sutures in the right paratracheal region and along the
 inferior edge of the lung laterally are again noted.  Nodular densities int he
 right lung are also again noted.  
 
 On the left, the overall appearance is similar, with possible slight
 improvement in opacities in the left mid zone, but persistent patchy opacities
 throughout the lung and a persistent left effusion.  Of note, there is only
 minimal patient rotation on the current exam and there may be slight leftward
 shift of the mediastinum. The etiology for this is uncertain.  No clear
 component of tension pneumothorax is seen on the right. If real, this
 mediasitnal shift could reflect some interval volume loss in the left chest,
 but there is no definite worsening of atelectasis on the left side.
 
 Left indwelling catheter with tip over distal SVC near SVC/RA junction again
 noted.  No left-sided pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval recurrence of relatively large pneumothorax at the right lung,
 predominantly at the right lung base, after chest tube placed on  waterseal.
 
 2.  Left lung largely unchanged, but note is made of possible slight interval
 leftward shift of the mediastinum.  Clinical correlation and attention to this
 area on followup films is requested.
