                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with heart failure s/p diuresis  // pulmonary
 edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated on today's study, this limits assessment.  A
 dual lead pacemaker appears to be unchanged in position.  A right-sided PICC
 terminates in the mid SVC.  The appearance of increased opacity in the right
 lung is likely in part due to projection, in part due to layering pleural
 effusion.  The left lung appears grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, there has been no significant interval
 change.
