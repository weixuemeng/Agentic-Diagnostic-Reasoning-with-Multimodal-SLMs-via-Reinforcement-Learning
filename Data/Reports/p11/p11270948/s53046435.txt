                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and wheezing for several days.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 There is persistence of the region of mild peribronchial opacification in the
 right lower lung seen laterally on the frontal view, not clearly localized on
 the lateral.  It is not abnormal enough to characterize as pneumonia, but if
 there is high clinical suspicion of pneumonia, an additional radiographic
 confirmation is needed and oblique view should be obtained.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, but there is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or vascular
 engorgement.
