                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting for evaluation of a fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph on ___, there is worsening
 moderate effusion and adjacent atelectasis on the right.  Opacification of the
 left lung base is likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart borders are difficult to assess due to adjacent effusions.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.  Pacer leads appropriately terminate in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Probable
 effusion on the left.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
