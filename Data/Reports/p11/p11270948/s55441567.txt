                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, recent CXR with possible pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating
 in the regions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists and mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Haziness within the right lung base likely reflects a layering small
 right pleural effusion.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small layering right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
