                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with leukocytosis and fever  // Assess for
 pulmonary edema and effusions. Assess for infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal shadow is normal.  There is a linear confluent airspace
 opacification (most likely atelectasis) seen in the basal aspect of the right
 lung with an associated effusion.  Smaller left-sided effusion with adjacent
 subsegmental atelectasis.  The upper lung zones are clear.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Spondylotic changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with this adjacent atelectatic changes
 (right more than left).  Although I favor atelectasis to explain the airspace
 opacification in the right lung base, pneumonia cannot be excluded with
 absolute certainty.
