                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with chronic trach  // eval for trach placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy project over the upper trachea.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Increased opacity projecting over the left hemithorax compared
 to the right is compatible with persistent large pleural effusion.  More dense
 retrocardiac opacity is noted, potentially from the effusion and atelectasis
 noting that infection would certainly be possible.  There is also a suspected
 persistent right pleural effusion.  Right PICC is identified although tip of
 the catheters not clearly delineated.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of the chest when compared to ___ with
 persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
