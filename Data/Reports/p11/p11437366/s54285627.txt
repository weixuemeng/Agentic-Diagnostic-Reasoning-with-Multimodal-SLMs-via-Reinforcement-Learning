                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC, concern for malpositioning  // Does
 PICC need to be repositioned?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen a right-sided PICC line whose most medial aspect projects
 over the superior border of the right clavicle, with tip not well visualized.
 It is recommended to repeat chest x-ray to confirm tip location.
 
 There is a poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.  Median sternotomy
 wires are again visualized.
 
 Allowing for changes due to rotation and positioning, there is no appreciable
 interval change in the mediastinal silhouette.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unable to be evaluated secondary to patient positioning.
 
 There is interval increase in opacification of bilateral lower lung zones,
 which is likely due to poor patient positioning, as well as low lung
 volumes/poor inspiratory effort. This also limits evaluation of interval
 changes in previously visualized bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right-sided PICC line with distal tip not well visualized. Recommend
 repeat imaging for clarification of tip location. Otherwise, poor patient
 positioning and low lung volumes significantly limits this study.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings regarding the right-sided PICC line position
 were discussed over the phone with IV nurse ___ on ___ at 15:13. It
 was recommended to obtain repeat chest x-ray to confirm tip position.
