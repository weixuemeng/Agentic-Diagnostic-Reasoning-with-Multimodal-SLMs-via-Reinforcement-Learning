                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  Question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.
 
 There is patchy opacity projecting over the heart on the frontal view, not
 seen on the lateral.  In conjunction with older films this is thought to be
 related to costochondral calcification.  The lungs are hyperinflated but
 otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting post-operative changes from
 median sternotomy and mediastinal clips and dual-lead pacing device in stable
 position.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
