                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath postpartum.  Rule out
 heart failure or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes likely accentuate the vasculature as well as the
 heart size which on this AP film is top normal, but may be exaggerated due to
 the technique.  The lungs are clear of focal opacities concerning for
 infection.  No pleural effusion is present.  Again, the vasculature is
 accentuated which is likely due to low lung volumes, however, edema can be
 considered.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited AP view of the chest with low lung volumes, but no focal
 consolidations.  Possible edema.  Suggest a PA and lateral view of the chest
 if the patient can tolerate with better inspiratory effort to differentiate
 pathology versus normal findings.
