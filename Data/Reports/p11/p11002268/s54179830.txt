                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post thoracocentesis of
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding AP single view chest examination of ___.  The right-sided
 recently performed thoracocentesis has been successful and as much as the
 pleural effusion blunting the right lateral pleural sinus has been reduced. 
 Mild blunting, however, persists.  Similar as on the preceding examination,
 there are no gross pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, but local linear
 densities are suggestive of some remaining plate atelectasis in the area.  No
 new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  The most prominent abnormality,
 however, remains.  The rather marked widening of the superior and mid
 mediastinal structures which on FDG tumor imaging procedure (PET/CT) of ___, identified enlarged and extensive mediastinal tumor with enlargement
 of mediastinal nodes.  Plain chest x-ray does not demonstrate any significant
 interval change, and no pneumothorax is seen on either side.
