                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with lymphoma status post CPOC now with fevers.
 Assess for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a right lower lobe opacity with an
 associated moderate effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contour show  fullness consistent with
 extensive lymphadenopathy.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe opacity with an associated effusion, likely represents a
 moderate effusion with associated atelectasis; however, superinfection cannot
 be excluded.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy better seen on recent
 PET-CT.
