                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  Respiratory
 motion slightly limits evaluation of this exam.  The heart size appears mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are somewhat prominent, but this likely is
 accentuated by the low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  No overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Streaky opacities in the perihilar regions may reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to respiratory motion and low lung volumes.  No
 overt pulmonary edema identified. Probably bilateral perihilar atelectasis.
