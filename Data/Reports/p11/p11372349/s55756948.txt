                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and altered mental status, now intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:44
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3
 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube is present, however, the tube is not
 seen beyond the mid esophageal region.  There are persistently low lung
 volumes.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip in standard position.  Nasogastric tube can
 only be visualized to the level of the mid esophageal region.  Please note
 that subsequent CT of the torso demonstrates a nasogastric tube tip to lie
 within the stomach.
