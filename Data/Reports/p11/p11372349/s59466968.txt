                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 10:14 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable supine image of the chest was obtained.  A new
 right subclavian central venous line is present with the tip terminating at
 the atriocaval junction.  An endotracheal tube is in place, approximately 3 cm
 from the carina.  An orogastric tube is present and courses below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of the field-of-view.  The lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating the pulmonary vascular markings and the cardiac size.  In
 comparison to the prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. 
 Hazy bilateral basilar opacification is likely atelectasis.  There is no
 evidence of consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The size
 of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian central venous line terminating at the atriocaval
 junction.
 2.  Bilbasilar atelectasis.
