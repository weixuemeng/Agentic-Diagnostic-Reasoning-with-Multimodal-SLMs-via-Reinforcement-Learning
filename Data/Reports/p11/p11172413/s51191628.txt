                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a single lead pacemaker terminating in the right ventricle.  The
 heart appears moderately enlarged.  Superior vena cava shows new mild
 distention.  There is also a new bilateral hilar congestion.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Mild interstitial
 process suggest pulmonary edema.  Left posterior basilar opacity was present
 before but increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Increased left posterior
 basilar opacity, likely compatible with atelectasis; it is difficult to
 exclude pneumonia, however.
