                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, hypoxia  // Eval for pulmonary edema     
 Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral AICD has a single lead in unchanged position. The inspiratory
 lung volumes are decreased with resultant accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The
 mediastinal contours are stable. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with
 increased bibasilar opacities from the prior study suggesting increased
 dependent pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased pulmonary vascular congestion and dependent bibasilar edema compared
 to ___. No significant pleural effusion. Stable cardiomegaly.
