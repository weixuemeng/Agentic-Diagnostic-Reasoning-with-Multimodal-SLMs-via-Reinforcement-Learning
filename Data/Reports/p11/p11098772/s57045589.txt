 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There are chunky calcified lymph
 nodes in the central mediastinum as well as two small calcified granulomas
 projecting over the left mid lung.  A very small calcified granuloma is also
 noted at the left lung apex and there is potentially one or more tiny
 calcified nodules in the right upper lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small parenchymal granulomas and chunky calcified lymph nodes,
 suggesting prior granulomatous exposure.
