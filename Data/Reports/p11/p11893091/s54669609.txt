                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with worsening shortness of breath, question
 infectious process, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 1:11 a.m.
 
 PA and lateral views dated ___ at 11:03 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There continues to be bilateral interstitial process, but this has
 improved since the prior study, and is more similar to baseline of ___,
 therefore, likely reflecting chronic age-related or small airways changes. 
 More focal patchy opacity at the left base likely reflects compressive
 atelectasis given the pleural effusion, although pneumonia can not be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
