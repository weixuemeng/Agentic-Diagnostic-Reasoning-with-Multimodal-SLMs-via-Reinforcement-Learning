                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with syncope.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated, accounting for some vascular
 crowding, but there are no focal opacities.  There is moderate to severe
 cardiac enlargement which might represent cardiomegaly versus moderate
 pericardial effusion. Of note, the vascular pedicle is slightly widened,
 suggesting hemodynamic compromise.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac sillhouete might represent moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion. The association of these findings
 with a widened vascular pedicle raises concern for hemodynamic compromise from
 increased right heart pressure.
 
 These findings were communicated by Dr ___ ___ telephone to Dr ___ on
 ___ at 8 am, immediately after discussion of the findings with Dr ___.
