                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough and chest pain in right upper
 thorax.  Smoker, assess for infiltrate or other abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and
 remains within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is identified. 
 Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Similar as
 observed on the preceding examination, the diaphragms are in relatively low
 position and appear flattened, a finding suggestive of COPD.  Again, acute or
 new infiltrates cannot be identified.  The lateral view discloses again
 moderate degree of degenerative changes in the thoracic spine, mostly in the
 lower half, but there is no evidence of any vertebral body compression
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no acute pulmonary infiltrates, no
 suspicious mass lesions.  General findings suggestive of COPD.
