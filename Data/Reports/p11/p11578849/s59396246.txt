                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:39.  Additionally, chest CTA from earlier the
 same date, ___ at 17:33.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient appears somewhat kyphotic in position.  There are bibasilar opacities
 which are likely due to atelectasis or even aspiration.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  Left base retrocardiac opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis as seen on preceding CT.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis as seen on
 shortly preceding CT.  No overt pulmonary edema.
