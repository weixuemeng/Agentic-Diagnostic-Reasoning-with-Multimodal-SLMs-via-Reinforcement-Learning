                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with atrial fibrillation and rapid
 ventricular response, found to have a left-sided pleural effusion.  Better
 evaluation of pleural effusion.
 
 The patient's condition required examination in sitting position using AP,
 frontal and left lateral views.  Now analysis is performed in direct
 comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___.  On the AP frontal views, the findings are grossly unchanged.  Thus,
 status post sternotomy and mitral valve replacement as well as permanent pacer
 on left side with dual intracavitary electrode system, unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vascular pattern has improved in comparison and can be identified in the
 accessible right hemithorax.  No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified in this area and the right lateral pleural sinus is free.  Hazy
 density on the left base persists and obliterates the diaphragmatic contour. 
 Pleural fluid density reaches along the left lateral chest wall up to the
 hilar region.  On the lateral view, the left-sided posterior pleural sinus
 shows evidence of pleural effusion, which is deemed to be of moderate amount. 
 Unless required for diagnostic purposes, thoracocentesis is unlikely to be
 required as the amount does not significantly meet pulmonary respiratory
 function.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
