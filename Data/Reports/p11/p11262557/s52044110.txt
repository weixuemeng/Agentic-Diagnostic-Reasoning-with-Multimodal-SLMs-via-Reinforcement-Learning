 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // Acute cardiopulm disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Right PICC line terminates in
 the low SVC. Feeding tube extends into the upper abdomen though the tip is not
 in the imaged field. Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valves
 are again seen. Moderate pulmonary edema is again seen with partially laying
 small right pleural effusion. Lateralizing opacity in the left mid lung could
 represent loculated pleural fluid or pleural thickening. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable. No large pneumothorax. An azygous fissure is noted.
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, partially layering right pleural effusion. PICC line
 and feeding tube in place.
