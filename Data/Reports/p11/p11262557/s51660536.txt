  Endotracheal tube is 5.2 cm above the carinal. Right PICC is at the cavoatrial
  junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged since prior exam allowing
  for positional rotation. Cardiomegaly is severe. There is mild pulmonary
  vascular congestion similar to the previous study. No pneumothorax or pleural
  effusions.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ET tube and hypoxemia  // confirm

 confirm position of ET tube, evaluate for causes of hypoxemi
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
