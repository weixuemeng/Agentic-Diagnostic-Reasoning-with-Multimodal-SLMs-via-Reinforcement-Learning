 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w SBO ___ incarcerated incisional hernia s/p ex lap, LOA,
 skin closure (fascia open) (___)  // evaluate NGT placement     evaluate NGT
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the tip of the enteric tube is
 difficult to assess.  It extends into the stomach, though overlying soft
 tissue obscures the course of the tube.  If the precise position is of
 clinical importance, a view including the upper in mid abdomen using abdominal
 technique could be obtained.
 The left hemidiaphragm is no longer sharply seen, suggesting some pleural
 fluid with compressive atelectasis at the left base.
