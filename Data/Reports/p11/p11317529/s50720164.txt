                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain after
 seizure.  Please evaluate for pneumothorax or rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is
 seen; however, if clinical concern for rib fracture persists, suggest
 dedicated rib series.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen; however, if clinical concern for rib fracture persists, recommend
 dedicated rib series with BB marker overlying site of pain, which is more
 sensitive.
