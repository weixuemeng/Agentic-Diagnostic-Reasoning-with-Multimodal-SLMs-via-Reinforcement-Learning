 infiltrates, volume status

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval replacement of the nasogastric tube with a feeding tube which has the
 distal end projecting over the stomach.  Right internal jugular central line
 unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged given patient rotation. Slightly increased opacity at both bases,
 right greater than left, suggestive of worsening atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax. Probable small layering pleural effusions.
