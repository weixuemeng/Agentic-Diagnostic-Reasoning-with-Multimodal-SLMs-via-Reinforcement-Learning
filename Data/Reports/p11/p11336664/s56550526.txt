                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypotension. Assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube, right IJ central line, and ET tube remain in satisfactory
 position.  There is a stable degree of rightward deviation of the right IJ
 central line, which is presumed to be secondary to prominent vascularity. New
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely due to a small pleural
 effusion. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is also unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax. Right shoulder degenerative changes are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 New small left pleural effusion.
 Lines and tubes remain in satisfactory position.
