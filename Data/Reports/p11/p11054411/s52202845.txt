                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Line pulled back, assess placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:23 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right IJ central line tip has been retracted
 and now lies at the level of the SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Incidental note is
 made of a widened right AC joint and tapered distal clavicle, ? related to
 prior surgery.
