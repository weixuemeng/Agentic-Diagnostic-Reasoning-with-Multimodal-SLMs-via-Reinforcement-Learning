                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis, increasing O2 requirement, question edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:47 a.m.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Compared to the prior film, the right IJ line appears
 to have been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are new small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution.  Increased opacity in the
 right lung raises the question of asymmetric CHF.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is more prominent. While it may be larger than on the prior film,
 this appearance is likely also considerably accentuated by differences in
 technique, as today's film was obtained portably, with lordotic positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Upper zone redistribution suggests the presence of CHF.  The
 possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
