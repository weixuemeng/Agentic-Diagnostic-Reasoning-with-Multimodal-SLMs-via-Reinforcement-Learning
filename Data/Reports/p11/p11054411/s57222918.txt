                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe pancreatitis and chest pain.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Bibasilar ill-defined opacities are
 present, more conspicuous in the right lower lung in a paramediastinal
 location, with mild peribronchovascular thickening in these areas.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are grossly unremarkable, allowing for slight high positioning of the aortic
 knob, unchanged, and probable scattered atherosclerotic calcification. Note is
 made of an old healed left posterior rib fracture and ? old healed right ___
 rib fx. No obvious acute rib fxs detected on these lung technique films. 
 
 A right-sided IJ line ends in the right atrium, approximately 5 cm below the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, right worse than left, suggestive of pneumonia versus
 aspiration.
 
 2.  IJ line ends in the right atrium.  Withdrawal of approximately 5 cm is
 recommended for placement in the lower superior vena cava.
 
 3.  No gross pleural effusion identified. A small effusion might not be
 apparent on this view.
