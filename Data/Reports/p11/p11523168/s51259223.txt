 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, evaluation for fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pneumonia has substantially improved, with resulting decrease and near
 complete resolution of the pre-existing opacity at the right lung base.  The
 pre-existing right pleural effusion is also completely resolved.  Minimal
 atelectasis persists at the right lung bases but no new opacities have
 occurred in the interval.  Low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly without
 pulmonary edema.
