                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP Portable supine chest film
 
 INDICATION:   History: ___M with intubation, need to assess tube placement
 after transport.  // eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 09:20 is submitted.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT thoracic spine dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the level of the
 carina. Lung volumes are extremely low leading to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. Multiple airspace opacities overlying the right
 mid and lower lung correlate with consolidation seen on recent CT. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size is difficult to assess
 given low lung volumes and patient positioning, but appears mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminating 5 cm above the carina.
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Multifocal airspace opacities in the right middle and
 lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration versus pneumonia, and correlate with
 consolidations identified on recent CT examination.
