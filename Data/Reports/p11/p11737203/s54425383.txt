                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for acute process in a patient with cough/productive
 sputum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly low lung volumes
 with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged.  The is minimally unfolded. 
 Increased opacity or they lower lobe on the lateral view likely represents
 artifact due to underpenetration and multiple overlapping the anatomic
 structures.  Allowing for this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The visualized upper abdomen is grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate.
