                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, presenting with fever.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  Nipple shadows are visible bilaterally.  Opacity
 projecting over posterior lower lungs on the lateral view is probably due to
 stable atelectasis in the medial right lower lobe, as seen previously.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
