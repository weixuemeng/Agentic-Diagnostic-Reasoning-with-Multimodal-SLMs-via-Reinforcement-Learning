                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:04 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with AVM, to undergo craniotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.  Previous diffuse pulmonary
 abnormality, either pneumonia or edema, has resolved.  Lungs are now clear. 
 Heart size is normal.  Left pulmonary artery is enlarged and tapers abruptly
 just above the cardiac silhouette.  This raises concern for pulmonary
 embolism.  It may also help to explain distention of the azygos vein, although
 I do not see right heart dilatation.  There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m.
