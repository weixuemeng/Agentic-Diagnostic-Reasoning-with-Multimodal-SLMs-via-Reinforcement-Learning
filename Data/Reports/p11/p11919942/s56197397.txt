                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  Mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta is noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is minimally prominent. 
 Streaky left mid and lower lung opacities are probably compatible with minor
 atelectasis, but there is also a vague retrocardiac opacity.  There is more
 widespread but patchy opacification involving the right lower lung, probably
 in the right middle lobe, raising concern for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting although lower airway inflammation, atelectasis or even
 aspiration are other etiologies that could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Although there is perhaps minimal vascular prominence,
 since opacities are focal in the lower lungs, pulmonary edema is doubted as
 the primary etiology but could be seen with an atypical pattern.
