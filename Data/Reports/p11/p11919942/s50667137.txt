                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 including the most recent study from ___.  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  There are
 heterogeneous opacities at both lung bases, left greater than right, possibly
 due to atelectasis, although an infectious process is possible.  Interstial
 opacification suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart size is
 top normal, as before.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities, left greater than right, possibly
 atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  Clinical correlation
 recommended.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
