                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SBo complain new acute ___ abd pain  //
 Please perform upright CXR, eval free air under diaphragm
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No free air is detected beneath diaphragm.  Air seen under the left
 hemidiaphragm is more suggestive of gas within the gastric fundus or, less
 likely, within a splenic flexure.  A few air-filled loops of bowel are seen in
 the lower abdomen.  These could represent mildly dilated loops of small bowel,
 possibly with fluid levels, but are not fully evaluated on this examination. 
 The prominent - this distention seen in the upper abdomen on the film from ___ is not appreciated on the current upright film.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or fusion.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is moderate sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, right convex
 lower thoracic and left convex in the upper lumbar spine, with a rotary
 component lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. No free air detected beneath the diaphragm.
 3. Possible mildly dilated loops of bowel in lower abdomen.  Please see
 comment above.
 If there is ongoing concern for free air within the abdomen, then further
 assessment with decubitus views or alternatively, cross-sectional imaging
 would be recommended.
