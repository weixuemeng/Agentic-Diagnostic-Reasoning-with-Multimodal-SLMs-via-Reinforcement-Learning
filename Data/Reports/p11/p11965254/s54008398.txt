                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p NG tube // eval for NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an enteric tube with distal tip projecting over the approximate
 location of the gastric body with the side-port seen distal to the GE
 junction.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. The
 bilateral hila are unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes. There is no
 focal consolidation.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Multiple dilated bowel loops are seen at
 the lower aspect of the film, partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube in grossly appropriate location with side-port distal to the
 GE junction.
 2. Clear lungs without focal consolidation.
 3. Dilated small bowel loops, better evaluated on earlier same-day CT abdomen
 and pelvis.
