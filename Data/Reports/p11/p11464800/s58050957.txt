                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  A large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated,
 though there is likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly
 demonstrated.  Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Large hiatal hernia.
