                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with new valvular disease and effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A single-lead pacemaker device is noted
 with lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Interval removal of IJ, ET
 tube, and nasogastric tube.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are noted
 with adjacent atelectasis which appear to be increased compared to the prior
 examination, however this may reflect the first true upright study that the
 patient has had.  Cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed in the presence of
 bilateral pleural effusions and should be followed with echo. There has been
 interval removal of the pericardial drain. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are noted with adjacent
 atelectasis which appear to be increased compared to the prior examination,
 however this may reflect first true upright study.
