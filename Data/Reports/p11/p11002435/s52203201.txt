 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:42 PM
  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema continues to decrease.  Heterogeneous right
  mid to lower lung opacities remain, however, possibly due to an infectious
  process, which if present would be new compared to the first of two chest
  radiographs from ___.  Alternatively, these opacities could be
  residual areas of asymmetric edema, although their lobulated morphology would
  be unusual.  A moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed.  A
  tiny right pleural effusion is decreased.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
  ___ by Dr. ___ at 19:40 via telephone on the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pacemaker placement for heart block, micro
 perforation of RV causing tamponade, pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema including right basal reexpansion edema is continuing to
 improve.  Residual focal opacities in the right lower lung is concerning for
 pneumonia.  Left severe pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Left-sided pacemaker has one lead in the right ventricle.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema including right sided reexpansion edema is continuing
 to improve.
 2.  Residual focal consolidation in right lower lung is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  
 
 This was discussed with the referring physician by resident, Dr. ___.
