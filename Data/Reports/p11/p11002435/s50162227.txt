                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left pleural effusion occupies almost the entirety of the
 left hemithorax and has apparently slightly increased in size since the recent
 radiograph.  Only a small amount of aerated lung is present in the left
 suprahilar region, with remainder of the left lung atelectatic, presumably on
 the basis of the effusion.  On the right, a moderate pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Widening and straightening of left mediastinal contour is
 unchanged since the recent radiograph, and may reflect medially loculated
 pleural fluid.  On the right, a moderate pleural effusion and adjacent basilar
 atelectasis are unchanged.  Interval placement of right PICC, with tip
 terminating in the expected location of the proximal right atrium.  Indwelling
 single lead permanent pacemaker is unchanged.
