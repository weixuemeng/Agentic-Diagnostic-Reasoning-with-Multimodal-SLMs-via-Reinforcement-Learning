                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  VP shunt is again seen
 overlying the right hemithorax.  Left-sided pacemaker with wire is unchanged
 in position.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is
 indistinctness of a posterior lower rib on the right which appears new from
 prior study, may represent overlapping mildly displaced fracture, less likely
 a lytic lesion of the bone.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Indistinctness of a posterior
 lower rib may represent a mildly displaced overlapping fracture or less likely
 a lytic lesion of the bone.  If this is the patient's area of pain, recommend
 chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 803am on
