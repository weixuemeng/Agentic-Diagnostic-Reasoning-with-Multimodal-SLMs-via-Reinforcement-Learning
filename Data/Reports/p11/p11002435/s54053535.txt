                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Re-evaluate pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the proximal
 right atrium, which should be retracted 3 cm to place in the low SVC.  A left
 pectoral pacemaker with a single lead terminating in the right ventricle is
 again seen.  A right ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen coursing across the
 right neck and right hemi thorax into the abdomen.  A large left pleural
 effusion is slightly decreased in size from ___ with associated
 underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  A moderate right pleural effusion is
 unchanged with associated atelectasis of the right lung base.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There pleuro parenchymal scarring in the bilateral lung apices
 appears relatively symmetrical. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC with tip in proximal right atrium should be retracted 3 cm to
 place in the low SVC. 
 
 2.  Decreased size of large left pleural effusion from ___.  
 
 3.  Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
