                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation and electrophysiologic procedure complicated
 by right ventricular microperforation, pericardial effusion and tamponade
 status post pericardial drain placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left pectoral pacer and pericardial drain are unchanged in position. 
 Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with tip projecting 5.5 cm
 cranial to the carina.  NG tube is within the stomach although the tip is
 excluded on imaging.  Although objectively the heart size is normal, there has
 been mild interval increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette with mildly
 increased prominence of the mediastinal veins.  The moderate to large right
 pleural effusion is unchanged and the large left effusion is improved. 
 Pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interval increase in the cardiac silhouette with mildly dilated
 mediastinal veins warrant clinical evaluation of effective pericardial
 drainage.  Right pleural effusion is unchanged and left effusion is improved. 
 Left pacer, endotracheal tube, pericardial drain and NG tube are appropriately
 placed.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
 ___ at 20:05 on ___ at time of initial review.
