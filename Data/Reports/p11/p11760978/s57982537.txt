                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Ill-defined focal opacities within
 the right upper lobe are concerning for pneumonia. Streaky left lower lobe
 opacity is also likely present, and could reflect an addition area of
 infection. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles may suggest trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacities within the right upper lobe and streak left lower lobe opacity
 are concerning for pneumonia. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of
 this finding.
