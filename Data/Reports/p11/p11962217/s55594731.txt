                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsiveness, weakness.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT T-spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated similar to prior.  There are no focal opacities.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  On the
 lateral view the left posterior costophrenic sulcus is blunted, possibly a
 small pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  The mitral anulus is
 chronically heavily calcified.  There is no large pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild blunting of the posterior left costophrenic sulcus may represent small
 pleural effusion or pleural thickening. No acute intrathoracic process
 otherwise noted.
