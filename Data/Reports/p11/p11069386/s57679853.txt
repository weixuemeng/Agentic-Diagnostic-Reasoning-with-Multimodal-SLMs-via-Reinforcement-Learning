                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, to assess for aspiration or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence
 of the pulmonary vessels.  This is consistent with developing vascular
 congestion on a substrate of chronic pulmonary disease.  Given the extensive
 parenchymal changes, it is difficult to definitely exclude supervening
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
