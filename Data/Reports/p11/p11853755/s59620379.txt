                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F multiple falls. +head strike. pain lower ribs bil. 
 // injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 15:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices on 1 of the frontal images
 is mild blunting the lateral costophrenic angle suggesting small pleural
 effusions.  Prominence of the pulmonary arteries is consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension.  There is also mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Chain suture
 material is again noted over the medial right upper lung.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.  Evidence of pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 No obvious displaced rib fracture, however, this study is not sensitive for
 the detection of rib fracture.  If high clinical concern for rib fracture,
 dedicated rib series or CT is more sensitive.
