 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate right pleural effusion remains after thoracentesis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Retrocardiac opacity is associated with mild tenting
 of the left hemidiaphragm is suggestive of volume loss.  No additional
 consolidation is identified.  Moderate cardiomegaly is identified.

 Retrocardiac opacity associated with tenting of the left hemidiaphragm
 suggests volume loss such as in a focal atelectasis.  Consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
