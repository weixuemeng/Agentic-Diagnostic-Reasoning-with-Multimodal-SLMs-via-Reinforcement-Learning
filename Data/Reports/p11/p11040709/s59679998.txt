 As compared to the previous study from earlier the same date, a small left
 apical pneumothorax is in retrospect unchanged. Left chest tube is been
 removed in the interval. Moderate left and small right partially layering
 pleural effusions are difficult to compare to the prior study due to slight
 positional differences. Persistent adjacent bibasilar atelectasis, more severe
 on the left than the right.
