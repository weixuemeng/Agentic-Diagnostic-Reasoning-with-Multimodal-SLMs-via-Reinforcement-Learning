  Interval removal of pleural pigtail catheter and placement of a large-bore
  chest tube on the left. Significantly decreased size of moderate left
  pneumothorax. Small residual pneumothorax cannot be excluded, given that the
  patient is unlikely in full upright position. No mediastinal shift. Decreased
  pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumo thorax s/p CT insertion  // CT
 placement, pneumo interval change?      CT placement, pneumo interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pigtail catheter is
 been removed and replaced by a large bore chest tube on the left.  There is
 been almost complete re-expansion of the left lung. Otherwise, little overall
 change except for a more prominent subcutaneous gas along the left chest wall
 extending into the neck.
