                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia despite FiO2 100%, assess for reasons of hypoxia
 while intubated, rule out fluid overloaded.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph in semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day at 01:37.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval progression of perihilar opacities in the upper lung zones
 which likely reflects worsening neurogenic edema versus severe aspiration. The
 cardiac silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Endotracheal tube remains in appropriate position terminating 3.2 cm from the
 carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of neurogenic edema and/or severe aspiration.
