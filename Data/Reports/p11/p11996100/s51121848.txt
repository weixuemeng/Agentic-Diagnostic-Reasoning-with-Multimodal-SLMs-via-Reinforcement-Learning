                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, unresponsive  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the anterior right first rib may relate to
 overlapping structures, but suggest further evaluation with apical lordotic
 view.  No focal consolidation seen elsewhere.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the anterior right first rib may relate to
 overlapping bony structures however, underlying pulmonary opacity not
 excluded.  Recommend apical lordotic view for further evaluation.
 
 No evidence of focal consolidation seen elsewhere.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Apical lordotic view.
