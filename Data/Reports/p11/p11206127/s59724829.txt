  A right lower lobe opacity which could represent atelectasis though pneumonia
  is possible in the proper clinical setting.

  1. Hypoinflated lungs.
  2. Left lower lobe opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical
  correlation for superimposed infection is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, history of recent pneumonia.  Assess for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  Best seen on
 lateral view is increased opacity projecting over the posterior costophrenic
 angle which likely localizes to the right base on the frontal view.  Left
 basilar linear atelectasis is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right lower lobe opacity which could represent atelectasis though pneumonia
 is possible in the proper clinical setting.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation for superimposed infection is
 recommended.
