                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with MSSA pneumonia  // ___M with MSSA pneumonia; evaluate for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen multifocal airspace opacities are somewhat improved on the
 current study.  There is decreased opacity at bilateral lung bases, compatible
 with resolving pneumonia. There has been interval withdrawal of an enteric
 tube and a left-sided subclavian line. There is no pneumothorax. There is
 likely a small to moderate left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in multifocal airspace opacities.
