 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // eval progression of infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 09:04
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, improved on the left,
 worsened on the right. Findings suggest bilateral pneumonia perhaps due to
 aspiration. Heart is normal size. Pulmonary vasculature minimally engorged,
 but not sufficient to suggest pulmonary edema is the underlying problem.
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes
 into the stomach and out of view.
