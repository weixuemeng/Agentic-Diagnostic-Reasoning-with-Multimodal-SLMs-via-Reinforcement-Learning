                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded with calcifications noted
 diffusely.  The previous pattern of moderate pulmonary edema has improved
 slightly.  Ovoid hazy opacity within the right mid lung field likely reflects
 fluid within the minor fissure.  Small right pleural effusion is also
 unchanged.  The previously noted small left pleural effusion appears decreased
 in size.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, improved from the prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, with decreased size of the left pleural effusion and increased
 fluid within the right minor fissure.
