                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible aspiration event, bilateral crackles
 and low-grade fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacification at both lung bases has increased since ___
 consistent with aspiration, but the lateral view shows that the underlying
 abnormality in the lower lungs is severe reticulation, which could be
 bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis, either alone, or in combination. 
 Findings therefore suggest aspiration in the setting of chronic lung disease. 
 There is no pneumonia in the upper lungs and no evidence of congestive heart
 failure.  Heart size is normal.  Supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis
 catheter set ends in the SVC and upper right atrium.  No pneumothorax. 
 Pleural effusion is small if any, but the posterior sulci are excluded from
 the lateral view.  No pneumothorax.
