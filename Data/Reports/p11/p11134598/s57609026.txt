                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, now with
 clinical concern for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Retrosternal opacity and obscuration of the right paratracheal stripe may
 reflect an anterior mediastinal mass.  Diffuse sclerosis of the upper thoracic
 vertebrae is concerning for possible sclerotic metastases.  Normal hilar
 contours and pleural surfaces.  Fully expanded, clear lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely anterior mediastinal mass that warrants further evaluation with CT
 chest.
 Upper thoracic vertebral sclerosis raises concern for metastatic disease,
 especially given the history of prostate cancer, and also warrants further
 evaluation with CT chest.
 No acute pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Obtain CT chest for further evaluation of vertebral
 sclerosis and likely anterior mediastinal mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated to the ordering clinician through
 the radiologic critical results notification system at 17:36.
