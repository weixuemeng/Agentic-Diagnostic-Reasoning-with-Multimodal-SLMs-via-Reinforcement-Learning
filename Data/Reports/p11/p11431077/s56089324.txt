                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and without change.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is stable.  Lungs are clear.  Biapical
 thickening appears similar to prior study with symmetrical distribution. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Overall, lung volumes remain increased,
 suggesting the possibility of COPD.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and
 multilevel degenerative changes are present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
