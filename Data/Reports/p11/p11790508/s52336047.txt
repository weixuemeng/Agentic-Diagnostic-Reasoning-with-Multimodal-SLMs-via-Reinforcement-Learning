                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of question perforation,
 question free air under the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings, particularly at the lung bases.  Mild left base atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 costal and apical margins again appear slightly thickened, which may be due to
 fat deposition.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
