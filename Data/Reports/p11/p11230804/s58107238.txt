  1. Pleural fluid collection at the right lung base, possibly loculated.
  Lateral radiograph is recommended for further evaluation.
  
  2. Area of consolidation in the right lower lung above the pleural fluid
  collection, which could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia
  in the right clinical setting. Lateral radiograph is recommended for further
  evaluation.
  
  3. Increased retrocardiac fullness along the contour of the descending aorta,
  which could represent fluid in the mediastinum. A lateral radiograph is
  recommended for initial further evaluation, and pending the results the
  lateral, a CT may be indicated.
 WET READ VERSION #___ ___ ___ ___ 2:40 AM
  New homogeneous opacity right lung base, suggestive of a pleural fluid
  collection, possibly loculated. No focal consolidation seen, but cannot
  completely exclude a subtle opacity overlying the probable pleural fluid
  opacity. If further characterization of the opacity at right lung base is
  desired, PA and lateral radiographs were allow for better characterization.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with duodenal perforation s/p repair now febrile 
 // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs well expanded.  There is been interval development of a homogeneous
 opacity in the right lung base, most consistent with a pleural fluid
 collection. The morphology of this collection is suspicious for possible
 loculated effusion.  Above this fluid collection, there is an area of
 consolidation that could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia
 in the right clinical setting. There is increased retrocardiac fullness along
 the contour of the descending aorta, which could represent fluid in the
 mediastinum. A trace left pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There has been interval
 removal of the previously seen NG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Pleural fluid collection at the right lung base, possibly loculated.
 Lateral radiograph is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 2. Area of consolidation in the right lower lung above the pleural fluid
 collection, which could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia
 in the right clinical setting. Lateral radiograph is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 
 3. Increased retrocardiac fullness along the contour of the descending aorta,
 which could represent fluid in the mediastinum. A lateral radiograph is
 recommended for initial further evaluation, and pending the results the
 lateral, a CT may be indicated.
