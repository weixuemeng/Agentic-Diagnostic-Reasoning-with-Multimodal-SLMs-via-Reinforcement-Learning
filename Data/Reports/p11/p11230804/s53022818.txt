                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is status post left chest tube placement with decreased size of the
 left pneumothorax. A small right apical pneumothorax is also likely present.
 There are persistent bilateral areas of plate-like atelectasis.  Extensive
 pneumomediastinum with extension of the air into the superficial and deep soft
 tissues of the neck and retroperitoneal gas is unchanged.  There is no large
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post left chest tube placement with decreased left pneumothorax.
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax.
 3.  Persistent bilateral plate-like atelectasis.
 4.  Large retroperitoneal free air (as seen on prior CT abdomen), with
 superior extension into the mediastinum and the soft tissues of the neck.
