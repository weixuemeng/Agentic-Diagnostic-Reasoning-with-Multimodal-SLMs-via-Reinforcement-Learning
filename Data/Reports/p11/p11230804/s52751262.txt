                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumothorax seen on CT abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  A
 moderate-sized pneumothorax is present on the left.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax on the right.  There is extensive pneumomediastinum tracking into
 the soft tissues of the neck.  As seen on the previous CT abdomen from the
 same day, the free air apparently originates from the retroperitoneum. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate  left pneumothorax.
 2.  Large pneumomediastinum extending into the soft tissues of the neck with
 gas projecting over the abdomen representing  retroperitoneal source of the
 free air.
 3.  Bilateral platelike atelectasis.
