 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a new focal airspace opacity in the right
 lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.

 New right lower lobe opacity could represent early pneumonia.  A repeat
 radiograph is recommended after adequate treatment to ensure resolution.
