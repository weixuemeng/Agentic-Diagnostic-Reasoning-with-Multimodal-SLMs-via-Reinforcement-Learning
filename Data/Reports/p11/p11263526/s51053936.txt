                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aphasia. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced
 on the left, likely reflect atelectasis.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification of the
 thoracic aorta again noted.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
