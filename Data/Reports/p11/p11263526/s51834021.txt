                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis, with no evidence of large pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or focal consolidation. Focal rounded 4 mm
 calcific density projecting over the right mid lung may represent a granuloma.
 The heart is top normal in size, otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable.  There is pronounced kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine
 with possible loss of vertebral body height at multiple levels, although the
 spine is not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Possible loss of vertebral body height at multiple thoracic levels,
 although the spine is not well evaluated on this study.
