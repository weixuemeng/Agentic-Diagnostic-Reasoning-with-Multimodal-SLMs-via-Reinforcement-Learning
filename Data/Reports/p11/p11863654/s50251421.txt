                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Aortic knob atherosclerotic
 calcifications are again demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky and patchy
 opacities are again noted bilaterally, most pronounced within the mid lung
 fields and lung bases, not substantially changed from the previous radiograph,
 and likely chronic. No new areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may indicate chronic pleural
 thickening or trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and streaky opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the mid lung
 fields and lung bases, findings which appear chronic. No new areas of focal
 consolidation demonstrated. Small bilateral pleural effusions versus pleural
 thickening.
