 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  There
 is again noted to be a right arm PICC line with its tip in the high SVC. 
 There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with linear density in the left mid
 and lower lung most compatible with atelectasis.  There is no overt evidence
 for pulmonary edema or convincing signs of pneumonia.  The patient is rotated
 which somewhat limits evaluation of the mediastinum.  The heart size appears
 grossly preserved.  No acute bony abnormalities are seen.

 atelectasis.  No convincing signs of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
