                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rule out pneumonia.  Fevers and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  This exam is
 technically limited due to a poor exposure.  A right PICC terminates in the
 upper SVC.  Mild interstitial edema has improved.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically suboptimal exam but no definite pneumonia.  Right
 PICC in the upper SVC, just past the confluence.
