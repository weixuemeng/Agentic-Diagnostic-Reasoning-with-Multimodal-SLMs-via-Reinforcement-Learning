                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds at left base.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm with a dense streak of opacification above it.  This could
 represent atelectasis or fibrosis.  The appearance does not have the
 characteristics of acute pneumonia.
 
 Remainder of the examination is within normal limits, and there is no vascular
 congestion.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged.
