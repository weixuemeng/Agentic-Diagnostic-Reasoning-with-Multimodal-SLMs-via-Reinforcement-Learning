                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates
 4.2 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube is visualized with
 the tip in the stomach.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions.  Consolidation in the lung bases,
 left greater than right, may be secondary to atelectasis, though aspiration or
 pneumonia are also within the differential.  The remainder of the lungs appear
 clear.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Standard position of lines and tubes.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, possible atelectasis,
 though aspiration or pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical circumstances.
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.
