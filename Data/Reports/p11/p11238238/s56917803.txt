                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, at 11:47 and allowing for differences in positioning,
 I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is extensive opacity in the left mid and lower zones, likely
 reflecting combination of pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is also patchy right cardiophrenic opacity, which is
 unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, though this is likely
 accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  (Please see report of intervening
 chest CT, which describes complete collapse of the left lower lobe and medial
 segment of the right lower lobe and ground-glass opacities concerning for
 infection in the aerated upper lobes.)
