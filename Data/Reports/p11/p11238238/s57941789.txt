                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  O2 sat mid 80s.  Question aspiration pneumonia.  Mucous plug.
 
 CHEST, 1 AP PORTABLE VW
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, there is increased
 density at the left base, suspicious for worsening left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. 
 
 The cardiac silhouette, pulmonary hila, and interstitial markings are all
 prominent -- while these findings could relate to cardiopulmonary failure,
 they are likely also accentuated by low lung volumes. No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the left base opacity is greater. The 
 inspiratory volumes are lower and, associated with this, and the vascular
 markings and hila are more prominent.
