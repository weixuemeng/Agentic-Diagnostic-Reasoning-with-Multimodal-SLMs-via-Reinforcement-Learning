                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Hazy opacification of the left hemithorax is consistent with large
 pleural effusion seen on CT.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
 the consolidation previously noted, and there is similar increased
 opacification (though much less) at the right base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little overall change.
