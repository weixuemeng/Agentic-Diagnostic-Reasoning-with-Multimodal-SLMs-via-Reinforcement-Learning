                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, now with
 respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___
 and CTA chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 6.6 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus,  its tip
 out of field of view.  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip projects
 over cavoatrial junction.  Diffuse bilateral rounded lucencies predominantly
 at the lung bases signify emphysema, better assessed on CT exam of ___. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Perihilar vascular
 congestion is noted.  Upper lobe heterogeneous opacities, left greater than
 right, are unchanged, which may represent infection or asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Retrocardia opacity is new since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous opacities in the upper lungs, left greater than right, not
 significantly changed since ___ exam.  Retrocardiac opacity is new since
 prior.  Above findings may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or multifocal
 infection
 
 2.  Moderate emphysema with basal predominance, compatible with patient's
 given history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
