                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dyspnea, history of
 COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Left-sided subclavian
 central venous catheter is again seen terminating at the distal SVC/cavoatrial
 junction.  The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms. 
 As compared to the prior study, there is increased opacification in the right
 lung base which could be due to infection/or aspiration.  No focal
 consolidation is seen in the left.  There is slight increased blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle which could be due to pleural thickening, although
 trace pleural effusion may be present.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Increased right lung base opacity concerning for pneumonia which could be
 due to infection and/or aspiration, with possible trace right pleural
 effusion.  Recommend followup to resolution in this patient with emphysema.
