                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction, as before. 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Irregular pulmonary architecture again suggests emphysema.  Patchy
 opacities in the right mid to lower lung appear unchanged and are streaky in
 character, most suggestive of chronic atelectasis or scarring without
 significant change.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting emphysema without definite evidence for acute
 disease.
