                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alpha-1 antitrypsin, acute hypoxic event, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 2:22 a.m., multiple lines and tubes have been
 removed.  A left subclavian indwelling catheter tip is unchanged, overlying
 the SVC/RA junction.  Otherwise, no significant change is detected.  Again
 seen is hyperinflation and parenchymal scarring.  Relative lucency at both
 apices is stable and may reflect bullous change.
