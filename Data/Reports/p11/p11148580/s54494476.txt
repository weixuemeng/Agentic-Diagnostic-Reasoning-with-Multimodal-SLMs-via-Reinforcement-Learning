                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with new CHF.  Assess for fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate central venous catheter tip
 projecting over cavoatrial junction.  Low lung volumes.  Areas of scarring and
 lucency in the right lung base are noted.  Emphysematous changes at the bases
 are stable.  Perihilar vascular congestion is noted.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Compression
 deformities of the thoracic spine are stable.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are new. Right lung base confluent opacity has progressed in
 comparison to prior exams. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions with perihilar vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Bibasilar emphysematous changes, compatible with patient's given history
 of alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
 
 3.  Right lung base confluent opacity has progressed in comparison to prior
 exams and may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting.
