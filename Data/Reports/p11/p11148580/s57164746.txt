                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and possible
 pneumonia seen on ___ exam.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CTA chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate left central venous catheter
 with subclavian approach projecting over distal SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Lungs appear hyperinflated.  Diffuse emphysema is noted
 extending into lower lobes.   Heterogeneous opacity in the right lung base has
 resolved.  Linear opacity in the right lung base persists.  Small right-sided
 pleural effusion is no longer visualized.  There is no left pleural effusion. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous right lung base opacity has largely resolved. Linear opacity
 in the right lung base may represent residual pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 2.  Diffuse emphysema extending into lung bases, compatible with the patient's
 reported history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
