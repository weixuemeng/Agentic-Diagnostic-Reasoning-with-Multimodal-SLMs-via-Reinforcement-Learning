                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency with COPD, altered mental status,
 hyperglycemia and upper respiratory tract infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left side Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  Lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and lucency of the
 lungs which is most pronounced in the bases compatible with alpha 1
 antitrypsin deficiency.  Scarring within the lung bases is unchanged. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly bilaterally likely reflect
 chronic pleural thickening.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild compression deformities in the thoracic spine
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
