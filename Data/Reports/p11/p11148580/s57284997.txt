                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with respiratory distress status post ET tube
 positioning.  Question location.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube ending 5.6
 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube traverses inferiorly out of view with
 side port below the GE junction.  A left subclavian approach Port-A-Cath has
 tip terminating in the lower SVC.  The heart is prominent.  The lungs are
 mildly hyperinflated, consistent with known emphysema.  There is increased
 hazy opacities in the left upper lung, which likely represents asymmetric
 edema, versus consolidation.  There is also right upper upper lung opacity,
 raising question of consolidation.  There is also subsegmental volume loss in
 the lower lung zones.  Previously seen right lower lobe consolidation has
 improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate ET tube positioning.
 2.  Prominent cardiac contour and increased left greater than right upper lung
 opacification, likely representing cardiac decompensation and asymmetric
 edema.  
 3.  Can't exclude supervening infection in the upper lungs.  Consider
 reevaluation following treatment for pulmonary edema.  Improving right lower
 lobe consolidation.
 4.  Severe emphysema, basal predominant, in keeping with known Alpha-1
 antitrypsin deficiency.
