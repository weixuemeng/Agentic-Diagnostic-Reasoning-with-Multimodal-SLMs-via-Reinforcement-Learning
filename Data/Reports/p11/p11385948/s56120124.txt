                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OF ___
 
 Compared to previous radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and the aorta is tortuous
 and calcified, both unchanged.  Asymmetrical right apical thickening appears
 similar since ___, and multifocal areas of apparent parenchymal
 scarring in the right middle lobe and lingula with associated bronchiectasis,
 likely reflecting scarring or atypical mycobacterial infection.  A new
 confluent area of opacity has developed in the right upper lobe posteriorly,
 best visualized on the lateral radiograph superior and posterior to the aortic
 arch.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  No pleural effusion.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized, and note is made of mild scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New posterior right upper lobe consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
 suggested to document resolution and to exclude malignancy mimicking a lung
 infection.
 
 2.  Otherwise, stable radiographic appearance of the chest with chronic
 abnormalities in right middle lobe and lingula, which may be due to scarring
 or chronic atypical mycobacterial infection.
