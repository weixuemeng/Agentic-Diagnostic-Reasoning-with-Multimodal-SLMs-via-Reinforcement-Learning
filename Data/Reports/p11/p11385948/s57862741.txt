 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath, rule out lung masses.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 bigger inspiratory effort, the lungs are well ventilated.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Moderate
 scoliosis causes mild asymmetry of the rib cage.  In unchanged manner, there
 is bilateral apical thickening, with a substantially stronger thickening at
 the right lung apex, which causes decreased radiodensity in this area. 
 However, there is no circumscribed nodule or mass.  No pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of acute lung changes such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
