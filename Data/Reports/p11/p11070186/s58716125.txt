                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute abdomen  // UPRIGHT, please evaluate for
 free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Portable AP view of the chest, with lordotic positioning.  The
 image is not labeled as as an upright film, of uncertain significance.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 EKG leads overlie the upper chest.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected on this lordotic view.  Mild increased retrocardiac
 density could reflect some left lower lobe atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis
 noted in the right cardiophrenic region.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  On the current view, small amount a
 gas is seen in the expected site of the gastric fundus.  Otherwise, there is a
 relative paucity of abdominal gas.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible left lower lobe atelectasis.  Minimal right cardiophrenic angle
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, doubt acute pulmonary process.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm, though is difficult to confirm that
 this view was obtained standing.  Relative paucity of gas seen in the
 visualized upper portion of the abdomen.
