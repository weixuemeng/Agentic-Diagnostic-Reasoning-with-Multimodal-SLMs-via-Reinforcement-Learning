                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, fever  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Best seen on the lateral view is an increase in opacities overlying the
 anterior heart. This may correspond to areas of bronchial thickening seen in
 the right medial hemithorax on the frontal radiograph. No pleural effusion.
 Normal cardiac size and hilar contours.  No pneumothorax. A calcified nodule
 in the right mid lung is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity projecting in the right middle lobe, not definitive for
 pneumonia and perhaps related to bronchitis. However, if symptoms persists, a
 repeat exam in 24 hr would be reasonable to exclude blossoming pneumonia.
 
 Findings discussed with ___ at 7:53 am via telephone by ___
 ___.
