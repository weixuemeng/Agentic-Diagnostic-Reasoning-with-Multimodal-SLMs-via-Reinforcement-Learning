 Please eval for edema, interval change in effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 remain in place.  There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bilateral pleural effusions persist,
 more prominent on the left, with compressive basilar atelectasis. More focal
 area of opacification remains in the right perihilar and suprahilar region.
 Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
