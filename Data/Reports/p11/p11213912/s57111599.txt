                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___ year old man with recent anterior STEMI c/b cardiogenic shock now admitted
 with worsening respiratory failure, evaluate for pulmonary edema and evidence
 of consolidation     .
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs dating back to
 ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the right pulmonary artery, and can be pulled
 back approximately 4 cm. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 Transvenous pacing veins ending in the right atrium and right ventricle. A
 nasoenteric to the crosses the left hemidiaphragm with its tip not visualized.
 Since prior, the appearance of the lungs is not significantly changed with
 diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, most pronounced at the right upper lung
 zone. The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged with persistent retrocardiac
 atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. There are bilateral layering pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the right pulmonary artery and can be pulled
 back approximately 4 cm.
 2. Persistent diffuse bilateral airspace opacities most pronounced in the
 right upper lobe, compatible with pulmonary edema although a multifocal
 infection would have to be considered in the correct clinical setting.
