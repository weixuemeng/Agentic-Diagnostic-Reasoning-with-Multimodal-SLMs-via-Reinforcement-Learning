                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Coronary disease status post myocardial infarction and
 atrioventricular block with dual-chamber pacemaker placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual lead pacemaker/ ICD device that is in changed with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent suspected
 pleural effusion on the left, probably at least small to moderate in size in
 addition to mild diffuse opacification suggestive of pulmonary edema. This
 appearance is somewhat heterogeneous, however including the possibility of
 developing focal opacity in the right upper lobe, in addition to persistent
 focal lower lobe opacities. Possible nodule appears less distinct on this
 study; the image is less sharp. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Worsening multifocal opacification, notably with suspicion for developing
 new right upper lobe opacity. This appearance raises concern for multifocal
 pneumonia versus a heterogeneous presentation of pulmonary edema, and
 regardless there is probably an element of fluid overload.
 
 2.  No definite persistent visualization of a nodule which appears more vague
 on this study in the left upper lobe. However, continued radiographic followup
 is recommended and if the finding were not to resolve entirely chest CT should
 then be considered.
