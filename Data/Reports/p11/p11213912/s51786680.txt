 A portable upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right chest wall pacer lead projects over the left ventricle. Again seen, is
 moderate bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities most pronounced at the
 lung bases. A right upper lobe opacity is also present and likely represents a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. There is no pneumothorax. There
 are bibasilar pleural effusions. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 Dense retrocardiac atelectasis is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, may be mildly improved compared to prior, although
 direct comparison is difficult due to differences in position.
