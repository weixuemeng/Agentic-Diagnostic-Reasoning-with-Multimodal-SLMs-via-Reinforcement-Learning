                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with STEMI and IABP  // IABP position
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart does not appear enlarged. The aorta is unfolded, contributing to
 prominence of the mediastinal silhouette. The hila are also slightly
 prominent, with a tapered appearance. An IABP is present -- the  tip overlies
 the expected location of the descending aorta. However, the radiopaque tip
 probably lies approximately 2.5 cm below the inferior edge of the aortic arch
 itself. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No focal
 consolidation. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No gross effusion. No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 The IABP tip overlies the descending aorta, approximately 2.5 cm below the
 expected site of the inferior edge of the aortic arch. Clinical correlation
 regarding potential advancement is requested.
 
 Addendum:  At this time, a subsequent chest x-ray is available and shows that
 the balloon pump has been removed.
