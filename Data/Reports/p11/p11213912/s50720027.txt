 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube remains about 5 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube again extends into
 the stomach, though the side-hole is at or above the level of the
 esophagogastric junction. There again are diffuse bilateral airspace
 consolidations, which according to the clinical history is consistent with
 pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered. Hazy opacification at the bases is consistent
 with layering effusions. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
