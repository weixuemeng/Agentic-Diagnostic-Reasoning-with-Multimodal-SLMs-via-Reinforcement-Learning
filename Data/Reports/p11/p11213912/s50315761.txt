                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male with recent prolonged hospitalization at ___
 (___ thru ___) after an anterior STEMI. Presents from
 rehabilitation center with hypotension and hypoxia likely in setting of CHF
 exacerbation. Evaluate for pneumonia, edema, or interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors with direct comparison made to study from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central venous and the Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed.
 Remaining support and monitoring devices are in unchanged positions.
 
 There appears to be some slight interval improvement in the bilateral pleural
 effusions, although this may be due to upright patient positioning. Focal
 opacity in the right mid lung is more prominent and compatible with known
 pneumonia seen on recent chest CT. There is bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions, although this could
 also be due to upright patient positioning.
 
 2.  Focal opacity in the right mid lung compatible with known pneumonia seen
 on recent CT chest.
 
 3.  Persistent mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
