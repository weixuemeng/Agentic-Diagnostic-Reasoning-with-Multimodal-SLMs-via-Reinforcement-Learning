                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is limited by patient rotation and low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette
 size remains moderately enlarged.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted at the aortic knob.  Mediastinal contours appear grossly unchanged. 
 There is new mild to moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness.  Retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectasis
 combined with a small left pleural effusion, though pneumonia is not excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.  Patchy opacity within the right lung base
 may also reflect an additional area of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient rotation.  Interval
 development of mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar patchy atelectasis
 with possible small left pleural effusion, though infection is not excluded.
