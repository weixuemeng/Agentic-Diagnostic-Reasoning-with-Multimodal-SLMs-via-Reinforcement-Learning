                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple comorbidities, recently treated for
 pneumonia, presenting with  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes persists.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 again noted.  The aorta is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Linear and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Please note that assessment of the extreme
 lung apices is obscured due to the patient's neck and soft tissues of this
 region obscuring this area.  Degenerative changes are noted in the
 glenohumeral joints.  Irregularity of the left scapula was not clearly noted
 on the prior study, and clinical correlation with any tenderness in this
 region is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
 2. Irregularity of the left scapula, not apparent on the prior study. 
 Clinical correlation with any tenderness in this region is recommended, and
 consider dedicated left shoulder radiographs for further assessment.
