                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Assessment of the left apex is obscured by the
 patient's neck projecting over this area.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with a left ventricular predominance is again noted.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are present.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated.
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous
 gastrostomy catheter is seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study with low lung volumes.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
