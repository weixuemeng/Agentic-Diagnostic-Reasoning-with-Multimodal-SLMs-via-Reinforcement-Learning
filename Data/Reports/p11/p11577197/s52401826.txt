                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dysphagia and hx of brain stem stroke with
 aspiration  // Please evaluate for dobhoff tube placement - 2 step
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed feeding tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes are low,
 contributing to vascular crowding.  However, persistent peribronchial cuffing
 suggests mild pulmonary edema, unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are
 magnified by the projection. The patient's chin obscures the left lung apex,
 precluding evaluation for pneumothorax on this side. There is no right
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New Dobbhoff tube terminates in the stomach. No other significant interval
 change.
