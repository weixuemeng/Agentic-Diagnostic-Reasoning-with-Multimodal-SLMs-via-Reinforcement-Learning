 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna, CHF  // eval for pna vs pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 18:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Shallow inspiration accentuates heart size, pulmonary vascularity.  Pulmonary
 vascularity has improved.  Improved bilateral perihilar opacities, improving
 pneumonitis versus improving edema.  Improved right basilar atelectasis. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis versus infiltrate.  Small right
