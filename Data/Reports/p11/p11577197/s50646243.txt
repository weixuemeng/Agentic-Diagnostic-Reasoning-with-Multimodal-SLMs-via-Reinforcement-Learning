                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is somewhat limited by patient positioning, low lung
 volumes, and the patient's chin and neck obscuring the left apex.  The cardiac
 silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 grossly unchanged.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is due to low lung
 volumes without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis, however infection is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is identified.  A
 percutaneous gastrostomy catheter projects over the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis
 however infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
