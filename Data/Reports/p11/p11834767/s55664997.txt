                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough and multiple
 myeloma.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is new minimal opacity at the
 left lung base that most likely reflects atelectasis and unlikely to represent
 new infectious process.
 
 The aorta is tortuous which potentially reflects the presence of scoliosis. 
 The lateral view demonstrates multiple compression fractures, consistent with
 known history of myeloma.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
