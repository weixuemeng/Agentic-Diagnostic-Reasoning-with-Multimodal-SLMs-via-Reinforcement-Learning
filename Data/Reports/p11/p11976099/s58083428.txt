                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  cough, shortness of breath // ?  Pneumonia vs
 fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is not substantially changed in the interval. The
 mediastinal contour appears similar with atherosclerotic calcification noted
 in the aortic knob.  Mild pulmonary edema is not substantially changed
 compared to the previous examination.  Linear opacities in the right mid lung
 field and right lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated with patchy opacities in both
 lung bases, potentially atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are
 mild to moderate degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.
