                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Again, there is evidence of pectus excavatum deformity
 accounting for subtle opacity at the right heart border, less conspicuous as
 compared to the prior study.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No displaced
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Please note that CT is more
 sensitive in detecting rib and spine fractures.
