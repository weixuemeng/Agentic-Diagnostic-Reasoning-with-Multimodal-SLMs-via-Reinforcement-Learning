                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with decreased breath sounds on the left,
 question pneumonia, question pneumothorax, question pleural effusions.  
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted and compared to
 a prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval appearance of increasing bibasilar airspace opacities which
 likely represent worsening pneumonia or aspiration, although given underlying
 emphysema, pulmonary edema should also be considered.  The upper lungs appear
 grossly clear.  Streaky linear opacity in the right mid lung likely reflects
 scarring.  There is likely a small left effusion.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy with valve replacement.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess due to the predominantly left lower lobe
 airspace process.  No pneumothorax.  There is a thoracolumbar curvature with
 calcification of the descending aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
