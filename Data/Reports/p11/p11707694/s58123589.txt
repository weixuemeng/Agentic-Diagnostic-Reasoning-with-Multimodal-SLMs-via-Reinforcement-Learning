                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with sepsis, multiple laparotomies and
 prolonged intubation.
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are probably
 unchanged allowing difference in positioning of the patient.
 Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are stable. Lines and tubes are in
 standard position.
