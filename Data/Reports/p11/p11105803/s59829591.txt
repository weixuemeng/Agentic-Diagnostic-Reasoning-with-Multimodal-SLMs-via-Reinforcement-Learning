                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ERCP, severe sepsis, now short of breath, chest pain.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 3:44 a.m.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Low inspiratory volumes.  
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and slightly
 unfolded.  The right hilum is prominent, though compatible with the appearance
 on ___.  
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is blunting of both costophrenic angles,
 which is slightly more pronounced, and there is new opacity at the left lower
 lobe, with partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Borderline upper
 zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly, similar to prior.
 2.  Small bilateral effusions, possibly slightly worse.
 3.  New opacity at the left base suggesting left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 4.  Prominent right hilum for which clinical correlation is requested.
