                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart size is difficult to assess. 
 Multifocal opacities in the lower lungs appear more confluent than on the
 prior study, particularly at the right lung base.  The significance is
 uncertain since there has been opacification in the area suggesting chronic
 scarring.  However, along the lateral right lung base, a new lateral component
 was not clearly present on recent prior radiographs and may represent
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy lateral right lower lung opacity for which the possibility
 of pneumonia superimposed upon existing atelectasis could be considered in the
 appropriate setting.
