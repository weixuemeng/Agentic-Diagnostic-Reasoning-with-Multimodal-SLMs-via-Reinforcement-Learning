  ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  A left upper extremity PICC
  terminates in the axilla.  Enteric tube is within the stomach.  Increasing
  opacities of the left lung base are likely atelectasis, though, developing
  infection/aspiration should be considered as well.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left PICC line tip lies within the axilla.  Other monitoring
 and support devices are essentially unchanged.  Basilar opacifications most
 likely represent atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
