                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.  Single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:58.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval significant worsening of bibasilar consolidations with now
 increased obscuration of the hemidiaphragms, particularly on the left. 
 Findings may be due to worsening atelectasis, underlying consolidation in the
 setting of right basilar pneumonia.  However, there may also have been
 interval aspiration.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the level of
 the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm,
 inferior aspect not included on the image.
