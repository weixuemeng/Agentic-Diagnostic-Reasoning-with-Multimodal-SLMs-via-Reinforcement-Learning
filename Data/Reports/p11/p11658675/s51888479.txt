 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent aspiration pneumonias, and recent
 increase in sputum and also more hypoxemia  // assess for pneumonic
 infiltrates or chf
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, likely caused by recurrent aspiration pneumonias, are minimally
 more extensive.  The true extent of the changes is better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph, where the additional fibrotic
 component of the changes is better appreciated.  No pleural effusions.  Mild
 cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
