                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia, now with fever and shortness
 of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low with persistent bibasilar opacities, not well evaluated
 on this single view; there is improved aeration at the left lung base compared
 to prior.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are stable; heart size is exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  Lower thoracic vertebroplasty again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities with interval improvement in aeration at the left
 lung base.
