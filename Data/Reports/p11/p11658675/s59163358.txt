                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in patient with chronic aspiration
 pneumonia, now admitted for recurrence.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiograph from ___ as well as
 multiple prior radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study performed nine hours earlier, there has
 been interval increase in density of the bibasilar opacities which likely
 represent aspiration pneumonia superimposed on chronic scarring and
 atelectasis at these locations.  The upper lung fields are clear.  There is no
 mediastinal widening.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Aspiration pneumonia superimposed on chronic bibasilar lung
 scarring and atelectasis.
