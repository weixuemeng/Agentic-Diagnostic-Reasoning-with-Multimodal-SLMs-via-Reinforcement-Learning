                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and hypoxic and chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable upright view of the chest.  Again seen are bibasilar
 opacities, some of which likely represent atelectasis and scarring given
 patient's history of chronic aspiration.  However, underlying pneumonia in
 lower lobes cannot be ruled out, particularly on the right where the opacity
 has progressed.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The upper lung zones appear clear.  No pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely represent combination of atelectasis
 and scarring given patient's history of chronic aspiration.  However,
 underlying pneumonia in the lower lobes particularly on the right cannot be
 ruled out.
