                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath
 for three days.  Rule out acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Portions of the left hemithorax are
 excluded from the field of view.  Low lung volumes are noted with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings.  The cardiac silhouette appears unchanged from ___.  Bibasilar opacities are again noted which may represent atelectasis
 and scarring given patient's history of chronic aspiration; however, acute
 infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
