                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:47 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, fevers and COPD.  Suspect pneumonia or
 influenza.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most
 recently ___ and chest CT scans on ___ and ___:
 
 Atelectasis in the superior subsegment of the lingula is chronic accounts for
 some of the peribronchial opacification in the left lower lung.  The remainder
 of the abnormality in the left lower lung is more pronounced today than it has
 been from previous times, but it is now symmetric with the right lower lobe
 which has substantially improved today compared to some prior chest
 radiographs.  Overall, there has been no change since ___, and the
 most striking is pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
 
 Overall, the radiographic record demonstrates recurrent bibasilar pneumonias,
 probably due to reflux and aspiration.  Currently, although I cannot exclude
 bacterial pneumonia, the findings are best explained by congestive heart
 failure, perhaps with concurrent influenza or even viral pneumonia.  There is
 no appreciable pleural effusion.  The heart is not particularly enlarged. 
 Pleural effusion, if present, it is not substantial.
 
 I discussed the findings with a physician on the care team to call me, 9:45
 a.m.
