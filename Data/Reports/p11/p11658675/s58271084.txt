 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  History of aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There are opacities in both lower lungs, more extensive on
 the left than right, suggesting pneumonia, although aspiration is also a
 possibility to consider in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities at the lung bases, greater on the left than right,
 suggesting pneumonia or potentially aspiration could be considered.
