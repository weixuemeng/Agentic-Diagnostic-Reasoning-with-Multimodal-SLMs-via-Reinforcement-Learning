 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia, aspiration, chronic
 eosinophilic lung disease.   
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the day before.  Right lower
 lobe opacities is consistent with improved component of atelectasis,
 superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded, the upper lungs are clear. 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Cardiac size is normal.
