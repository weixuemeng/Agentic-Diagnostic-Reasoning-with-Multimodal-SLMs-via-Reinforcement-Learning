                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasal consolidations appear worse compared with prior exam. 
 There is also a new focus of a band-like consolidation extending from the left
 heart margin superiorly into the left mid lung.  There is obscuration of the
 bilateral cardiac margins as well as the left hemidiaphragms.  There might be
 a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Aortic knob calcifications are present. Evidence of prior vertebroplasties is
 noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval worsening of bibasal consolidations, with
 new opacity extending across the left lower lung and associated small
 left-sided pleural effusion. Finding could reflect pneumonia superimposed on a
 chronic lung disease.
