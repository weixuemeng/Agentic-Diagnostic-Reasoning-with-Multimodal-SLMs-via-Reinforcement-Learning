                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest.  There is a left lower lung opacity,
 decreased from prior study, with mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 This may represent pneumonia.  The previously seen right basilar opacity has
 improved.  No definite pleural effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax.  Low
 lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Residual bibasilar airspace opacities, most likely represent
 improving aspiration pneumonia.
