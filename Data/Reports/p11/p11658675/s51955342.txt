                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia with respiratory distress.  Evaluate for etiology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view.  There
 is a left basilar consolidation, some of which is linear in nature. 
 Additionally, there is a linear right basilar consolidation.  There is mild
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An apparent nodule is present in the right
 upper lobe, though obscured by the overlying monitoring wire.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, concerning for bibasilar
 pneumonia.
 2.  Possible right upper lobe nodule, somewhat obscured by an overlying
 monitoring wire.  Attention should be pain on follow-up exams, and if the
 finding persists, a CT should be considered.
