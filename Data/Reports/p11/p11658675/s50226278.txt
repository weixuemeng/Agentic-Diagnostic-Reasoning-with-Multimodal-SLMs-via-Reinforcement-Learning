                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are relatively
 linear bibasilar opacities, left worse than right.  There may have been
 interval progression at the left lung base compared to prior.  Superiorly, the
 lungs remain clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Multilevel
 vertebroplasty changes are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis or
 scarring, noting that infection or aspiration is not completely excluded.
