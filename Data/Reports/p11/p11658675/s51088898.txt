                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent aspiration,
 pneumonia, COPD and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Bibasilar areas of atelectasis appear to be unchanged though potentially
 progressed on the left.  The patient is rotated, thus the comparison is more
 difficult.  Upper lungs are essentially clear.  Minimal interstitial pulmonary
 edema is unchanged.  The pulmonary nodule suspected on the prior radiograph
 cannot be clearly seen on the current examination.
