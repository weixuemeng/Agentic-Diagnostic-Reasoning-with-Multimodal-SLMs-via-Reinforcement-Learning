                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Difficulty swallowing, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with mild calcification of the aortic knob again noted.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy and linear opacities in the
 lung bases appear progressed in the interval.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Vertebroplasty changes are noted within the mid
 and lower thoracic spine.  Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities, likely reflective of atelectasis, but
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
