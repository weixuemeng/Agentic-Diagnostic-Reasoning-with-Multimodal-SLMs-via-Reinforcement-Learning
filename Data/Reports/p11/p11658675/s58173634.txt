                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left PIC line now ends in the right atrium, 9cm below the level
 of the carina.  Low lung volume accentuates the pulmonary vasculature and
 makes evaluation of the cardiac size difficult.  Bibasilar opacities are
 mildly increased from prior study and are likely atelectatic.  Plate-like
 atelectasis is noted in the left lower lung.  The lung apices are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium.  If positioning
 in the lower SVC is desired, the catheter should be retracted by 4 cm.
