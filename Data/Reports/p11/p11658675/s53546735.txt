                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, unresponsiveness, shortness of breath,
 intubated, check placement of ET tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low
 lung volumes.  Streaky right basilar airspace opacities are relatively
 unchanged compared to the prior examination and likely represent vascular
 crowding and atelectasis; however, an underlying consolidation cannot be
 entirely excluded. Prominent vascular markings in the upper lungs suggest mild
 pulmonary edema, unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 Calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Presumed NG tube courses
 along the midline passing the diaphragm, tip is not included on the image.
 There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged appearance of bibasilar streaky opacification likely due to low
 lung volumes and atelectasis; however, an underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
 2.  Proper positioning of the endotracheal tube.
