                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post fall, history of ESBL  pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted in the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Attenuation of pulmonary
 vascular markings towards the apices indicates underlying emphysema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Evidence of prior kyphoplasty
 is seen within the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities the lung bases most likely reflective
 of atelectasis.  Infection, however, is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
