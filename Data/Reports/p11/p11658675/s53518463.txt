                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube has been placed in the interval with tip approximately 6
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is within the distal esophagus, and
 needs to be advanced by approximately 15 cm to lie satisfactory within the
 stomach.  Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis are re-
 demonstrated.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is clearly seen.  .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Suboptimal positioning of the enteric tube within the distal esophagus, and
 should be advanced by at least 15 cm for satisfactory positioning.
