                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes with accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Patient's chin overlies the medial lungs apices.  Given the above, there is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary edema. 
 Left perihilar opacity most likely relates to pulmonary edema rather than
 focal consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
