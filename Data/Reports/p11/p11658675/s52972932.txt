                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, shortness of breath, and recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low with crowding of the vascular structures. 
 At the right base there is a linear opacity most consistent with linear
 atelectasis.  This is stable from the prior chest radiograph on ___.  There is opacification of the left base, which appears slightly more
 dense than on the prior radiograph.  It is likely due to chronic aspiration,
 although a new event or underlying infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion, although the left costophrenic angle is not well
 evaluated due to opacity, and a small pleural effusion may be present.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly worsening of the left basilar opacity may be secondary to chronic
 aspiration, although a new aspiration event or underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  A small pleural effusion on the left may be present.  Further
 evaluation with PA and lateral images would be helpful for further evaluation
 if/when patient able.
 2.  Stable right basilar atelectasis.
