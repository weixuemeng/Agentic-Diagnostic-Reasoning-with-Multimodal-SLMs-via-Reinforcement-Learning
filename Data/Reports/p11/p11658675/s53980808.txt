                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Chronic
 opacities in the lower lungs are again noted which could represent a component
 of scarring, though an acute infectious component cannot be excluded in the
 right clinical setting.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess though appears grossly stable.  Mediastinal contour is
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung opacities, as seen on multiple prior exams may
 represent a chronic inflammatory process, though an acute infectious component
 may be present in the right clinical setting.  Please correlate clinically.
