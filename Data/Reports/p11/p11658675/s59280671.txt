                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia, query pneumonitis.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 There is significant bibasal infiltrate, much of which is linear suggesting an
 atelectatic component.  While that in the left lower lung zone has improved
 somewhat compared to prior study, that on the right is unchanged, though not
 worsened.
 
 Poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.  Allowing for projection, the
 heart size is normal.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma is grossly clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Low lung volumes, with bibasal infiltrates.  There is probably a large
 atelectatic component as an additional finding of note.  Minor interval
 improvement over prior study.
