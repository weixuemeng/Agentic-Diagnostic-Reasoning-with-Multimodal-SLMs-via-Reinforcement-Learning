 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough/+ bc  // r/p pna

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 Given this, there bibasilar atelectasis. Hilar and perihilar opacities may be
 due to a mild pulmonary edema, again exaggerated by the low lung volumes. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
