                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic aspiration and hypoxia.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the bibasilar opacities have worsened,
 particularly on the left.  The apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  High-density material in the mid thoracic spine is from
 a prior vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities, which most likely represent
 atelectasis.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
