                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated with orogastric tube placed, distal aspect of feeding tube
 not well seen on the prior chest radiograph.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:27.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm into the left
 upper quadrant, the expected position of the stomach.  Lingular and bibasilar
 opacities persist most likely due to atelectasis, small underlying component
 of aspiration not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
