                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Concern for urosepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and presumably coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery, noting anterior mediastinal clips.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable, including mild to moderate cardiomegaly with
 a left ventricular configuration.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  In addition to streaky opacities that are stable and suggest
 background scarring in the right upper lobe, there is mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema of interstitial type.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
