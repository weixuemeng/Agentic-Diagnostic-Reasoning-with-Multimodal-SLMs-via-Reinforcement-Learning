 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and
 cardiovascular surgery.  Interval removal of various support and monitoring
 devices with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in
 place, and no visible pneumothorax.  Stable widening of cardiomediastinal
 contours accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema, slightly worse than on the prior study.  Improved aeration
 within the left lower lobe and apparent decrease in small left pleural
 effusion, but slight increase in right pleural effusion since prior exam.
