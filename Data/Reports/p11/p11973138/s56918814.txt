                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the PICC line now extends to
 the upper SVC, slightly more advanced than on the previous study.  Kinking of
 the line is seen on the lateral view.  The opacification at the left base
 persists, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Stable widening
 of the mediastinum and cardiac enlargement.  Displacement of the trachea to
 the right with narrowing is again secondary to a left thyroid nodule as seen
 on CT.
