                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___'s disease who presented with
 fever, lethargy, concern for aspiration vs. HCAP.  // assess for infiltrates,
 possible PNA     assess for infiltrates, possible PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.  On
 the frontal view, there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle with an
 unsharp hemidiaphragm, although this is not definitely seen on the lateral
 view. Nevertheless, there is a small amount of increased opacification
 overlying the lower thoracic spine, raising the possibility of consolidation
 at the left base posteriorly. An although this could merely represent
 atelectasis, the possibility of aspiration or infectious process as suggested
 in the clinical history would have to the seriously considered.
