                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new ICD via left side approach. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 upright position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made
 with the next preceding portable single view chest examination of ___.  The patient is now extubated.  Status post sternotomy and bypass
 surgery as before.  A new permanent pacer has been placed in left anterior
 axillary position seen to be connected to two intravascular electrodes
 terminating in right atrial appendage position and apical portion of the right
 ventricle correspondingly.  Apparently, the previously existing temporary
 pacer wire advanced from below has been removed.  In comparison with the
 previous examination, the at that time existing marked pulmonary congestive
 pattern with central pulmonary edema has markedly improved.  On the other
 hand, the patient has now developed bilateral pleural effusions, blunt the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.  The amount is considered to be
 moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of permanent pacer,no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestive pattern but development of some small amount bilateral
 pleural effusion.
