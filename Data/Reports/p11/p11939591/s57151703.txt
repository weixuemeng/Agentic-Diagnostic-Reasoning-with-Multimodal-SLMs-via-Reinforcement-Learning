                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with STEMI, arrest cardiac cath, now undergoing cooling
 protocol.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube is in the stomach. 
 Swan-Ganz coming from a femoral venous access ends in the proximal pulmonary
 artery.  Widespread right lung opacification which could be related to
 aspiration or asymmetric edema has improved.  However, left lower lobe
 consolidation with small adjacent pleural effusion is new, which could reflect
 atelectasis or new aspiration.
 
 Prior sternotomy was done for CABG.  Mild cardiac congestion is unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Intra-aortic balloon pump is in adequate position.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Improvement of widespread right lung opacification, which could be related
 to aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 3.  New left lower lobe atelectasis or aspiration.
