                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:22 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after MI.  Now following cardiopulmonary arrest,
 evaluate lines and tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs, ___:
 
 ET tube, intra-aortic balloon pump, ascending Swan-Ganz catheter, and a
 nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively.  Heart is
 top normal size.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Large region of opacification
 in the right mid chest could be asymmetric edema or if the patient received
 vigorous resuscitation pulmonary contusion, alternatively moderate right
 pleural effusion collected posteriorly in this supine patient.  Upright
 radiographs recommended when feasible.  I do not see pneumothorax or displaced
 rib fractures.
