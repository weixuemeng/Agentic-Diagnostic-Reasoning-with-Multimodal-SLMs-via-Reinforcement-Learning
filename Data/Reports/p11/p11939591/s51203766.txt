                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated, status post acute MI.  Evaluate for ET
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  An endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  There
 has been interval removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump.  Remaining
 monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.  Asymmetrically
 distributed right-side predominant airspace opacities have slightly worsened
 since examination from ___.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is mild left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube is in adequate position, terminating 4.6 cm above the
 carina.
 
 2.  Slight interval worsening of asymmetrically distributed lung opacities,
 likely due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. Short interval followup CXR is
 recommended after diuresis to exclude a pneumonia in the right lung.
