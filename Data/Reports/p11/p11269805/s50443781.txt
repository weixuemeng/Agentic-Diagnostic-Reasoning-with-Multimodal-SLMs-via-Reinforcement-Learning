                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph is compared to prior radiograph dated ___.  Relative to prior study, there is improved aeration of
 bilateral lungs. Patchy parenchymal consolidation seen on previous studies are
 resolved. Linear opacity projecting over the left lower lung zone likely
 atelectasis.  No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia is identified.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are
 without an acute abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity within the left upper lung zone may reflect interval resolution
 of prior bilateral parenchymal consolidations. However since there were no
 subsequent chest radiographs, it could be new pneumonia.
