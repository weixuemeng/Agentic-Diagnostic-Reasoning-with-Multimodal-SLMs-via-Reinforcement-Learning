                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates in standard position, approximately 4.5 cm from
 the carina. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in
 the mid SVC. An enteric tube and side port are within the stomach.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is re- demonstrated. Focal opacities are seen within the
 retrocardiac region as well as ill-defined nodular opacities within the right
 mid lung field. These may reflect areas of developing infection. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal and enteric tubes. Right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.
 2. Focal opacities within the retrocardiac region and right mid lung field,
 which may reflect sites of developing infection.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
