                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding and
 calcification along the thoracic aorta.  The lungs appear clear.  A small
 pleural effusion is suspected on the left.  The left posterior costophrenic
 sulcus is excluded and it is difficult to exclude a pleural effusion on the
 right.  Curvilinear lines project over the right hemithorax, probably
 artifactual and due to soft tissue, noting lung markings which extend fully to
 the periphery in all areas.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Small right-sided pleural
 effusion, but no evidence for congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
