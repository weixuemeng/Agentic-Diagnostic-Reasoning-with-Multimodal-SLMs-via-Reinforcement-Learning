                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with airway protection intubation in setting of alcohol
 withdrawal and GI bleed, now with fever, thick purulent sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is 7.6 cm above the carina.  It should not be higher and could be
 advanced for 1 or 2 cm. Right jugular line and NG tube are in adequate
 position.
 
 Increase in bilateral lower lung opacities, right more than left, is mainly
 explained by volume loss; however, superimposed aspiration or pneumonia can
 also be considered.  If there is pleural effusion it is small.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube could be advanced for 1 or 2 cm.
 2.  Increase in bilateral lower lung opacification, right more than left, is
 mainly explained by volume loss; however, superimposed aspiration or pneumonia
 can also be considered.
 
 The results have been discussed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ on ___ at 6:48 p.m.
