                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Presyncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is stable, top normal.  The ascending aorta
 appears slightly prominent, similar to slightly more prominent as compared to
 the prior study.  While this may be due to an unfolded aorta, tortuosity and
 dilatation of the ascending aorta is not excluded and this could be further
 evaluated with chest CT with contrast.  Mild pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine including anterior osteophyte.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs.
 2.  Mild prominence of the ascending aorta which may relate to tortuosity;
 however, dilatation is not excluded.  Findings could be further evaluated with
 chest CT with contrast.
