  Linear left basal likely atelectasis is seen, early consolidation not
  excluded.
  Prominence of the ascending aorta w/out priors for comparison, underlying
  ascending aortic aneurysm not excluded.  Findings could be further eval on f/u
  chest CT I+

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and mild crackles on exam.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding. 
 Linear left basal likely atelectasis is seen, early consolidation not
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The heart is
 top normal in size with tortuous contour of the ascending aorta.  There is
 prominence of the ascending aorta without priors for comparison, underlying
 ascending aortic aneurysm is not excluded. Findings could be further eval on
 f/u chest CT I+ 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear left basal likely atelectasis is seen, early consolidation not
 excluded.
 
 Prominence of the ascending aorta without priors for comparison, underlying
 ascending aortic aneurysm not excluded and could be further evaluated for on
 follow-up chest CT.
