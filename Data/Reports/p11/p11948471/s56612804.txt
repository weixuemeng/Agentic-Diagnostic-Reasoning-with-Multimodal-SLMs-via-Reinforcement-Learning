                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with worsening cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with the clinical
 diagnosis of chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no acute focal pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, an
 appearance that could reflect pleural thickening or effusion.
