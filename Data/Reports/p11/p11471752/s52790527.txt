 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fall, now failed s/s secondary to high amount
 of secretions  // please evaluate for possible pulmonary process      please
 evaluate for possible pulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Triangular opacity projecting
 over the lower pole the right hilus is probably atelectasis.  Followup with
 conventional chest radiographs when feasible is recommended.  Fractures in the
 left middle ribs and left scapula are healed and incompletely healed in the
 right upper lateral ribs.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Patient has had median sternotomy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
