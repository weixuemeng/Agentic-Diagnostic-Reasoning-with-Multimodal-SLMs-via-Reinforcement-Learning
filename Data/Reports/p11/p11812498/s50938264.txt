 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been substantial decrease in the right pleural effusion since the
 previous radiograph. Re-expansion of the right lower lung is noted with still
 present atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Mild to moderate left pleural effusion is noted, potentially
 minimally increased since the prior study although most likely representing
 redistribution due to slightly different patient positioning
