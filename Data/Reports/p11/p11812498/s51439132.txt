   Low lung volumes and supine radiograph may account for worsening
  opacification within the right lung however developing consolidation or
  layering effusion is possible. There is also increased density within the left
  lung base likely secondary to atelectasis. Lines and tubes unchanged in
  position with PICC tip pointing laterally.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo presenting w/ abdominal pain ___ to likely EtOH
 pancreatitis also found to have a right sided ?empeyema, s/p CT placement on
 ___ s/p R VATS, decortication  // Assess for fluid accumulation/hemothorax in
 R (operative) chest. Please perform ___ at ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased,
 causing an increase in density of the right lung parenchyma. Status post
 decortication. The right chest tubes are in unchanged position. Minimally
 increasing atelectasis at the left lung bases with increase in size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
