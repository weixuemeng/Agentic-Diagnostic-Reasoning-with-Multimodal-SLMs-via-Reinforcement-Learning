 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatitis and persistent O2 requirement 
 // Please assess for effusion or atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
 Still present is right basal opacity and moderate right pleural effusion,
 potentially representing the residual edema but attention to this area on the
 subsequent studies to exclude the possibility of developing infection is
 recommended.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
