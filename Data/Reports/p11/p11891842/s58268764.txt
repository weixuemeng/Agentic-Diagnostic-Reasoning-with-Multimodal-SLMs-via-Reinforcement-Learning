                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and wheezing.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lung volumes are slightly decreased
 with bibasilar patchy opacities. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes, but infection is not excluded.
