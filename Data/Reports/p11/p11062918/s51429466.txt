                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever and cough, non-small-cell lung cancer // Eval for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Right lung is clear.
 There is volume loss in the left lung with perihilar opacity which could
 reflect patient's known malignancy. Difficult to exclude a superimposed
 pneumonia. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The overall cardio
 mediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable from the prior CT allowing for
 differences in modality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar opacity could represent patient's known malignancy though a
 superimposed pneumonia difficult to exclude.
