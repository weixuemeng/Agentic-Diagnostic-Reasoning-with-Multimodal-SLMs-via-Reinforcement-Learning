                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier and CT torso of one day earlier.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A small right apicolateral pneumothorax has increased in size since
 the previous CT torso.  Apical visceral pleural line is currently just below
 the third posterior right rib level.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and without change allowing for differences in technique.  Lungs
 are well expanded and clear except for a patchy area of increased opacity in
 the right lower lobe posteriorly, probably corresponding to a site of known
 pulmonary contusion and laceration injury on the CT of one day earlier.  Known
 T9, T11 and right tenth rib fractures are seen to better detail on the recent
 CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased size of small right pneumothorax since CT of ___,
 as communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 1:16 p.m. at
 time of discovery.
 
 2.  Improving right lower lobe opacity, likely due to resolving contusion.
