                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with endocarditis and intubated.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits 5 cm above the carina.  A left-sided
 IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The
 right-sided IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the upper SVC.  The heart
 size is large but stable.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 There continue to be bibasilar and perihilar opacities as well as a more
 rounded confluent opacity in the right upper lung.  These findings likely
 represent increased pulmonary edema as well as right upper and lower lobe
 consolidations.  Retrocardiac opacity is also compatible with a left lower
 lobe consolidation.  The costophrenic angles are excluded from the study
 limiting assessment for subtle pleural effusion.  There is no large
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Lines and tubes in place. 
 2.  Increased pulmonary edema with right upper lobe and bibasilar
 consolidations.
