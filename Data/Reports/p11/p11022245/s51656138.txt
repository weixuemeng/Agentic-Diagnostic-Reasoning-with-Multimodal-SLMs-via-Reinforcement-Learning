                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, question pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable AP view of the chest.  The Swan-Ganz catheter through
 a right internal jugular approach ends in the region of the main pulmonary
 artery.  The left internal jugular catheter ends in the left brachiocephalic
 vein just before the SVC.  Endotracheal tube ends 6 cm from the carina.  The
 previously seen moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has slightly improved.  The
 right upper lobe parenchymal opacity is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly decreased pulmonary edema compared to most recent study, however
 right upper and lower lobe parenchymal opacities are more prominent and may
 represent pneumonia.  
 
 2.  Lines and tubes are in standard position.
