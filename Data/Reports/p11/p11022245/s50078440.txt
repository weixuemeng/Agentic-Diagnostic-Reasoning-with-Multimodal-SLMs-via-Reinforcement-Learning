                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with CHF versus pneumonia, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate intubated patient,
 the tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned 4.1 cm from the level of the
 carina.  An orogastric tube is in place and is coiled within the fundus of the
 stomach.  There is airspace opacification of the right lung with relative
 sparing of the apex, as well as basilar left lung opacity.  Linear atelectasis
 is seen in the right mid lung.  The left lung is relatively clear.  A focal
 nodular opacity is seen in the left upper lung measuring 8 mm.  There is
 linear atelectasis in the left lower lung.  There is no definite effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 The heart size is enlarged, the mediastinal contours appear grossly
 unremarkable on this portable film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral airspace opacity consistent with lobar pneumonia.
 
 2.  Nodular opacity in the left lung apex, recommend attention on followup.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
