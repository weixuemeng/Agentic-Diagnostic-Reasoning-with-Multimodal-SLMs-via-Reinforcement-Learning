                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, assess for effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and Lateral radiographs
 
 COMPARISONS: Multiple priors most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: Rounded right midlung opacity compatible with previously described
 septic embolus is decreased in size from the prior study. Left midlung rounded
 consolidation is more conspicuous than previously seen. Potential etiologies
 include developing pneumonia, additional septic embolus or collection of
 fissural fluid, though the lateral argues against the latter. 
 
 Small left pleural effusion is noted along with left greater than right
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 similar to the study from ___ though notably larger than the immediate
 post-procedure study from ___. Left PICC is in satisfactory position in the
 superior cavoatrial junction.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve
 replacement are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. More conspicuous left midlung opacity concerning for developing pneumonia
 or septic embolus. 
 2. Improved small left pleural effusion and left greater than right bibasilar
 atelectasis. 
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with ___, NP, by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at ___.
