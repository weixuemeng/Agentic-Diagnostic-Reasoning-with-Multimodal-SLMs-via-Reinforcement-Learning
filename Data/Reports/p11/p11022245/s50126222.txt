                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, recent cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:51, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  Lung volumes are low with mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is
 mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, but infection particularly in
 the left lung base cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again
 noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight improvement in mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis, but infection particularly in the left lung
 base cannot be completely excluded.
