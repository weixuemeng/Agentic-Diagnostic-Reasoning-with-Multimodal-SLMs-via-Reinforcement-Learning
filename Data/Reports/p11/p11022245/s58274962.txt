                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, assess left lung opacity.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rounded bilateral mid lung opacities are again seen, grossly
 unchanged and likely reflect consolidative infectious process given history of
 septic emboli.  There is unchanged bibasilar opacification, which is likely
 atelectasis with left greater than right effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is
 markedly enlarged, similar to the most recent prior.  Left PICC terminates in
 the cavoatrial junction.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged bilateral mid lung opacities likely reflect infectious process
 given history of septic emboli.
 2.  Unchanged or slightly increased left greater than right pleural effusion
 and associated atelectasis.
