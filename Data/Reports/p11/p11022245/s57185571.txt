 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided pleural
 effusion has minimally decreased.  On the left, however, the effusion has
 substantially increased and leads to a near total opacification of the left
 hemithorax.  Subsequently, severe atelectatic changes are present.
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, the right internal jugular vein
 catheter has also been removed, a nasogastric tube, the endotracheal tube and
 a venous introduction sheath remains in situ.
