                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine view of the chest demonstrates diffuse right-sided
 abnormalities with opacities obscuring the mediastinal and hilar contours,
 similar to the prior study. New right upper lobe opacities are present.
 Overall , this is likely a combination of effusion and pulmonary edema
 redistributed compared to the prior study, but superimposed pneumonia can also
 be considered. On the left, there continues to be a left-sided pleural
 effusion as well as edema.  Cardiac size is enlarged.  The patient is status
 post median sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse right-sided opacities have increased, likely reflecting
 redistrubtution of pleural fluid and edema, but superimposed pneumonia can
 also be considered. Small left sided effusion and mild edema.
