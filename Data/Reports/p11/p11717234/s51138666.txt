                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, status post fall, here to evaluate for fluid overload,
 pneumothorax or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  In the interim from the most recent
 prior study, a right internal jugular line has been removed.  Bilateral
 moderate pleural effusions are slightly increased from ___ with
 potentially increase in mild pulmonary edema.  No definitive evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the
 setting of bilateral pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged with calcification of the aortic knob.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy with discontinuous inferior most
 sternal wire, unchanged.  There are acute mildly displaced fractures of the
 right posterior fifth and sixth ribs as well as the lateral right lower ribs,
 possibly seventh and eighth.  No displaced left-sided rib fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Acute mildly displaced fractures of the right posterior fifth and sixth
 ribs and the right lateral lower ribs, possibly seventh and eighth.
 
 2.  No definitive evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Slightly increased bilateral modearte pleural effusions and mild pulmonary
