                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube clamped, to check if there has been redevelopment of
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no
 evidence of hydropneumothorax or pneumothorax.  Right chest tube is in place. 
 There is little change in the degree of left pleural effusion.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragmatic contour persists.  Mild atelectatic changes are
 seen at the left base.
