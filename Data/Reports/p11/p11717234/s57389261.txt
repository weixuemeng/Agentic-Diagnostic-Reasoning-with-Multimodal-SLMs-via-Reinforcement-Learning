                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with right rib pain and hypoxia; evaluate for pneumothorax,
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___, as well as a chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Perihilar distribution of opacities consistent with pulmonary
 edema.  Opacities somewhat obscure mediastinal and hilar contours, though
 there are no gross contour abnormalities evident.  Bilateral large pleural
 effusions with dense opacification in the lung bases likely reflecting
 adjacent compressive atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Minimally displaced rib fractures evident in
 the right posterior sixth and seventh ribs as well as possible non-displaced
 fractures in the eighth and ninth ribs.  Rib fractures were better evaluated
 on concurrent CT.  The patient is status post CABG with sternotomy sutures
 midline and intact.  There is dense mitral annular calcification identified as
 well as aortic valve replacement.  Pacemaker leads tips are positioned in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Multiple right posterior fractures as described above.
