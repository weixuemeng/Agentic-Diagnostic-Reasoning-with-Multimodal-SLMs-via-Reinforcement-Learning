                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hydropneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pigtail
 catheter has been removed.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated. 
 Assessment for possible hydropneumothorax is not possible since this is not an
 upright view and therefore no air-fluid levels could be identified.
