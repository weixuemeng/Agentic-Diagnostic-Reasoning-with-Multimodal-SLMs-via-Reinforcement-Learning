 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p MVC w/ multiple frx incl b/l ribs 1 mo ago, now with
 simple R pleural effusion c/f hemothorax s/p thoracentesis  // Assess for
 pneumothorax and interval change in pleural effusion.     Assess for

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right diaphragmatic region.  The
 right lung base is elevated, but the precise location of the diaphragm with
 regard to the pleural space is indeterminate.  Subpulmonic pleural effusion
 could therefore be present.  Pleural effusion is otherwise small.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinum midline.  Left lung and pleural space normal.
