                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall.  Assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back through ___, including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  There is minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  The
 vascular pedicle is markedly widened, increased compared to the most recent
 radiograph from ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Loss of height of vertebral bodies along the
 thoracolumbar spine do not appear substantially changed compared to the prior
 study from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased widening of the vascular pedicle compared to the most recent
 study from ___.  A dedicated PA upright radiograph is recommended
 for further assessment, as a recently dilated ascending aorta cannot be
 excluded on the provided AP projection.
 
 2.  Minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 3.  Unchanged cardiomegaly.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 9:40 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
