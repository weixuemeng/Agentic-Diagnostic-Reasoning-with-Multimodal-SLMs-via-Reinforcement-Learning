                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB   acute ___ chest pressure  // aortic
 dissection? PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiograph and ___
 portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared to previous
 portable radiograph of ___ when consideration is made for
 differences in positioning. Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and lungs are
 clear. Lateral left costophrenic sulcus is not well demonstrated but has
 similar appearance to previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No portable radiographic findings to suggest pneumonia or complications of
 aortic dissection. However, a portable chest radiograph has a low
 sensitivityive for diagnosing aortic dissection, and dedicated chest CTA may
 be considered if there remains clinical suspicion for this entity.
