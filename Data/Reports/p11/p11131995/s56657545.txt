                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ and shortness of breath  // evidence of
 volume overload versus pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities are present, right more than left, with
 relatively central distribution, that might represent pulmonary edema,
 interstitial and alveolar.  The slight asymmetric appearance in the right mid
 and lower lung might represent superimposed process such is infection or
 hemorrhage, reassessment after diuresis is required. No pneumothorax is seen.
 No definitive masses or consolidations demonstrated. Pleural effusion is
 demonstrated, small, better appreciated on the lateral view, left.
