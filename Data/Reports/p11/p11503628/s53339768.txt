                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p median sternotomy, thymectomy  // Please
 evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral low lung volumes.  Previous right mid lung atelectasis has improved.
 New linear atelectasis in the right lower lung is seen with mild volume loss. 
 Mild pulmonary edema seen in retrospect has improved.  Small pleural effusions
 if any.  No pneumothorax is seen. Decrease in mediastinal widening likely due
 to less venous engorgement.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged..    Two midline
 drains again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mid lung atelectasis has improved but has new linear atelectasis in the
 right lower lung.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema seen in retrospect has improved.
 
 Significant decrease in mediastinal widening primarily due to less venous
 engorgement
