                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with bradycardia, hypotension, TV pacer placed, assess
 central line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest. A transvenous pacing wire is seen
 entering the right IJ with its tip in the region of the right ventricle.
 Multiple overlying EKG leads limit the evaluation. Allowing for this, there
 are coarsened interstitial markings suggestive of underlying emphysema with
 possibly a component of mild edema. No large effusions are seen. Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Transvenous pacer enters right IJ with tip in region of right ventricle.
 Probable mild edema superimposed on a background of emphysema.
