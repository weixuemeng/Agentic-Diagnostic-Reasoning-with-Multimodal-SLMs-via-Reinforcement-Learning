 pleural effusion has decreased in size though persistent volume loss in the
 right lower lobe remains unchanged.  The left lung is fully expanded and
 clear.  Bilateral mediastinal and hilar adenopathy are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in right pleural effusion though right lower
 lobe volume loss persists.
