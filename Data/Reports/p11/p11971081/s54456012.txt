                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been right
 thoracentesis with 700 cc of fluid removed.  Specifically, there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Opacification at the right base most likely represents some residual pleural
 fluid associated with collapse of the right lower and middle lobes.
