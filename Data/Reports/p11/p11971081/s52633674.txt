                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the lung and prior
 pleural effusion on the right, now with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the deep right atrium.
 Large right pleural effusion appears increased in size compared to the
 previous exam.  Bilateral hilar and mediastinal masses compatible with known
 metastatic lymphadenopathy are re-demonstrated.  Right basilar opacification
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Left lung demonstrates no focal consolidation. 
 Small left pleural effusion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is evident.  There are multilevel degenerative changes of
 the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased size of large right pleural effusion with right basilar
 compressive atelectasis.  Trace left pleural effusion.  
 2.  Unchanged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
