 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left side, are
 probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. 
 They are associated with bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Widened mediastinum has improved.  Cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  There are moderate
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Sternal wires are aligned.
