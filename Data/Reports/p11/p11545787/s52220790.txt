                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening falls and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for limitations of technique
 and low lung volumes, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  The lungs appear clear.  A small pleural effusion is suspected on
 the left based on one of two lateral views.  There is also hazy posterior
 opacity projecting over the spine, difficult to characterize as to side, but
 probably in the left lower lobe.  This appearance may be due to minor
 atelectasis or scarring in association with spinal osteophytes, although a
 developing acute process is difficult to entirely exclude in the appropriate
 setting.  The patient is status post incompletely characterized anterior
 cervical fusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy posterior opacity appreciated with limited technique,
 possibly due to atelectasis.  An infectious etiology is difficult to
 completely exclude, however.  If clinical findings suggest pneumonia as a
 potential cause for hypotension, then it may be helpful to consider repeating
 the radiographs with PA and lateral technique when clinical circumstances
 permit.
