 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:23 AM
  Increased opacification at the left lower lung may reflect pneumonia, and/or
  atelectasis. A component of this left lower lobe opacity likely represents the
  consolidative mass seen on prior CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with metastatic cancer of unknown origin, possibly lung,
 presenting with worsening back pain, fevers, increased white count.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.
 Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased left lower lobe consolidation and partial silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm is compatible with known mass and probable worsening
 postobstructive pneumonia and/or atelectasis.  Scattered nodular opacities
 throughout the lungs bilaterally are compatible with multiple nodules better
 seen on prior CT.  The right peritracheal stripe and aorto-pulmonary window
 continue to be prominent, consistent with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 
 Vascular engorgement and indistinctness reflects mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema, worse in the interval.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly
 shifted to the left, unchanged from prior.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacification at the left lower lung is compatible with known
 mass and probable worsening postobstructive pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
 2. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.
