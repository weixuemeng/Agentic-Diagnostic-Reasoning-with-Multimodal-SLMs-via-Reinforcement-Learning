                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Neck mass.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and earlier CT from the
 same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a convex contour to the right upper mediastinum, but shown to reflect
 tortuosity of the innominate artery on the neck CT from the same day and
 similar to the earlier chest radiographs.  Streaky opacity in the lingula
 suggests atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative changes are similar
 along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
