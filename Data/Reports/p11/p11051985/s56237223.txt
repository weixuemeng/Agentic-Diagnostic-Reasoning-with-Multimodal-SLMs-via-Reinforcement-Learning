                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  intubated  // confirm ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the level of the carina.  Enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant.  The
 side port appears to be at the level of the GE junction.  Consider advancement
 so that it is well within the stomach.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.  Areas of
 osseous sclerosis are consistent with reported history of prostate metastatic
 disease.
