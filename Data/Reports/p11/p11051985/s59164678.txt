                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, metastatic prostate cancer // eval acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Again noted are
 diffusely sclerotic appearing osseous structures, particularly in the
 vertebral bodies, consistent with known metastatic prostate cancer; please
 note that this appearance limits the evaluation for subtle parenchymal
 abnormalities. No acute fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse sclerosis of the imaged bones compatible with diffuse metastatic
 disease from prostate cancer.
 2.  Within the limitations of this study, no definite parenchymal
 consolidation is identified.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
