                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, history of heart failure, recent pneumonia. 
 For assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 There is probably some background pulmonary hyperinflation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There
 is residual bronchial wall thickening in both lung zones, particularly the
 right, and I suspect there might be some bronchiectasis.  The significant left
 lower lung zone opacity has effectively resolved.  There is calcification of
 the aortic arch.  Mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries, best appreciated
 on the lateral view.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Interval resolution of pneumonia.  The patient does not have any evidence of
 congestive change on this study.
