                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thick secretion sputum, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 27 minutes after midnight, the ET tube and NG tube
 have been removed.  Again seen is background COPD, with hyperinflation and
 moderate cardiomegaly with unfolded aorta.  There is upper zone
 redistribution.  Doubt interstitial edema.   No focal infiltrate or effusion
 identified, though extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. 
 Possible slight increase in the degree of retrocardiac density.  If there is
 ongoing concern for left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate, then a  lateral view
 may help for further assessment.  Subtle linear density is noted at the left
 lung apex -- I doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny left apical
 pneumothorax. Focal radiodensities in the right axilla are noted, ? dystrophic
 calcification.
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD and cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution.
 2.  No definite infiltrate.
 3.  Curvilinear density at left lung apex, doubt but cannot entirely exclude,
 a tiny pneumothorax.
