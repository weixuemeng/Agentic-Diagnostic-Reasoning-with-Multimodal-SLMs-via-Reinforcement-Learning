                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o smoking, coughing up blood.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a saber sheath configuration of the trachea. Aside from linear
 atelectasis at both lung bases, the lungs are hyperinflated but clear. The
 heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  There is also a nodular opacity projecting over right lower
 lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Clear lungs, with hyperinflation suggestive of COPD. Etiology of hemoptysis
 not elucidated.  CT may be considered to exclude a radiographically occult
 cause of Ma purposes if warranted clinically.
 
 Nodular opacity projecting over right lower lobe is likely due to the right
 nipple shadow, however dedicated nipple views or a chest CT may be obtained
 for confirmation.
