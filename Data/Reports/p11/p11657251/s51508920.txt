                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 23:24.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are seen.  Enteric tube ends off the inferior portion of the image.  A
 right internal jugular central venous line ends in the mid SVC.  Right lower
 lung opacity with air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia is again seen and
 unchanged.  Patchy opacities in the left lower lung also likely represent
 infection or aspiration.  The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm from the carina.  No
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperexpanded which may indicate emphysema. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lung consolidations most likely representing
 pneumonia, right greater than left, without significant change.  Lines and
 tubes in appropriate position.  The lungs are hyperexpanded which may indicate
 emphysema.
