                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough x several days  // r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left chest wall pacer again
 noted with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, new from prior with
 opacity in the left lower lung which likely represents atelectasis given the
 associated volume loss though difficult to exclude a pneumonia in this region.
 Right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity likely atelectasis though difficult to exclude pneumonia.
