                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  A linear opacity with some associated volume
 loss in the right upper lobe is unchanged from the prior radiograph. This
 likely scarring.  No new opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is
 no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperexpanded lungs. No evidence of pneumonia. A linear opacity in the right
 upper lobe is likely scarring, though could be further assessed with a CT if
 clinically indicated.
