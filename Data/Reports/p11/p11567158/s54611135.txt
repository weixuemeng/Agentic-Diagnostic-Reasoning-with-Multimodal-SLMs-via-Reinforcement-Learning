                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of carbon monoxide
 exposure and recent right pleural effusion, crackles on right base.  Assess
 previous pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within
 normal limits.  Also unchanged appearance of mildly widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Mildly elevated
 right-sided diaphragm is unchanged and there appears a mild blunting of the
 right lateral pleural sinus.  This very mild thickening of the lateral pleural
 space along the right lateral chest wall reaches up to the minor fissure which
 also appears to be mildly thickened.  The finding is completely unchanged in
 comparison with the previous study.  The same holds for the appearance of the
 right-sided posterior pleural sinus as seen on the lateral view.  Again, these
 findings are completely unaltered.  Comparison is also extended to chest PA
 and lateral view of ___ where bilateral mild blunting of the pleural
 sinuses was identified.  The left-sided pleural findings had normalized on ___.  Present unchanged appearance of some pleural residuals suggests the
 possibility of scar formations.  No new acute abnormalities are seen.  The
 chest CT examination of ___ is also reviewed.  It demonstrated
 absence of any pulmonary embolism but small pleural effusions on the left side
 and minimal pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of pleural residuals on the right side, most
 likely representing scar formations.
