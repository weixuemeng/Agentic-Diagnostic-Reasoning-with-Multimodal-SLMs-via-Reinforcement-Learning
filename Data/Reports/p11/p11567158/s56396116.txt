                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left costophrenic angle is
 sharply seen with no evidence of pleural effusion on this side.  Little change
 in the opacification at the right base consistent with some fluid in the
 pleural space.
 
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
