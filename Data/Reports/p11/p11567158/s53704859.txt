                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 two exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  New opacity in
 the right mid lung is unchanged, and likely represents scarring or chronic
 atelectasis.  There is new blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles,
 which on the lateral view is consistent with a new right pleural effusion, as
 well as a possible very small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New suspected small subpulmonic right pleural effusion.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
