  Dobbhoff tube has its tip and side port in the stomach. Opacity at the right
  base is incompletely evaluated on this study. Consider dedicated radiographs
  of the chest if clinically necessary. The catheter appears to be in the deep
  right atrium, however its proximal portion is not visualized. Additional
  history from Dr. ___ reveals this to be an HD catheter. Results were

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p feeding tube placement  // Confirm tube
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Coned-down radiograph of the thoracoabdominal junction demonstrates
 advancement of a feeding tube within the stomach.  Distal tip is directed
 cephalad.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent increase in size of right
 pleural effusion, difficult to accurately compare due to positional
 differences and incomplete imaging of the chest.
