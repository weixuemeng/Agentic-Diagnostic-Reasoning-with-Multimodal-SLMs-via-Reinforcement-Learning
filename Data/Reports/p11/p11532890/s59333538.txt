 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p liver transplant now with worsening liver
 function and dropping hct  // evaluate for L hemothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___. impression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is still a disparity in radiodensity of the lungs, greatest in the right
 lower chest. This could be due to localized edema or a posterior pleural
 collection. An upright radiograph, particularly a lateral view would be
 helpful in distinguishing between consolidation or it asymmetric edema in the
 right lung and a right pleural effusion.
 
 Heart size is top-normal. Pulmonary vasculature remains engorged.  Right
 internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
