                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for two weeks.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size is slightly enlarged, but stable since the prior study.  Lungs
 are clear.  Mediastinum is normal in width.  There is slight increase in the
 kyphosis as compared to prior examination, most likely due to decrease in the
 intervertebral disc space and minimal decrease in the vertebral heights at the
 level of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
