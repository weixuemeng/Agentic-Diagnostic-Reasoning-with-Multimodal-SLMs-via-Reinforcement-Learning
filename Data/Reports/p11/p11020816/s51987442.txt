                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There are bilateral coarse irregular lung markings likely
 secondary to COPD.  There is also a minimal left basilar opacity.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Coarse irregular lung markings bilaterally, likely secondary to COPD.
 
 2.  Minimal left basilar opacity may be secondary to subtle pneumonia;
 short-term follow-up chest x-ray may be helpful to reassess.
