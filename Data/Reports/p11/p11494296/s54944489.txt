                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Preoperative for brain surgery.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  In addition to subpleural scarring at the right lung apex,
 there is a vague nodular opacity which measures approximately 15 mm in
 diameter.  An old fracture affects the right anterior lateral ninth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Suspicious nodular opacity at the right lung apex with no short-term
 change but possibly a primary neoplasm.  When clinically appropriate
 evaluation with dedicated chest CT is recommended.
 
 3.  Hyperinflation.
