                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath,
 immunosuppressed, history of DVT and PEs, evaluate for infiltrate or evidence
 of pulmonary embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is present.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic
 aorta and mediastinal structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
 No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Mild
 elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm with mild blunting of the lateral
 pleural sinus, a finding which already was present on the preceding
 examination.  The chest findings are completely unaltered.  There is no
 evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates, pleural effusion.  The pulmonary
 vasculature appears quite unremarkable on both frontal and lateral views and
 thus there is no radiographic suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism.  If
 clinical strong suspicion for pulmonary embolism persists a chest CT with
 contrast would be diagnostic procedure of choice.
