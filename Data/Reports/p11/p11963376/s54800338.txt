 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  There is
 unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right lateral CP angle is due to
 small area of atelectasis in the right lower lobe, better seen in prior CT
 from ___.
