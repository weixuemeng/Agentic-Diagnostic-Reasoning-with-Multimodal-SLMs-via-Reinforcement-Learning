                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities are noted in
 both lung bases, findings which could reflect atelectasis as the lung volumes
 are somewhat low, but infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Infection however cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
