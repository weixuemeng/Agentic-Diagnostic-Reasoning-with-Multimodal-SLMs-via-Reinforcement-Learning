 INDICATION:  Unresponsive.  Evaluate after intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest is obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with
 the tip in the very upper SVC.  A slight kink is noted at the entrance site. 
 An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.6 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is present and coiled within the stomach.  There are patchy
 bilateral interstitial infiltrates, most likely due to mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no focal airspace consolidation.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There may be mild prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with possible prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery.
 2.  Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
