 INDICATION:  Status post transvenous pacemaker for complete heart block.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 13:56.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, via a right internal jugular sheath, there is

 and may be at the junction of the right atrium and IVC.  The endotracheal tube

 The inspiration is slightly improved in comparison to the prior exam.  There
 are persistent bilateral interstitial opacities, consistent with mild edema,
 which appear slightly improved.  There may be a small effusion on the right. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular approach transvenous pacemaker coiled in the right
 atrium but the tip likely at the junction of the right atrium and IVC.
 2.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved.
 4.  Possible small right pleural effusion.
