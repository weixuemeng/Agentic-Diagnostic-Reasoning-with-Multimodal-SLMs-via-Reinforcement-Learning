 There is moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness, slightly more pronounced on the right compared to the left.  A
 moderate right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion are present. 
 Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though superimposed
 infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.

 compressive atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded and followup
 radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
