                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, tracheostomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right-sided paratracheal opacity likely reflects the patient's known
 malignancy.  Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position as is a right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip which terminates in the distal SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Multiple clips are again noted along the mediastinum posteriorly compatible
 with prior esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated, likely atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. 
 There is no focal consolidation.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  Status post
 esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  Tracheostomy tube in unchanged
 position.
