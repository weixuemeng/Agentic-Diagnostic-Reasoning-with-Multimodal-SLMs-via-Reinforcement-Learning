                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal adenocarcinoma, here with
 worsening dysphagia  // R/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No recent prior radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided prepectoral Port-A-Cath in situ with the tip seen in the distal
 SVC.  Evidence of previous gastric pull-through.  Air-fluid level seen in the
 distal stomach (intrathoracic). The density projecting over the lower
 vertebral bodies is presumed to be a fluid-filled stomach. There is
 attenuation of the cervical esophagus with shift to the left in keeping with
 known peritracheal adenopathy.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe in
 keeping with paratracheal adenopathy.  Chronic, healed right-sided rib
 fractures.  No airspace consolidation.  No pleural effusions.    No pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Attenuation of the cervical trachea secondary to peritracheal lymph nodes as
 known.
 
 No new areas of airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 
  This preliminary report was reviewed with Dr. ___, ___
 radiologist.
