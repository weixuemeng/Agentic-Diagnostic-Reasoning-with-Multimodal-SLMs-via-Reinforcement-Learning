 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:25 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known left apical
 pneumothorax is not substantially changed.  No evidence of tension.  Overall,
 the left lung appears better ventilated than before.  Slightly improved
 ventilation is also noted on the right, notably at the lung base.  The cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  The patient continues to carry a nasogastric tube as
 well as the right-sided chest tube and the Port-A-Cath.  Free intra-abdominal
 air appears under both hemidiaphragms.
