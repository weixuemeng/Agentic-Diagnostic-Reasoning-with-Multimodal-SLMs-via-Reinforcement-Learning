                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest tube, evaluation for interval change, questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed left
 chest tube was removed.  There is a persistent small pneumothorax at the left
 lung apex, but no evidence of tension.  On the right, the chest tube is in
 unchanged position.  Also unchanged is the right pectoral Port-A-Cath and the
 nasogastric tube.  Free air continues to be visible in the abdomen.  The lung
 bases appear bilaterally minimally better ventilated; otherwise, there is no
 relevant change in appearance of the lung parenchyma.
