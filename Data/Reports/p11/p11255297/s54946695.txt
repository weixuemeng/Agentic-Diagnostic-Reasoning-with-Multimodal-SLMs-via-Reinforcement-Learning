                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post left lower lobe wedge
 resection, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement persists and is unchanged. 
 The same holds for the moderately widened and somewhat elongated thoracic
 aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no acute new pulmonary
 infiltrates are seen.  As the patient is status post lower lobe wedge
 resection and mediastinal exploration, the presence of the previously
 described three fiducial markers in left-sided perihilar position are again
 noted and additional peripheral markers relate to the area of left lower lobe
 wedge resection.  No new abnormalities have developed and the post-operatively
 seen local pleural thickenings along the lower left lateral chest wall and
 running suture lines in the diaphragmatic surface have decreased in size
 indicating scar formation.  A mild local elevation of the left-sided
 hemidiaphragm at the area of the biopsy persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory regression of post-operative left-sided lower lung
 changes related to wedge resection.
