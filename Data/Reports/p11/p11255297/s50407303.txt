                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  VATS left lower lobe wedge resection, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the air inclusion in the
 left lateral postoperative pleural fluid collection has resolved.  The
 atelectasis at the left lung base has decreased in extent and severity.  The
 right lung base, however, shows minimally newly appeared parenchymal
 atelectatic opacities.  Mild fluid overload is present and unchanged.  An
 air-fluid level is seen projecting over the esophagus, potentially suggesting
 esophagus motility disorder.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
