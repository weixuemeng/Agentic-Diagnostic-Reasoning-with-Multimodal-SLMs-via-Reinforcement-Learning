                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Recent VAT.  History of COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, ___ and ___, as well as earlier
 PET-CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is partly calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar.  There is a widespread mild
 interstitial abnormality suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacities in the left lower lung are probably post-operative including
 visualization of a clip and chain sutures.  The only change is increasing
 fluid within a loculated hydropneumothorax, with corresponding decrease in
 air, located along the left lateral chest wall, of uncertain significance in
 the short-term postoperative course.  Mild degenerative changes are similar
 along the thoracic spine.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the left lateral chest
 wall has mostly resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased interstitial abnormality suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 congestion.
 
 2.  Similar post-operative changes in the left lower hemithorax, aside from
 increased fluid in a left lateral loculated hydropneumothorax with a
 corresponding likely decrease in total air content.
