                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain; recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as chest CT
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips are present along the mediastinum as before.  The
 patient is apparently status post partial gastrectomy.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The esophagus appears
 dilated with an air-fluid level, similar to prior findings.  There is
 persistent patchy opacity in the right lower lobe which has improved somewhat
 since ___, but with little if any change since the prior day.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is similar moderate osteophyte
 formation along the mid thoracic spine.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance including slightly improved opacification in
 the right lower lung reflecting pneumonia seen on the prior CT.  Marked
 dilatation of the esophagus with an air-fluid level as seen previously.
