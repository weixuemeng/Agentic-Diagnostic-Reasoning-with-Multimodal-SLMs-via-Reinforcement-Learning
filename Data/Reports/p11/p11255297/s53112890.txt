 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain, shortness of breath, and
 abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Since prior, there has been interval development of
 right middle and lower lobe parenchymal opacities.  Nodular opacity at the
 left lateral costophrenic angle is again noted, better characterized by a CT
 scan.  Postoperative changes with clips in the posterior mediastinum are again
 noted.  Hiatal hernia is also visualized.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise within normal limits.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle and lower lobar regions of consolidation compatible
 with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Repeat after treatment is
 recommended to document resolution.
