                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent diagnosis of influenza, h/o
 radiation fibrosis, presenting with worsening cough. Possible basilar crackles
 left lung field  // r/o PNA

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vasculature is not particularly
 engorged. Lungs are essentially clear. Left pleural thickening at the site of
 surgery is chronic, and vascular ___ suggest gastric pull-up. The
 combination of the neo esophagus and cardiomegaly displaces the left bronchial
 tree considerably posteriorly.
 
 There is no pleural effusion. Given the evidence of surgery and the
 possibility of recurrent aspiration, the CT scanning might be useful to
 document related changes in the lungs or bronchial tree.
