                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wedge resection with vomiting, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study ___, there is no definite change. 
 Post-surgical changes are again noted.  The area behind the heart is somewhat
 difficult to evaluate and the possibility of an aspiration event in the
 retrocardiac region is difficult to unequivocally exclude.
