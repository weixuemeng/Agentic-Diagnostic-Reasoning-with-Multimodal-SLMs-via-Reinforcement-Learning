                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy and possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is essentially unchanged from prior except for a
 right-sided PICC catheter which is now seen malpositioned, coursing through
 the right subclavian and then upwards into the right internal jugular before
 kinking and turning downward and terminating within the mid SVC.  Tracheostomy
 tube is unchanged position.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinum is stable and within normal limits.  Pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Change in position of right-sided PICC catheter which now travels
 short distance up the right internal jugular before looping downward and
 terminating within the mid SVC.  It is recommended that this right-sided PICC
 catheter be repositioned.  Remainder of the study is unchanged.
