                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:24 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with brain injury, tracheostomy, and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:05 a.m.:
 
 Low lung volumes are responsible for exaggeration of heart size, probably
 normal, as well as pulmonary vascular crowding.  I see no pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in
 the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to place it in the
 lowest third of the SVC.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  No
 pneumothorax.
