                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with DOE 3wk s/p cardiac ablation, history of
 sarcoid
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior cardiac MRI from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   When compared with the prior
 cardiac MRI, there is a similar pattern of hilar and perihilar opacity
 consistent with known sarcoidosis.  Difficult to exclude a subtle superimposed
 pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of edema. 
 Heart size appears unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral hilar and perihilar opacities similar in appearance from prior
 cardiac MR likely reflects known sarcoid.  Difficult to exclude a superimposed
 pneumonia though overall pattern is largely unchanged allowing for differences
 in technique.
