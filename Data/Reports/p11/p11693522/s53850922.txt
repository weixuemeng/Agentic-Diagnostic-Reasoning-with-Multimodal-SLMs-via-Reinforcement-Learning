                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with trauma status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip projects 3.6 cm above the carina. 
 Calcified densities projecting over the lung fields likely correspond to
 calcified pleural plaques seen on CT dated ___.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Engorged left upper lobe vessels may be secondary to mild left heart
 failure.  Mediastinal hardware and sternal wires reflect prior cardiac
 surgery.  Surgical clips project over the epigastric region and region of the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.
 2.  Calcified pleural plaques.
 3.  Engorged left upper lobe pulmonary vessels, which suggest mild left sided
 heart failure. 
 
 Preliminary findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 3:09 a.m.
 on ___ at the time of initial review of the study.
