                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Mediastinitis and pneumonia, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___ radiographs.
 
 As compared to prior studies, there is slight interval improvement in right
 upper lung consolidation with slight decrease in the mediastinal width.  The
 rest of the lungs are essentially clear.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  The lateral view reflects a known air-fluid collection in the
 mediastinum/right upper lung.
