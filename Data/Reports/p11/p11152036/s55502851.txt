                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with gastric cancer, presents with PET-positive
 lymph node and positive AFB.  Cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest compared to previous chest x-ray
 from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 When compared to prior, there has been interval development of a right upper
 lobe region of consolidation in the medial portion of the right upper lobe. 
 Nodular opacities project more laterally in the right upper lobe as well. 
 Given rapid interval development of this finding, it would be most concerning
 for infectious process.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle is compatible
 with previously identified fat-containing hernia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right upper lobe region of consolidation with adjacent
 nodular opacities in the right upper lobe, most worrisome for infectious
 process given short interval development of these findings, TB should be
 considered given history.
