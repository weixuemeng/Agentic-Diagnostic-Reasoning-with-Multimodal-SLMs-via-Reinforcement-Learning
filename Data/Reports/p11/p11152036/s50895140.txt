                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared to
 a scout image from a preprocedural PET-CT dated ___.  New linear
 opacities have developed in both lung bases, likely due to atelectasis
 although coexisting aspiration is possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Known subcentimeter lung nodules were seen to better detail on
 recent PET-CT.  No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening to suggest
 hematoma.  However, if clinical suspicion persists, CT may be helpful for more
 complete evaluation if warranted clinically.
