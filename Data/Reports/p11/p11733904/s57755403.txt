                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 11:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bilateral pneumothoraces status post
 chest tubes.  Assess position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:09.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 11:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral chest tubes remain in place and do not appear to be significantly
 changed in position on this single view.  The endotracheal tube now has its
 tip approximately 5-6 cm above the carina.  There is relative lucency at both
 costophrenic sulci and now at both apices and laterally a pleural line can be
 discerned.  This is consistent with bilateral pneumothoraces, but given that
 the pleural lines were not visible on the previous supine radiograph, raises
 concern for increasing size.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Patchy opacity
 at the right base is again seen and is more streaky in appearance on the
 current study, favoring atelectasis, although pulmonary contusion or
 aspiration should be considered.  Left lung is grossly clear with the
 exception of a subtle patchy opacity in the left mid lateral lung which could
 represent an area of contusion or aspiration.  Probable small pleural
 effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
