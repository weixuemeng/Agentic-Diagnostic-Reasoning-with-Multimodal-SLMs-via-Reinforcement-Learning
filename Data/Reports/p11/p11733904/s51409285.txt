                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:47 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with polytrauma and worsening oxygenation.  Check
 lines and tubes and possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:37 a.m.:
 
 Likely left anterior pneumothorax persists, responsible for hyperlucency
 projecting over the left upper thoracoabdominal region.  Only a small apical
 component is present.  If feasible, upright chest radiographs would be very
 helpful.
 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Right lower lobe is still densely
 consolidated.  No definite right pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
 collection:
 
 With the chin extended, the tip of the endotracheal tube at the upper margin
 of the clavicles is acceptable, but it could be advanced 2 cm for more secure
 seating.  Bilateral pleural tubes unchanged in their respective positions. 
 Mid-esophageal probe, and upper enteric feeding and drainage tubes in standard
 placements respectively.
