                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recurrent metastatic breast cancer p/w
 worsening DOE, known L pleural effusion  // eval effusion, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large left pleural effusion which may be at least partially
 loculated, with likely underlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation for
 pulmonary mass not excluded. No right pleural effusion.
 
 Subtle sub cm nodular opacities projecting over the right upper to mid lung
 could represent vessels on-end but small pulmonary nodules are not excluded.
 No priors for comparison. Suggest non urgent chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
