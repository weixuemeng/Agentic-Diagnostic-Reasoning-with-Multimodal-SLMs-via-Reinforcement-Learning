                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there is little interval change in comparison to prior
 study from ___.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mild to
 moderately enlarged.  There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  Bilateral small pleural effusions with
 adjacent airspace atelectasis are likely present.  Post-surgical changes are
 noted with wiring overlying the left hemithorax and median sternotomy wires. 
 A left subclavian catheter is noted with the tip at the junction of the left
 brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.  Previously noted right-sided PICC
 line has since been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heart failure with moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Left subclavian line with the catheter tip at the junction of the left
 brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.
