                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 opaque wire within the PICC line extends only to the subclavian vein.  There
 then is the suggestion of an ill-defined linear opacity that curls downward
 toward the region of the superior portion of the SVC.  However, it is unclear
 whether this represents a true catheter or merely a fortuitous combination of
 shadows.
 
 This information was telephoned to ___, the IV nurse, indicating that the
 apparent tip of the catheter would be the appropriate distance correlating
 with her evaluation of the relative position of the wire with the tip of the
 tube.  However, it is impossible to be completely certain that this is the
 situation.
