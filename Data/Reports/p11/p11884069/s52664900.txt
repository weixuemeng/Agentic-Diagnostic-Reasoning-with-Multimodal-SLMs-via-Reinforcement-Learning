                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fevers, known lung cancer, infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is a large
 central mass in the right upper and mid lung zones, likely involving the
 mediastinum consistent with patient's known history of lung cancer.  There is
 associated collapse of the right upper lobe. A small cavity in the left mid
 lung zone, as seen on MRI, is likely a metastasis.  There is prominence of the
 interstitial markings.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm suggests phrenic
 nerve involvement from the large lung mass.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right upper lung mass involving the mediastinum,
 specifically the phrenic nerve, also responsible for right upper lobe
 collapse.  Likely left lung metastasis.
