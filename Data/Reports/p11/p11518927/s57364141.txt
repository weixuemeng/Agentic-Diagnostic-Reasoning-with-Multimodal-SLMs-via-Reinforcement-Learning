                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 appear slightly over expanded, but are grossly clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs, which may reflect a vigorous inspiratory level.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, obstructive airways disease such as asthma
 should also be considered.
