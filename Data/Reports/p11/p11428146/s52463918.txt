                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with port placement, minimal drainage, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and PET-CT done yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided PleurX projects in mid hemithorax.  Compared to the previous exam,
 the pneumothorax has decreased in size from 5.1 to 3.5 cm.  As shown on
 yesterday PET-CT, there is almost no more pleural effusion left on that side
 to drain.  The increased density of the right lung is mainly explained by the
 large lung lesion with subsequent atelectasis of right upper lobe and right
 middle lobe.  The left lung is unremarkable and the left pleural effusion is
 small.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient is known with right lung mass with subsequent atelectasis.  Right
 apical pneumothorax has decreased in size and is now moderate.  As shown on
 previous PET-CT, there is almost no more pleural effusion to drain.
