                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right-sided lung cancer, status post airway
 dilation and silicone stent placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right apical air and fluid persists.  There is increased opacification of the
 right lung field, which may represent pleural fluid and/or consolidation. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with rightward mediastinal shift is
 consistent with right-sided volume loss, as seen previously.  Right perihilar
 mass and left lung nodules are better seen on recent prior CT.  Small left
 pleural effusion persists.  Aortic calcifications are noted.  The right
 pleural catheter is similarly positioned.  Stent in the right mainstem
 bronchus is faintly visible.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification of the right lung field, likely secondary to pleural
 effusion and/or consolidation.
