                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of non-small cell lung cancer and worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiographs from
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is increased opacification of the right
 lung with associated volume loss.  A right pleural effusion appears unchanged.
 Post-surgical changes at the right apex are stable.  There is persistent
 rightward tracheal deviation, which is stable.
 
 Worsening left lower lobe opacification could be due to an increasing pleural
 effusion or a new consolidation.  Diffuse interstitial opacities appear to be
 worsened, suggestive of increasing pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to evaluate given the pulmonary abnormalities.  It
 appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left lower lobe opacification could be due to pneumonia or an
 enlarging left pleural effusion.
 2.  Probable mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Diffuse opacification and volume loss of the right lung is likely due to a
 combination of post-surgical changes, the known hilar mass, and possible
 worsening atelectasis.
