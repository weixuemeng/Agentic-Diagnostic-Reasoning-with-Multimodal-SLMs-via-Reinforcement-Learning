                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with end-stage dementia and new hypoxia.  Evaluate
 for worsening effusion or atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax which likely represents a combination of
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  There is no major shift of the
 mediastinum.  Over the interval, there has been slight increase in the
 right-sided pleural effusion, which is still small.  A right IJ central venous
 line is seen with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax indicates
 enlarging pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
