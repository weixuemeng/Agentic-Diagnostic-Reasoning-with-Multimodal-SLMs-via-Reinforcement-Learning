 pleural effusion may now be loculated.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube and
 endotracheal tube.  A right central venous line is seen with the tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires are seen in place.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable to slightly improved right-sided pleural effusion and
 worsening left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and possible
 component of loculation.
