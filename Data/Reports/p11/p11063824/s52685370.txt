 above the carina in appropriate position.  A nasogastric tube has its tip
 terminating in the gastric fundus with the proximal side hole at the GE
 junction.
 
 There is a new focal opacity in the right mid lung.  The left lung is clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are
 stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central venous line with tip terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 2.  New focal opacity in the right mid lung, which could indicated pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 3.  NG tube with proximal side port at the level of the GE junction and may be
 advanced further for optimal positioning.
 
 Finding #3 was discussed with Dr.___ by Dr.___ ___ telephone at 5:30pm on day
