                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, unclear potential pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 substantially decreased.  As a consequence, there is crowding of the vascular
 structures at the lung bases.  However, there are bilateral additional
 parenchymal opacities that could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The opacities are bilateral and symmetrical but do not fulfill the
 classical criteria for pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 8:24 a.m., on ___, the
 referring physician, ___. ___, covered by Dr. ___, was paged for
