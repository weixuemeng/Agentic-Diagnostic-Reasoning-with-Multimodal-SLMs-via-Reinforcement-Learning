                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dementia, status post fall with SAH and
 rib fracture, now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  Assess for
 respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung is well inflated with increased opacification of the right
 lower lobe, which is likely atelectasis.  In appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed pneumonia should be considered.  Left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is still mildly enlarged. No evidence
 of rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in the right lower lobe, compatible with
 atelectasis though superimposed pneumonia might be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
