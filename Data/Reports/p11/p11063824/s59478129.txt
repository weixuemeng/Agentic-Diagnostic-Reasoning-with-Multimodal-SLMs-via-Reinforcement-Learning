                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with rib fractures of the right 11th rib.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates right basilar
 atelectasis with small right pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  At the
 right lower lateral aspect of the thoracic cage, there is a subtle change in
 contour of the rib, possibly indicating the reported rib fracture, although
 oblique views are recommended for further characterization if rib fractures,
 if clinically indicated.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and no
 pneumothorax.
