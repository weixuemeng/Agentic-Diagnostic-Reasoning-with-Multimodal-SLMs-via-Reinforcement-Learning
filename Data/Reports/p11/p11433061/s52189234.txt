                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met breast  // on long-term trastuzumab
 therapy, pain at POC site radiating to back.  Please evaluate if line has
 migrated?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest wall subclavian approach port is noted with tip terminating in
 standard position at or just below the cavoatrial junction. The line does not
 appear to have migrated, although is somewhat difficult to assess given
 absence of conventional chest radiograph after placement of the port.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is persistent. There is no pleural effusion.  Lucency at the
 right lung apex with an apparent pleural line is noted, which may represent a
 small pneumothorax. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 Right lower lobe atelectasis is present. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. Surgical
 clips are present in the right breast with asymmetric increase of the right
 breast tissue, consistent with breast reconstruction. Sclerosis with
 compression deformity in the T2 vertebral body is again seen, stable compared
 to the chest CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right chest port in standard position.
 2.  Possible small right apical pneumothorax. Repeat chest radiograph with
 expiration views is recommended.  During this repeat exam, care should be
 taken to ensure that nothing is overlying the patient.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 12:21 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
