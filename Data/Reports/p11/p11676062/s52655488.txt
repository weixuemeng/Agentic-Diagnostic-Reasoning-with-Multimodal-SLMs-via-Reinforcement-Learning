 events now w/ new oxygen requirement  // evaluate for consolidations or
 evolving PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Geographically marginated opacities in the right paramediastinal
 region are similar, but have progressed compared to an earlier radiograph of
