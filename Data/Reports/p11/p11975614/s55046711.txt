                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // atelectasis vs. mucus plug     
 atelectasis vs. mucus plug
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is further
 opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with increasing severity of the right pleural effusion with volume
 loss on the right lower lobe.  Continued substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe, though less prominent than on the previous study, consistent with
 a expectoration of a mucous plug.  The cardiac silhouette appears to be in the
 midline on the current study.
