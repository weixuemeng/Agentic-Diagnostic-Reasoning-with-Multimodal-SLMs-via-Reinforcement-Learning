                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Single ___ rod is seen within the thoracolumbar spine
 which demonstrates moderate S-shaped scoliosis as before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.
