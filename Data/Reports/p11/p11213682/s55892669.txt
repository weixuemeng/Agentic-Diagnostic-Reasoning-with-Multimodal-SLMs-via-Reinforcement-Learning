                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mental retardation with productive cough, seizures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is likely within normal limits. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.
 Infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Single ___ rod is seen within the thoracolumbar spine
 which demonstrates a moderate S-shaped scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  Please
 note that infection however is not completely excluded.
