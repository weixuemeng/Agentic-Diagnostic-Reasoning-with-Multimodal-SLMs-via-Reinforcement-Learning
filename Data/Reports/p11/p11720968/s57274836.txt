                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest tube for malignant pleural effusion,
 found to have empyema/PNA on CT chest  // acute process/change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Positional differences limit comparison to recent radiograph of ___, and a large loculated left pleural fluid collection is probably similar
 to the recent study considering this factor.  Left pleural catheter is in
 place.  Note is made of apparent worsening of adjacent opacification in the
 lingula and left lower lobe, which could be due to worsening pneumonia and/or
 atelectasis.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for pulmonary vascular congestion
 and minimal interstitial edema in the right lung.
