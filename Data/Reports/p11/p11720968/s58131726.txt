                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from outside institution ___ and chest
 radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemi thorax is re- demonstrated. On the
 previous CT examination, this finding appears to be due to the presence of a
 large pleural effusion combined with multiple pleural masses and pleural
 thickening.  There is mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  Right
 sided PICC tip terminates in the right atrium.  The right lung demonstrates
 atelectatic changes in the lung base.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 pneumothorax is present, and no right-sided pleural effusion is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Complete opacification of the left hemi thorax due to the presence of a
 large pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and multiple pleural masses,
 better depicted on previous CT.
 2. Mild right basilar atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
