  ETT ends 2.5 cm above the level of the carina.  Enteric ___ ends within the
  stomach.  Low lung volumes with right lower lobe heterogeneous opacities,
  likely mild atelectasis.  A small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 which may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
 
 Opacification at the bases is consistent with small effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.
