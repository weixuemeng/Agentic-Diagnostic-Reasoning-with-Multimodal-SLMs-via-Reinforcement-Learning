                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Nasogastric tube has been removed and right PICC line extends to the
 mid portion of the SVC.
 
 There is increased opacification at the right base with poor definition of the
 heart border.  Although this could represent crowding of vessels, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously
 considered.  Some atelectatic changes are seen in the retrocardiac region at
 the left base.
