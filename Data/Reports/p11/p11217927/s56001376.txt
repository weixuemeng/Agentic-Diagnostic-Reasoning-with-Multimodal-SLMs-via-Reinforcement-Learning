                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sickle cell and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP & Lat
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a moderately enlarged heart and
 low lung volumes, though size is inadequately evaluated given AP technique. 
 Retrosternal density is noted, possibly reflective of mediastinal fat though
 anterior mediastinal soft tissue lesion cannot be excluded. Additional
 lordotic positioning likely exaggerates heart size. There is no overt
 pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right
 internal jugular central line is identified, its tip which terminate within
 the right atrium. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Borderline cardiomegaly exaggerated by positioning.
 2.  Anterior mediastinal density may reflect prominent mediastinal fat though
 soft tissue lesion cannot be excluded.  Two lateral films, one with arms
 raised overhead and an additional view with arms pulled back is advised to
 better visualized anterior mediastinal compartment.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings communicated to the ___ nurses after patient had left
 the ED department.
