 extending from right posterior second through fifth ribs. Second rib fracture,
 anterior fracture fragment is anteriorly displaced and demonstrates periosteal
 reaction consistent with subacute or chronic component.  No definite acute
 fracture identified although correlation with physical exam is suggested.
