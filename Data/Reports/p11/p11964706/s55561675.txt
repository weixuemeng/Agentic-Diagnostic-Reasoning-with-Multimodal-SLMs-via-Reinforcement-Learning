                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAD/SAH  // NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been placement of a new feeding tube whose tip is too high and is
 above the GE junction. This could be advanced 15 cm for more optimal
 placement. Heart size is prominent.  There is again seen prominence of the
 pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema as well as
 multiple airspace opacities more confluent within the lower lobes.  The
 right-sided central venous line with the distal tip in the proximal right
 atrium is unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces.
