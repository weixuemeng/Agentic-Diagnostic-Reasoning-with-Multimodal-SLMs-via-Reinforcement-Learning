                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation SAH // ?Tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___, 1.5 hours
 earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube
 enters the stomach. There are diffuse nodular parenchymal opacities. For
 example in the right upper lung there is a 1.5 cm nodule. The lung volumes and
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion have improved compared to the prior chest
 radiograph performed 1.5 hours prior. The cardiac contours are obscured by the
 dense parenchymal opacities but the heart size is likely normal. No
 pneumothorax. Cervical hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in appropriate position. If the
 endotracheal tube was advanced it would be too low.
 
 Compared to the prior chest radiograph the lung volumes have improved and the
 pulmonary edema has decreased.
 
 Diffuse nodular lung parenchymal opacities could represent residual edema,
 multifocal infection or nodules.  Once the patient has stabilized, dedicated
 CT chest is recommended.
