 projecting in the left mid lung overlying the anterior left fourth rib
 corresponds to subpleural radiation changes on prior CT.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without consolidation, effusion, or edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Surgical clips project over the left
 breast.  Oblong calcific densities are also seen in that region, unchanged and
 are within the breast tissues on prior CT.
