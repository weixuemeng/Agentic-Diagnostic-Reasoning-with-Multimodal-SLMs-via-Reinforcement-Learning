                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and tenderness to palpation in left lateral ribs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The hila
 bilaterally are somewhat prominent, and this could be due to underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 A peripheral triangular opacity within the left lung base could reflect an
 area of infarction though infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural
 effusion is also demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  No displaced fractures
 are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Peripheral triangular opacity within the left lung base could reflect an area
 of infarction or infection, with small left pleural effusion.  A chest CTA is
 suggested for further assessment if there is concern for pulmonary embolism. 
 No displaced rib fractures are seen.
