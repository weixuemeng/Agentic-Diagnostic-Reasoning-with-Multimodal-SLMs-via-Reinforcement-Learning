                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT torso from ___ as well a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain.  Assess for right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A left rib cage
 deformity is again noted.  There is a subtle opacity projecting over the left
 lateral mid lung which could reflect pleural thickening subjacent to the
 extensive rib deformity.  This finding is essentially unchanged from multiple
 prior exams.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The left clavicular mid shaft appears
 fractured, appearing new from prior exam though suboptimally assessed. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Left rib cage deformity is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Stable opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung underlying the rib cage
 deformity likely represents pleural thickening and scarring which appears
 unchanged from multiple prior exams.  
 2.  Apparent left mid clavicular shaft fracture, question new injury from
 prior exam.  Please correlate clinically.  
 3.  No evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia.
