                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest supine and semi-upright portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are likely exaggerated by AP supine, AP technique, however, if
 there is concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CT is more sensitive. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette may be exaggerated by low lung volumes and
 supine, portable AP technique, however, if there is concern for an acute
 mediastinal process, CT is more sensitive.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
