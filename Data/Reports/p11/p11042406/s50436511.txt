                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There are low lung volumes
 which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Hazy and streaky
 left lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal
 loss of height anteriorly of a lower thoracic/upper lumbar vertebral body is
 unchanged.  Remote left posterior rib fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky and hazy left lower lobe opacity which could reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
