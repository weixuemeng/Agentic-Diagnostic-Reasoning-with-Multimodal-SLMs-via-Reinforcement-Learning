 INDICATION:  Pancreatic cancer status post exploratory laparotomy, open
 cholecystectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy.  Status post central line removal in
 PACU; rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An NG tube extends below the diaphragm.  An epidural catheter is in
 place.  A right Port-A-Cath ends in the inferior vena cava, approximately 5 cm
 below the cavoatrial junction, which is changed from prior when it terminated
 in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  Central
 vascular engorgement and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Right Port-A-Cath ends in the IVC.  Recommend pulling back by
 approximately 5 cm if desired location is cavoatrial junction.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
