                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and right clavicular pain status post fall. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears to be enlarged, but this may be due to technique.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be enlarged, but this may be due
 to technique.  Recommend non-emergent frontal PA radiograph at full
 inspiration to rule out cardiomegaly.
 
 These findings were communicated via the ED QA nurses at 8:45 a.m. on ___.
