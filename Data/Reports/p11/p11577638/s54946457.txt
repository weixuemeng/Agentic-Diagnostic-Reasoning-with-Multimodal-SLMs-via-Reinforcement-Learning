                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, subjective fevers  // Evaluate for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified and the aorta
 is mildly tortuous, as seen previously.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted
 in both lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
