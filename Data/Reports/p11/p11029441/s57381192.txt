 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, questionable resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is ongoing resolution
 of the pre-existing pneumonia at the right lung bases and in the lingula,

 left heart border.  No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.  No pleural
 effusions.  No other complications.
