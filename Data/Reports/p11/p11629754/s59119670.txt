                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HX OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE- d/c BS rt base  // HX OBSTRUCTIVE
 JAUNDICE- ? effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear within normal limits.  There
 are no focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There are slightly low lung volumes with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  However, there does not appear to be definite pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pleural effusion or other acute cardiopulmonary process.  The
 elevation of the right hemithorax appears new when compared to the prior
 examination from ___, and with the history of obstructive jaundice,
 hepatomegaly as seen on the recent MRCP is likely contributing to the
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, and may also be the cause of decreased
 breath sounds.
