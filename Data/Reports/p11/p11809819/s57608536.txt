                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sharp midsternal chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Increased interstitial opacities bilaterally suggests mild
 pulmonary edema.  More focal opacity in the right lung base could reflect
 atelectasis or infection, and there is and associated small to moderate right
 pleural effusion, for which a sub pulmonic component may account for the
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion.  More focal opacity in
 the right lung base may reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is not excluded. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is of unknown chronicity and may
 partially be attributable to a subpulmonic component of the pleural effusion,
 but underlying subdiaphragmatic/ hepatic process is not excluded.
