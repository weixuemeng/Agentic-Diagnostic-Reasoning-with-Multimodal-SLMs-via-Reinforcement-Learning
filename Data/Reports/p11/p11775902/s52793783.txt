                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with with mild cognitive decline presents with
 dizziness concerning for new intracranial bleed vs infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result and appears
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is no pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases which may reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded, however,
 and consider a follow-up PA and lateral view of the chest with improved
 inspiratory when the patient is able to do so.
