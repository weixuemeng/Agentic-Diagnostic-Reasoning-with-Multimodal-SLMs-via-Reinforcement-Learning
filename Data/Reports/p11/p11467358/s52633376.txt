 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the right lower lung
 is a possible lung nodule suggested by a nodular focus measuring about 7 mm in
 diameter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or injury.  Possible nodule in the
 right lower lung.  If clinically appropriate, the chest could be evaluated
 with CT or alternatively short-term followup radiographs.
