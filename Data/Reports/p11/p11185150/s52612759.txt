                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset of possible CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms, that could reflect some chronic pulmonary disease.  Apical
 pleural thickening is again seen on the right.  However, no evidence of acute
 pneumonia.
 
 Specifically, no cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
