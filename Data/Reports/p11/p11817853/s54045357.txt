                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question septic emboli or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a streaky opacity projecting over the
 left mid lung, probably in the lingula, which is suggestive of atelectasis,
 but which could potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left mid lung opacity, probably in the lingula, which
 could be seen with minor atelectasis, although early pneumonia is also a
 possibility in the appropriate clinical setting.
