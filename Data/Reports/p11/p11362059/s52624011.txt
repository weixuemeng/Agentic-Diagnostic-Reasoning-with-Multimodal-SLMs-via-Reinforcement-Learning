                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath.  Left-sided rib fracture after
 falling off of roof three weeks ago.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS: NONE
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and Lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidations
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a subtle fracture at the left anterolateral seventh rib, mildly
 displaced as well as a possible subtle fracture of the left posterolateral
 eighth rib.  In the absence of priors, this is of indeterminate chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified.  Subtle displaced fractures
 involving the left seventh and eighth ribs of indeterminate chronicity.  If
 there is further concern for rib fractures, a dedicated rib series would be
 recommended for further evaluation.
