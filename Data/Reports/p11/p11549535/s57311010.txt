                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and congestion, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests
 some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
