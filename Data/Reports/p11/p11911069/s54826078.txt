                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.  Evaluate position of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___;
 CT Chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is intubated. The endotracheal ends 4.3 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube follows its expected course although the tip is
 not visualized.  A right Port-A-Cath and left internal jugular catheter end in
 the mid SVC.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are  unchanged on the left and
 slightly increased on the right with adjacent atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  Mild
 cardiomegaly persists. 
 
 Soft tissue density adjacent to the lateral aspect of the aortic knob is newly
 appeared, unlikely to be caused by known prevascular lymph nodes. This in
 conjunction with the left pleural effusion are concerning for dissection. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube follows
 the expected course.  
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the right, with adjacent
 atelectasis.
 
 3.  New soft tissue density adjacent to the aortic arch. This, in conjunction
 with the left pleural effusion, is of concern for dissection but could
 represent artifact. Further evaluation is recommended with repeat radiograph
 with less patient rotation or CTA.
 
 Findings and recommendations ___ by phone at 11:21am ___ after
 attending review.
