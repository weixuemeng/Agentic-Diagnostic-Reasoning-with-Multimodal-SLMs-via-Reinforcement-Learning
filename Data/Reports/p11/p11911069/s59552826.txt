                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with RA lymphoma, status post mediastinal tubes.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Widened
 mediastinum is unchanged.  Small-to-moderate right effusion tracking in the
 minor fissure is stable.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac
 opacities have minimally improved consistent with improving atelectasis. 
 Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Left upper lobe
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Left PICC tip is in unchanged position.  Sternal
 wires are aligned.  If a mediastinal tube is present, cannot be seen due to
 technique.
