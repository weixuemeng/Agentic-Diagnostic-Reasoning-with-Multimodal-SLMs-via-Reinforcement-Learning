                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Repeat radiograph to evaluate aortic knob soft tissues seen on
 the prior study.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm above the carina.  The right Port-A-Cath and
 left internal jugular catheter end in the mid SVC.  An orogastric tube follows
 the expected course, although the tip is not visualized.
 
 Soft tissue density adjacent to the aortic knob is again noted, unchanged in
 appearance from the prior study.  This may represent pneumonia, but remains
 concerning for dissection given the unchanged left pleural effusion.  A small
 right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Soft tissue density adjacent to the aortic arch may be due to
 pneumonia, but could represent dissection given the left pleural fluid and
 history of PEA arrest.  If further imaging is needed, CTA would be the next
 step.  
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:40 p.m. on ___.
