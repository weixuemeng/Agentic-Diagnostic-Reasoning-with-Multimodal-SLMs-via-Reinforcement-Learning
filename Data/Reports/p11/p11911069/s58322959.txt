 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiac mass and shortness of breath, evaluation for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has a minimal
 increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette.  The pre-existing left pleural
 effusion has slightly increased and leads to retrocardiac atelectasis.  On the
 right, a pleural effusion has newly occurred.  In the well ventilated lung
 areas, there is no evidence of pathological opacities suggesting pneumonia.
