                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a new cough who presents for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low. There has been an interval slight increase
 in opacification in the right lower lobe compared to the prior study.  No
 other new focal consolidations are seen.  There is evidence of slight
 bilateral vascular engorgement, without evidence of frank interstitial edema.
 Areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions as well as minimal
 blunting of the left constphrenic sinus persist in an unchanged manner. There
 is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath and a
 right-sided PICC line which terminates in the superior SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New slight increase in opacification in the right lower lobe may be secondary
 to pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
