                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac mass with dysphagia now recently eating, to assess for
 aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the right
 base has essentially cleared.  Some residual opacification at the left base is
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. 
 Specifically, no evidence of acute aspiration event.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Port-A-Cath is unchanged in
 position.
