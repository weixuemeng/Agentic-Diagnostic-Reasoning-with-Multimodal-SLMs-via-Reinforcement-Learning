                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neck mass with chronic dysphagia and low-grade fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 opacification in the retrocardiac region with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small effusion. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinct pulmonary
 vessels raising the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Port-A-Cath remains in place.
