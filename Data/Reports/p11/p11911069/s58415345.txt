  Vascular congestion and cardiac size is intervally increased with perhaps mild
  pulmonary edema.  Trace effusions are present bilaterally.  Dense retrocardiac
  opacity and fainter RLL opacities could be due to aspiration or atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Possible aspiration, increasing work of breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally
 increasing pulmonary edema, causing perihilar haze and an increased diameter
 of the pulmonary vasculature.  The areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac
 lung regions as well as a minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus
 persist in unchanged manner.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  No safe
 evidence of a right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged right
 pectoral Port-A-Cath and right PICC line.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal
 wires.
