                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:20 A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with worsening cough and immunosuppression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Consolidation in the left lower lobe has been present for several weeks,
 presumably atelectasis.  Greater opacification at the base of the right lung
 today than ___ could be due to increasing small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion but needs followup to exclude developing consolidation.  As a
 general rule, conventional radiographs would be more revealing in this patient
 than the bedside variety.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is very mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion in the upper lungs, but I do not believe pulmonary edema is
 present.
 
 Left PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax.
