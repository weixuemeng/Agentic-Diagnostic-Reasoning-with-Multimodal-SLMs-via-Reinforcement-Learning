                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved
 compared to the previous exam.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again
 demonstrated with linear opacities within the right base compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Minimal streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region
 also is compatible with atelectasis, and overall the aeration of the lung
 bases is improved compared to the previous exam.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are multiple clips within the left axillary
 region.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, improved compared to previous exam, with interval
 improvement in degree of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Chronic
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
