 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever of unknown
 source.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The hila
 remain prominent due to vascular engorgement.  Bibasilar opacities are seen,
 which could relate in part to fluid overload; however, underlying infection
 may be present.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
