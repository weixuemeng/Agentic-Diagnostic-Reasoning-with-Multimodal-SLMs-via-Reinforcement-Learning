                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and patient with HIV.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is diffuse heterogeneous opacity
 within the bilateral lower lobes, which has improved from the prior study. 
 Heart size is top normal and unchanged.  There is bilateral fullness within
 the hila, as well as convexity of the azygoesophageal recess likely reflecting
 the patient's known lymphadenopathy.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities, left worse than right, are
 concerning for pneumonia given the patient's clinical history.  There is
 interval improvement from the prior chest radiograph.
