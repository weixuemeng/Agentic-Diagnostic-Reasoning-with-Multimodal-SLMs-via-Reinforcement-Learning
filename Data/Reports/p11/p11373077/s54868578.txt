 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is new elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with associated volume loss in the right lower and mid lung
 zone.  A component of a subpulmonic effusion with associated consolidation
 cannot be completely excluded.  The right apex is clear.  The left lung is
 clear.  There is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and
 stable from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New volume loss in the right middle and lower lung with
 associated elevation of the hemidiaphragm.  A component of subpulmonic
 effusion and/or consolidation cannot be completely excluded.
