 cardiac silhouette is similar compared to the previous exam.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm persists with adjacent atelectasis in the right lung base
 noted.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable trace right
 pleural effusion is also likely present.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.

 hemidiaphragm with adjacent right basilar atelectasis.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
