                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest pain and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors including chest x-ray ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mild pulmonary
 edema.  Linear atelectasis is seen within the left lower lung.  There is no
 new effusion or pneumothorax.  An inferiorly placed central venous catheter
 tip is noted at the cavoatrial junction.  The mediastinal contours are notable
 for slight prominence of the right paratracheal stripe consistent with
 patient's known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The right main pulmonary artery
 appears enlarged, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary arterial enlargement, better
 seen on previous CT.
 3.  Inferiorly placed central venous catheter with distal tip projecting over
 the cavoatrial junction.
