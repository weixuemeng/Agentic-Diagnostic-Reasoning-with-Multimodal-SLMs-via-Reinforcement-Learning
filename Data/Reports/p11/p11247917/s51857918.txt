 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:46 PM
  Right chest wall port catheter terminates in the right atrium.  There is new
  elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and increased opacification of the
  retrocardiac region, which likely represents atelectasis, however underlying
  pneumonia cannot be completely excluded on this portable frontal view.  No
  large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma on revlimid, cough //
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pectoral Infuse-A-Port terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.
 Increased opacification at both lung bases is likely due to a combination of
 subsegmental atelectasis and prominent overlying soft tissues.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite radiographic evidence of pneumonia. However, if clinical suspicion
 remains high, a chest CT may be obtained for further evaluation.
