                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old woman with cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate a minimal left lower lobe opacity,
 similar to the prior radiographs.  This likely represents atelectasis.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis, similar to the prior study.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
