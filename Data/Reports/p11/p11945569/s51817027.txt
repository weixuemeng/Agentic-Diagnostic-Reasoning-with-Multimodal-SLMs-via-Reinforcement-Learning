                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left sided pleural effusion s/p
 thoracentesis  // interval changes s/p thoracentesis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination dated ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 A left-sided battery pack obscures a portion of left heart border.  3 leads
 again noted.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density.  This appears similar, but
 slightly more confluent and dense than on the prior study.  The previously
 seen locule of air projecting over the cardiac silhouette is no longer
 visualized, the small air bronchograms remain visible.  A small right effusion
 is similar to the prior study.  Doubt overt CHF.  Nodular pleural thickening
 again noted at the right lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Based on the available film, it is difficult to confirm interval improvement
 in a left pleural effusion.  The confluence of density at the left lung base
 is actually slightly greater.  However, the position of the left hemidiaphragm
 is uncertain an much of the density is accounted bite by pleural fluid remains
 uncertain.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Elsewhere, doubt significant interval change.
