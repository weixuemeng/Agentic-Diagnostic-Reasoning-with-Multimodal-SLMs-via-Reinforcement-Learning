                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis  // r/o
 PTX, any abnl
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Left-sided pacemaker is present, lead tips unchanged. 
 This obscures small portion of the left lateral chest.
 
 Compared with the prior film, catheter at the left lung base is no longer
 visualized.  Otherwise, the appearance is similar, except for slight increase
 in the amount of increased retrocardiac density --___ could reflect some
 increased pleural fluid and/or collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 The ovoid lucency seen medially, as before, could represent a small amount of
 loculated pneumothorax.  No pneumothorax is seen at the left lung apex.
 
 The appearance of the right lung is unchanged, with a small right base pleural
 effusion, but otherwise no infiltrate or consolidation.  No right-sided
 pneumothorax.
 
 No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left base catheter no longer seen.  Slight interval increase in degree of
 retrocardiac opacity/left base fluid.
 
 As before, loculated pneumothorax at the right base medially cannot be
 excluded, similar to prior.  Alternatively, this could represent aerated lung,
 in the context of left base opacity.
 
 Small amount of right base pleural fluid is unchanged.
