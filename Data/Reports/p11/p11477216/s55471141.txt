                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Some increased vague density of the lower lung fields on lateral view could
 suggest bronchiectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Numerous surgical clips project over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  
 2.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  
 3.  No overt traumatic findings though dedicated rib series may be helpful if
 there is focality.  
 4.  Possible suggestion of bronchiectasis in the lower lung fields.
