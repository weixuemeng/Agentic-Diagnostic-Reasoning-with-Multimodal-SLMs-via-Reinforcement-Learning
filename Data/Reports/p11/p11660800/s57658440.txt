                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CABG, endocarditis, upper GI bleed, question pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Midline sternotomy
 wires are again noted.  There is left basilar opacities which are compatible
 with worsening effusion and consolidation.  The right lung is clear.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  There is
 a left arm PICC line with tip in unchanged position within the expected
 position of the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increased opacity at the left lung base is concerning for
 worsening effusion and consolidation.
