                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, they are still low lung volumes
 which may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Pulmonary vascularity is now essentially within normal limits. 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base and there are bilateral pleural
 effusions seen on the upright lateral view.
 
 The left subclavian catheter remains in position and the right IJ sheath has
 been removed.
