                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a left-sided chest tube, there is no visible
 pneumothorax.  Other indwelling support and monitoring devices have been
 removed with a residual left internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in
 place.  Marked postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal contours is
 stable in the postoperative period, but represents a change from the
 preoperative radiograph of ___.  Mild perihilar edema is new, and
 left retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly worsened in the interval and is
 likely accompanied by an adjacent small left pleural effusion.
