                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diaphragmatic repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices are essentially unchanged.  There is again substantial
 opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  The apparent shift of the mediastinal contents to the left
 may merely be a reflection of obliquity of the patient towards that side. 
 Hazy opacification, especially at the left base is consistent with pleural
 fluid.  The right lung is essentially clear.
