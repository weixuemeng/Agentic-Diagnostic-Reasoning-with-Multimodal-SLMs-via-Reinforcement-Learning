 tachycardia/hypotension, abdominal pain

 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, with no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar atelectasis.
