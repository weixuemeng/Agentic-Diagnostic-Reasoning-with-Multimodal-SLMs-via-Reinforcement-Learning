                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AIDS, sepsis, needs feeding tube  // eval
 NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two sequential AP upright views of the chest obtained portably,
 labeled first and second.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 7:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On view # 2, the radiopaque tip of the Dobbhoff tube extends slightly beyond
 the inferior edge of this film, but overlies the upper/mid abdomen in the
 midline.  The radiopaque tip of the Dobbhoff tube could still lie within the
 stomach.
 
 Compared to the prior film, inspiratory volumes are lower, with more patchy
 opacity at the lung bases.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and vascular
 plethora, compatible with mild fluid overload.  No pleural effusions.
 
 Left PICC line with tip over distal SVC again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiopaque tip of Dobbhoff tube most likely still lies within the stomach.
 
 Worsening retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Increased vascular plethora.  Clinical correlation is
 requested.  It is possible that these findings are accentuated by lower
 inspiratory volumes on the current radiograph.
