                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure and E coli sepsis,
 intubated  // ETT placement? Interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central line terminates in the distal SVC.  The endotracheal tube
 is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  The enteric to terminates in the
 stomach with side port beyond the GE junction.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Retrocardiac opacity has
 worsened consistent with collapse of the left lower lobe and left pleural
 effusion.  Increased opacification of the left upper lobe is likely secondary
 to increased atelectasis.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion.
 2. Increased opacity of the left upper lobe likely secondary to increased
 atelectasis.
