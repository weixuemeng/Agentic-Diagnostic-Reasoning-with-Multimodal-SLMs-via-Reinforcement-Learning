 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity of the left base suggests layering pleural effusion with
 atelectasis of the left base.  There is also bilateral vascular congestion and
 mild pulmonary edema.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette may suggest cardiomegaly or
 pericardial effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Left PICC tip ends in the mid SVC.  Interval removal of Dobhoff
 tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left pleural effusion with left lung base atelectasis.  Mild
 pulmonary edema bilaterally.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette raises question of
 cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.
