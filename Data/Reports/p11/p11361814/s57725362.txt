                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p bilateral sympathectomy ___ for medically refractory
 coronary vasospasm and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia  // Interval
 assesment     Interval assesment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the bilateral chest
 tubes have been removed.  No definite pneumothorax.  Continued low lung
 volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar
 opacifications most likely represent pleural fluid and atelectasis. In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia or aspiration would have
 to be considered.
 Some subcutaneous gas remains adjacent to the lower left chest and a upper
 abdomen on this side.
