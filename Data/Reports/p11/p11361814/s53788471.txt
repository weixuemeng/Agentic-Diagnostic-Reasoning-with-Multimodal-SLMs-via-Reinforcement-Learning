                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p b/l symphathectomy  // eval for post
 operative PTX, drain placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 2 pleural tubes overlying the right and left hemithorax are seen.  No large
 pneumothorax is identified. Subcutaneous gas is noted in the left axilla
 consistent with recent chest tube placement.
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low.  Bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis and
 are likely related to low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are mildly enlarged on this AP projection. Suture anchors are seen projected
 over the left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Mild subcutaneous air seen along the left chest wall
 consistent with recent procedure.  Bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis and
 may be related to low lung volumes.
