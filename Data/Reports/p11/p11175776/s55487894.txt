                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ IPH and now w/ fevers  // ? interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube is in appropriate position. Endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 2.5 cm above the level the carina.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There appears to be mild right infrahilar bronchial
 thickening. Subtle opacity at the medial right lower lung may be due to
 overlap of vascular structures and atelectasis however, developing
 consolidation possibly due to infection or pneumonia and could be present.
 Attention at followup. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the medial right lung base, more conspicuous as compared the
 prior study, may be due to overlap of vascular structures and atelectasis,
 however, underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration could be
 present. Recommend attention at followup.
