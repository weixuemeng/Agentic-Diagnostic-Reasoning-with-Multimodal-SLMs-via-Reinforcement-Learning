                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:35 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, shortness of breath, and vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are still quite low, I am not sure there has been any real change
 in the extent of vascular congestion which is mild in the lungs and
 substantial in the mediastinal veins.  Small region of atelectasis adjacent to
 fissural pleural fluid just above the right hemidiaphragm has been present
 since earlier in the day.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal
 or slightly enlarged, but greatly exaggerated by low lung volumes.
