                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, the patient has taken a much
 poorer inspiration.  Diffuse increased prominence of pulmonary markings most
 likely reflects vascular congestion, though some of this could be a
 manifestation of low lung volumes.  Multiple streaks of atelectasis are seen
 at the bases.  
 
 On the lateral view, there is suggestion of some coalescence of opacification
 in the retrocardiac region.  This could possibly reflect a developing
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
