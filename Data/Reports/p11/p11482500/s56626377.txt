                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and likely within the region of the right ventricle, however
 the inferior aspect of the left hemithorax is not included in the field of
 view.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Small to moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions are demonstrated along with bibasilar airspace opacities
 which could reflect compressive atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot
 be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate -sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy
 opacities, potentially compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
