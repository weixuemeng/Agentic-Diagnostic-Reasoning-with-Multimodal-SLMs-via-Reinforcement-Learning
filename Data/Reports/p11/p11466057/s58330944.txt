                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CAD, PVD. Prominent crackles at bilateral bases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged. Multiple surgical clips are seen projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette. Median sternotomy wires are noted. There is mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema superimposed on reticulonodular diffuse opacities
 which could suggest a chronic lung disease. Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles could relate to small pleural effusions. There is no
 pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and mild to moderate pulmonary edema in the background of
 possible pulmonary fibrosis. Suggest comparison to prior chest imaging,
 particularly any chest CT scans.
