                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF and delirium.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 The right hilum remains prominent with increase in right infrahilar opacity
 which could be due to developing/evolving right lower lobe consolidation from
 infection or aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
