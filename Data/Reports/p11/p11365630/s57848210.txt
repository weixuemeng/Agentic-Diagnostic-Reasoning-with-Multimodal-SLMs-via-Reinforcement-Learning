                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ prominence on left sternum--___
 ___ syndrome  // evaluate ___ prominence on left sternum; evaluate for any
 erosions suggestive of malignacy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  PA Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  , CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unable to assess erosions of the sternum ___ malignancy ___ costochondritis in
 current radiographs.
 
 Patient has multiple chronic pulmonary abnormalities that have since
 progressed.  In the lower lungs, there is interstitial infiltration described
 as mild traction bronchiectasis and cortical reticulation on recent CT in ___.  There also irregular areas of consolidation with bronchiectasis in
 the right upper and left upper lobe which have been noted to evolve from
 interstitial infiltration noted previously on recent CT.   No pleural effusion
 ___ pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.  Calcified aortic knob again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unable to assess erosions of the sternum ___ malignancy ___ costochondritis in
 current radiographs. Consider chest CT for further evaluation.  However, chest
 CT may still be nondiagnostic for costochondritis ___ ___ syndrome.
 
 Multiple areas of pulmonary abnormalities, including areas of interstitial
 infiltration of lower lobes and areas of consolidation and bronchiectasis in
 the upper lobes, have progressed since radiographs from ___.  An
 alternative differential to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, which has
 previously been raised as a possibility, is the possibility of pulmonary
 fibroelastosis.
