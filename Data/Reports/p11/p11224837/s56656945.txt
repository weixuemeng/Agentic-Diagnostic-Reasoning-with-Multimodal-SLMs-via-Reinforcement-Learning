 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain after car accident.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in the

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, and the lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours
 are normal. There are no displaced rib fractures.
