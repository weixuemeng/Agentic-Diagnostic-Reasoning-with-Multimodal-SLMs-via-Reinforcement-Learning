  Increased density overlying the costophrenic angle on the lateral projection
  could represent a small pleural effusion or small focal consolidation in the
  proper clinical setting. Examination is limited due to obscuration of the left
  hemidiaphragm, possibly due to a pericardiac fat pad.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is entirely obscured.  Increased density over the
 costophrenic angles on the lateral projection could represent a small effusion
 or a small focal consolidation in the proper clinical setting.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly is mild and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density overlying the posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral
