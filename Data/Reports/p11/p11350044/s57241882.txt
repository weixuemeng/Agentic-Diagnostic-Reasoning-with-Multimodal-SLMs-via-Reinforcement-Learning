  1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
  
  2. Widened right paratracheal stripe and fullness of the left hilum could
  suggest underlying lymphadenopathy.  Chest CT should be considered for further
  assessment.
  
  3. No displaced rib fractures seen.  If there is continued concern for rib
  fracture, a dedicated rib series can be obtained.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged.  There is widening of the
 right paratracheal stripe.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Fullness of the
 left hilum is demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  A 4 mm nodular opacity in the right upper lobe
 likely reflects a granuloma.  No displaced fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 2. Widened right paratracheal stripe and fullness of the left hilum could
 suggest underlying lymphadenopathy.  Chest CT should be considered for further
 assessment.
 
 3. No displaced rib fractures seen.  If there is continued concern for rib
 fracture, a dedicated rib series can be obtained.
