                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath, asthma. Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  There is no convincing
 evidence for focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  Atelectasis is noted in the left lung base The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and left basilar atelectasis. 
 No definite focal consolidation.
