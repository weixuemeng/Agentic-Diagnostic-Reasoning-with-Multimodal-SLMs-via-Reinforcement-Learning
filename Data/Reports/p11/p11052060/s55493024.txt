 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:00 AM
  Lower lobe opacity best seen on lateral radiograph is most consistent with
  atelectasis however clinical correlation is recommended to assess for
  superimposed infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness, malaise. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. Aorta
 is tortuous and unfolded. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF. No focal consolidation and no effusion. On the lateral view, there is
 equivocal crowding of vessels in the infrahilar region, likely corresponding
 to some patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. No pneumothorax.
 
 Old healed right lateral ___ and 12th ribs fractures noted. At the edge of
 these images, the left AC joint appears disrupted and there is ossification
 along the coracoclavicular ligament, likely sequela of remote trauma.
 
 Clips noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and in the infrahilar region
 on the lateral radiograph is most consistent with atelectasis,  however
 clinical correlation is recommended to assess for superimposed infection.
