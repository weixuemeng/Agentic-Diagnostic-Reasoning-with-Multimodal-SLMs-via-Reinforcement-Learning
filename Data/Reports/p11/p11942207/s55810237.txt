                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever and leukocytosis. 
 Post-operative day 5 from laparotomy converted to open cholecystectomy,
 evaluate for consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 available chest examination ___ ___.  High-positioned diaphragms
 indicate poor inspirational effort probably related to patient's
 post-operative status.  Heart size has not changed significantly and there is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There exist bilateral linear
 appearing densities on the lung bases mostly occupying the posterior depending
 lung segments indicative of poor inspirational mechanics and bilateral
 atelectasis.  There is no significant amount of pleural effusion as the
 posterior pleural sinuses are free on the lateral view.  In the lung mid
 fields and the upper portions, there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrate and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area on
 the frontal view.
 
 When comparison is made with the previous examination of ___, the patient had
 already at that time minor basal atelectasis.  These changes have increased
 dramatically and are most likely the result of poor post-operative breathing
 dynamics.  Parenchymal densities typical for post-operative aspiration
 pneumonias or inflammatory processes cannot be identified on this PA and
 lateral chest examination.
