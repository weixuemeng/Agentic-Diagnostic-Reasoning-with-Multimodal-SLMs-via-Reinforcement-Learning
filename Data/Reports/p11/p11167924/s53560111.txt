                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset PVCs after PICC line placmenet  //
 assess PICC line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left-sided PICC terminates deep in the right atrium and could be retracted
 approximately 5 cm to lie in the distal SVC.  An ET tube is appropriate
 position an enteric tube extends into the stomach.  No pneumothorax
 identified.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Again seen is an opacity in the
 left lower lobe obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border
 consistent with left lower lung collapse.  The opacity at the right base
 medially is more prominent and a pneumonia cannot be excluded in this
 location.  Again seen is the rounded density projecting over the lateral right
 midzone which when compared to the prior exam appears to lie outside of the
 lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left-sided PICC terminates deep in the right atrium and could be retracted
 5 cm to lie in the distal SVC.
 2.  The opacity at the right lung base medially appears more prominent and a
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
