                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia  // ? worsening Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is relatively pronounced cardiomegaly and prominence of the
 pulmonary hila, similar to the prior film.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.  Platelike
 atelectasis again noted in the right mid zone, slightly more extensive.  The
 right costophrenic angle is not well visualized and the possibility of a small
 right pleural effusion, new compared with the prior study, cannot be excluded.
 Left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. Some increased retrocardiac
 opacity is again seen, with minimal atelectasis at the lateral left lung base.
 
 An NG/Oro-gastric type tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film.  Clips noted in the right supraclavicular region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly.  Prominent hila suggestive of chronic pulmonary hypertension.
 These findings are not significantly changed.
 2. Mild vascular plethora, possibly slightly worse, but without other evidence
 of CHF.
 3. Possibility of a new small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
 4. Persistent retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study.
