  terminating in similar position.  There is a left PICC which terminates in the
  right atrium.  Recommend pull back by approximately 4 cm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p bronch  // eval for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ at 15:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube tip lies approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  The left
 subclavian PICC line tip overlies the right atrium and could be retracted by
 approximately 4 cm to lie in the distal SVC.  An enteric type tube is present,
 extent beneath the diaphragm, off the film.
 
 No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 Cardiac silhouette remains slightly enlarged.  Again seen is increased
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The more patchy opacity previously seen at the left base is
 less apparent hand may have resolved.  Patchy opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic region is again noted.  Minimal platelike atelectasis in the
 right mid zone laterally.
 
 Upper zone redistribution.  Slight interval improvement in degree of vascular
 plethora.
 
 A rounded density measuring approximately 13 mm in diameter of the was pre the
 same projecting over the lateral right mid zone overlies the rib cage on the
 current examination and therefore lies outside the long.
 
 Clips noted along the lower right neck/thoracic edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line tip overlying the right atrium.  If clinically
 indicated, retraction by approximately 4 cm could be considered.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film. 
 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region also similar to the prior film.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax would be difficult
 to fully exclude .
 
 Stable cardiomegaly.  Upper zone redistribution, with slight improvement in
 degree of previously seen vascular plethora.
