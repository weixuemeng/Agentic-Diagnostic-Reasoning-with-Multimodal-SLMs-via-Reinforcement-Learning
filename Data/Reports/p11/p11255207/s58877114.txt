                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male pre operative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates biapical ill-defined opacities.
 Calcific density along the lateral right lower hemi thorax and additionally in
 the left hemithorax at the same level likely reflect pleural calcification.
 Prior seventh left rib fracture is noted. Lungs appear hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Biapical opacities for which additional lordotic views are warranted for
 better localization and characterization.
 2.  Calcific densities along the bilateral lower lung zones laterally, most
 compatible with pleural calcifications.
 
 Findings communicated to the house staff NP ___ by Dr. ___ ___
