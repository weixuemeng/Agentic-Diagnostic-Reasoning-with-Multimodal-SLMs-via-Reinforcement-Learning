                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ETT, status post bronchoscopy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the crania is not well defined, but the tip appears
 to lie approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- tip
 extends beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  This likely accounts for prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and upper zone vessels. 
 
 Compared with ___ at 7:14 a.m., the area of opacity in the right upper
 zone, consistent with a large area of atelectasis, has completely resolved. 
 No focal infiltrate, consolidation, significant atelectasis, or effusion is
 identified on the current exam.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of right apical atelectasis.
