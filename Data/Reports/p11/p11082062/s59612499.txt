                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of poorly controlled
 asthma.  Taken multiple controller meds, Advair, Singulair.  States that she
 was taken off them because they do not work, use rescue inhaler/neb p.r.n. 
 Cough, runny nose, sore throat.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings,
 particularly at the lung bases.  Given this, no definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings,
 particularly at the lung bases.  Given this, no acute cardiopulmonary process
 seen.
