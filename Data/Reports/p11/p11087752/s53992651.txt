                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asymptomatic hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Increased reticulation at the lung bases is suggestive of
 mild edema.  Ovoid opacities in bilateral lower lung fields have no lateral
 correlate and likely represent nipple shadow.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar reticulation is most suggestive of mild pulmonary edema
 though chronic interstitial lung disease remains a consideration.
