                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases are most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.
