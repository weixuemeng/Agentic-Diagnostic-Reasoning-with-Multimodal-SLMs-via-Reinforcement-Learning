                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w. stroke, NGT placed  // Please assess NGT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, an NG tube has been placed.  The tip is poorly
 delineated.  I suspect that it overlies the gastric fundus.  If the sideport
 is present is not well seen and cannot be localized.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker type device is again noted, similar in configuration. 
 Is still difficult to trace the thinnest lead is better seen, but still
 difficult 2 trace in its entire T, this may very well be due to technical
 factors.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, with prominence of either the right
 heart border right pulmonary artery, similar to prior.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora, compatible
 with CHF, progressed compared with the prior study.  Minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle again noted.  Equivocal blunting of left costophrenic
 angle.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Incidental note is made a linear of increased density in the upper thoracic
 vertebral body, question L1, with diminished height of the vertebral body. 
 Taken together, the appearance is suggestive of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip difficult to trace, likely over fundus.  An NG tube sideport, if
 present, is not distinctly visible on this film.
 
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with suspected pulmonary artery
 enlargement, similar to the prior study.
 
 Vascular plethora and interstitial edema , consistent with mild CHF, increased
 compared with the prior study.  .
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 
 Minimal blunting of the right and question left costophrenic angles.
