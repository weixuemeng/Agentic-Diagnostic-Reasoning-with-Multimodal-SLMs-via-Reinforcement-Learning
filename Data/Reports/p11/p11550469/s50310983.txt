                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stroke, found down  // assess for infection,
 aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  A left-sided pacemaker type device is
 present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.  Perhaps
 due to positioning or technique, continuity of the right ventricular lead
 cannot be confirmed on these images.
 
 There is probable cardiomegaly, including prominence of the right heart.  Mild
 unfolding of the aorta.  Mild prominence of the vascular markings is noted,
 though this is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation.  No gross effusion.  No
 pneumo thorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Cardiomegaly.
 
 Pacemaker type device present.  Please note that continuity of the right
 ventricular lead cannot be traced on these images, though this could be due to
 technical factors and positioning.  If clinically indicated, a repeat AP view
 centered lower and with increased exposure could help for further assessment.
 
 No overt CHF or frank consolidation.  An early focus of aspiration or
 infectious infiltrate could be obscured due to low lung volumes.
