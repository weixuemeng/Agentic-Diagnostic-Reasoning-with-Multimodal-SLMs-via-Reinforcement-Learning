                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post tracheostomy with dyspnea and
 agitation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is again visualized in good position.  Other
 support devices remain stable.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is perhaps the appearance of decreased opacification of the
 right base and worsening  opacification at the left base; however this is
 likely due to patient positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged chest radiograph.
