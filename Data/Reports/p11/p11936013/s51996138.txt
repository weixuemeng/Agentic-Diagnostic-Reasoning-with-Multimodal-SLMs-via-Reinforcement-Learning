 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Low lung volumes and relatively extensive bilateral pleural effusions
 with areas of atelectasis in both lung bases.  The contours of the cardiac
 silhouette cannot be exactly determined.  The nasogastric tube and the
 tracheostomy tube are unchanged.  Right PICC line is also unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
