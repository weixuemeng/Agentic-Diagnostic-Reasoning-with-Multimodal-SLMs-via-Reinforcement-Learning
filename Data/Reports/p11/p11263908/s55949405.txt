                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The heart aorta has a smooth well-defined
 contour but appears at least mildly tortuous - often due to a history of
 hypertension - and perhaps mildly dilated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. There is slight posterior blunting of costophrenic sulci but any
 substantial pleural effusion is doubtful on and probably there are none.  The
 lungs appear clear.  Surgical clips project along the left axilla.  There is
 volume loss in the left breast compared to the right suggesting prior a
 mastectomy but with increased density so there may be a breast implant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Tortuous aorta and
 possibly ectasia.  In follow-up, if available, correlation with prior
 radiographs is recommended. If radiographic stability of the findings is not
 established, chest CT should be considered to rule out ectasia which may be
 appropriate to follow-up.
