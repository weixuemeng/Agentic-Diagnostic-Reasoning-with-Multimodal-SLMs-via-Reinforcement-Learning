                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, immunocompromised
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest wall port
 with the catheter terminating in the low SVC.  Bilateral surgical clips are
 again noted, reflecting prior breast surgery.  Lung volumes are slightly lower
 compared to prior exam, accentuating cardiac size and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and
 there is no focal consolidation, appreciable pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Slightly low lung volumes.
