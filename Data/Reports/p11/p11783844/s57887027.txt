                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with AMS.  Evaluate ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The ETT tip projects approximately 4 cm from the
 carina with the neck in neutral position.  No pleural effusion, overt edema,
 pneumothorax, or focal pneumonia.  The heart size is probably normal given
 this AP projection.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic mild
 diffuse calcifications.  There appears to be a right distal clavicular
 fracture.  The enteric tube tip and side-port project over the expected region
 of the stomach in the left upper quadrant.  There is mild levoconvex scoliosis
 of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT and enteric tube in standard position.
 2.  Right distal clavicle fracture; correlate with focal exam findings.
