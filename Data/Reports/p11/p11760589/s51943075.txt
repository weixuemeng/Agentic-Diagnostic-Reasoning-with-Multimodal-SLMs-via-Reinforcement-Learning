                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and intermittent hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Aortic CoreValve
 device is again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged, but there is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 Known pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not well assessed on the current
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
