                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.  CTA-Chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar
 atelectasis are chronic.  Linear opacity in the right upper lobe corresponds
 to one seen on prior CTA which could be a scar or very slowly growing
 malignancy of dubious clinical significance in a ___ year old patient.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aortic valve replacement is in stable
 position.  Aside from aortic tortuosity, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  No rib fracture is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. This
 examination is not designed for detection of chest cage trauma which is better
 evaluated with detail views of regions of clinical findings, or Trauma/Torso
 CT scanning, as appropriate.
