                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with worsening dyspnea on exertion, rule out
 pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Pre-op PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since most recent prior radiograph, there has been development of
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased haziness at the left base is
 likely atelectasis.  There is no other focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  
 Additionally, there has been increase in size of the cardiac silhouette which
 may be due to a pericardial effusion.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Osseous
 structures are normal for degenerative changes of the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small new bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Recommend further evaluation with
 echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial effusion
