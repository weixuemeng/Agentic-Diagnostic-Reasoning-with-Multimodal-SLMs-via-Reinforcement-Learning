                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Spontaneous left tension pneumothorax, status post left pigtail to
 waterseal.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 9:23 a.m., I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is a left chest tube, with a tiny left apical pneumothorax, that
 appears unchanged.  Also again seen is relative lucency in the left mid lung,
 with distortion of the vascular markings surrounded, raising the question of
 bullous changes.  As before, there is slight rightwardshift of the cardiac
 silhouette.  The right lung remains grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change.  Suspect distorted parenchymal
 markings, suggestive of possible bullous change.  Alternatively, this could
 represent residua from the prior pneumothorax.
