                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left tension pneumothorax, evaluate for interval change, pigtail
 catheter removed.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 2:30 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the left-sided catheter has been removed.  There
 is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, also slightly improved. 
 No pneumothorax is detected at this time.  Relative lucency in the left
 mid/upper zone is again noted. 
 
 Small irregular area of opacity in the left mid lung immediately inferior to
 the left anterior third rib may represent a focal lung contusion at the site
 of the catheter.  
 
 Thin linear density overlying the left lung laterally -- ?  artifact or
 something outside of patient as this is seen only on the frontal view. 
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  
 
 The right heart remains prominent.  In the absence of significant left-sided
 pneumothorax, the possibility that this represents right heart enlargement and
 not simply rightward shift of the mediastinum should be considered.  Clinical
 correlation requested.
