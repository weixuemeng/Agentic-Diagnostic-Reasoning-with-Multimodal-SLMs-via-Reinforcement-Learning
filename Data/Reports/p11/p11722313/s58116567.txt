                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumothorax status post pigtail placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:   Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable upright frontal image of the chest.  There has been
 interval placement of a left-sided pigtail chest tube.  With partial
 re-expansion of the lung.  Increased opacity in the left lower lung and to a
 lesser extent the left upper lung may represent re-expansion edema.  No
 pleural reflection is clearly seen, suggesting significant re-expansion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Interval placement of left-sided pigtail chest tube with
 significant interval re-expansion of the left lung. Areas of opacity in the
 left lung may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema or atelectasis.
