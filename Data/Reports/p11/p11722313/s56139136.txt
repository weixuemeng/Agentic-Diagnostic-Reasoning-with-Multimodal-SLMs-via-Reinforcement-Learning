 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new chest tube projecting over the left hemithorax. 
 Although there is still a large left-sided pneumothorax, rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures is partly resolved.  There is a coinciding trace
 pleural effusion.  The right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post chest tube placement with reduction in the extent of
 mediastinal shift, but persistent large pneumothorax and mild shift.
