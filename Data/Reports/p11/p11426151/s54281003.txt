                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post thoraci spine surgery with
 subjective fever.  Evaluate for evidence of infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast on ___ and portable chest
 radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.

 underpenetration secondary to the patient's body habitus.  Allowing for these
 limitations:
 
 Metallic hardware from posterior fixation of the thoracic spine is present. 
 The lungs are well expanded, without focal opacities although assessment of
 the left lung is limited.  The cardiac size cannot be evaluated due to
 rotation and AP projection but the patient has known cardiomegaly.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Not significantly
 changed compared with ___.
