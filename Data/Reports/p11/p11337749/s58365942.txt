                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. HRCT ___,
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam.
 Diffuse increased interstitial markings are again noted, compatible with known
 chronic interstitial lung disease, not substantially changed from prior
 accounting for differences in lung inflation.  More focal patchy opacities
 within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  Low lung volumes results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, although an element of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion may be present.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.  Chronic interstitial lung disease
 previously characterized on HRCT from ___ as NSIP.  Possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
