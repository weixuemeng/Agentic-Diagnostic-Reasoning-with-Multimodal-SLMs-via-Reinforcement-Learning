                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A number of calcifications in the
 central mediastinum suggest a calcified lymphadenopathy which can be seen with
 prior granulomatous exposure.  There is a patchy right infrahilar opacity most
 suggestive of atelectasis, present before although similar to perhaps slightly
 increased.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  Small to moderate degenerative changes are noted along the
 mid to lower thoracic spine.  Surgical clips project along the base of the
 neck.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right infrahilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis without
 definite evidence for pneumonia, although follow-up radiographs could be
 considered if clinically appropriate.
