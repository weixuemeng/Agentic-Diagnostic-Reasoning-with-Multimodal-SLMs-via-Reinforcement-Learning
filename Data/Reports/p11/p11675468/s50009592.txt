 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter is been
 removed.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in
 a patient with intact midline sternal wires.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggests some chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no acute pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
