 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of aortic valve replacement, prior MI,
 recent open cholecystectomy with increased productive cough.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung
 volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There has been interval
 increase in the size of the right pleural effusion, which is now small, and
 there is adjacent atelectasis.  There is a tiny left-sided pleural effusion
 with some adjacent atelectasis as well.  
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are overall unchanged.  Again seen is a
 left pectoral pacemaker with leads in the expected location.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Small right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and tiny
 left-sided pleural effusion with some adjacent atelectasis as well.
