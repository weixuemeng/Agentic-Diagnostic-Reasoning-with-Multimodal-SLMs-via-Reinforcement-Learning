                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleural effusion.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.  Correlation is made to scout films from an outside
 CT scan performed earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is complete opacification of
 the left hemithorax likely representing large effusion and underlying
 atelectasis /consolidation.  The right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette cannot be evaluated due to a large left effusion.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemithorax without remote prior to assess
 for interval change.  CT scan suggested for further characterization.
