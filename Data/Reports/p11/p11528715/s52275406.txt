                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness-of-breath with history of chest tube placement.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax, consolidation, atelectasis, and chest tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. There
 is re- demonstration of surgical clips in the bilateral perihilar regions as
 well as within the right lower lung.  If present, a chest tube is not well
 assessed.  A moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. 
 Consolidation at the left lung base is likely related to compressive
 atelectasis, although concomitant infection in this region cannot be excluded.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion, not significantly changed. 
 
 2.  Left lower lung consolidation, likely compressive atelectasis, although
 infection in this area cannot be excluded.  
 
 3.  Unchanged mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
