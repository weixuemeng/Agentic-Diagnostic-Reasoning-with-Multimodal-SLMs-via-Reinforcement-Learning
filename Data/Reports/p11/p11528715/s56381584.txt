                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large left pleural effusion, status post chest tube placement. 
 Rule out pneumothorax and assess tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously large left pleural effusion has significantly
 decreased and is now moderate in size.  The right lung and left upper lung are
 well aerated and clear.  Dense opacity continues to overlie the left lower
 lung representing a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours appear normal.  The left cardiac
 contour remains incompletely evaluated due to overlying opacity.  A left
 pigtail catheter terminates in the inferior hemithorax, and there is no
 evidence of apical pneumothorax.  Surgical clips in the right chest wall may
 be due to prior breast sugery. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left chest tube has resulted in decrease in large pleural
 effusion, now moderate in size.
