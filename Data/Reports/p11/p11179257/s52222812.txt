 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with? hx of pcp pn___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Ill-defined ground-glass opacity
 projects over bilateral upper lungs at the apices, as on prior.  Remainder of
 the lungs appear clear, though hyperinflated.  Left nipple shadow is noted. 
 No pleural fusion, no pneumothorax, no edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Biapical opacities persist and remain concerning for PCP or other atypical
 lung infection.  However, if patient has been treated and opacities are not
 resolving, consider CT to further assess
