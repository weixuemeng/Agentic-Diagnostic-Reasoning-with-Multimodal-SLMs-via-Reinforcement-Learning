                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic shock, recently intubated, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Rotated positioning, low lung volumes.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm, overlying stomach.  Extensive spinal
 hardware noted.
 
 The heart borders are obscured, but the heart is probably not enlarged.  There
 are diffuse opacities throughout both lungs, with denser left retrocardiac
 opacity and obscuration of left-greater-than-right hemidiaphragms. 
 Possibility of small effusions cannot be excluded.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:18 p.m.and allowing for technical differences,
 there has been possible increase in the degree of hazy opacity in the right
 and left mid zones, reflecting worsening CHF. Otherwise, findings are overall
 similar. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube as described.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
 3.  Hazy opacity in both lungs, slightly worse in the midzones, most
 suggestive of worsening CHF.  Possibility of underlying infectious infiltrate
 is difficult to exclude.  
 4.  Possible small bilateral effusions.
