                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with urosepsis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 3.9 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach.  Low lung volumes.
 Costophrenic angles is obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusions.   No
 pneumothorax is present.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema appears minimally progressed since prior, expecially
 in the upper lobes. Left lung base consolidation likely represents
 atelectasis. Spinal fixation hardware is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ pleural exam, there is minimal interval progression
 of moderate pulmonary edema.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions and
 left lung base atelectasis.
