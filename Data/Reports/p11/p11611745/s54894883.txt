 WET READ: ___ ___ ___:___ PM
   Right IJ line is low in the right atrium and should be withdrawn by 2 cm for
  optimal position. ET tube is 6 cm above the carina and can be pushed in by 2
  cm for optimal position. Unchanged opacification of both lung fields could be
  related to ARDS or edema. More confluent left lower lobe opacity likely
  related to atelectasis. NG tube is appropriate. ___ ___ d/w ___ MD

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest, single AP portable view.  Rotated positioning.  Note is made
 of a wet reading provided by radiology resident, Dr. ___.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Left IJ
 central line is present, tip difficult to assess, but likely overlying right
 atrium.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. 
 Bilateral spinal hardware noted.  
 
 There are very low inspiratory volumes, with hazy opacity throughout both
 lungs.  The appearance is grossly unchanged compared with ___ at 3:___
 ___m., but, in this setting, it is difficult to distinguish pulmonary edema,
 pleural fluid, infectious infiltrates, and even ARDS.  Because findings have
 progressed relatively rapidly compared with at ___ at ___:___ ___m., a
 component of CHF should be considered.
