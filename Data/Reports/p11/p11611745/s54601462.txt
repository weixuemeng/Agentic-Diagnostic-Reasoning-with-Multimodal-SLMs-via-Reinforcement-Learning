 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm above the
 carina.  The lung volumes are low, obscuring cardiac borders, although the
 heart is probably normal in size.  There is moderate-to-severe elevation of
 the diaphragm with coinciding dilatation of the viscus in the left upper
 quadrant, probably the splenic flexure of the colon.  A splenic shadow is not
 clearly visualized.  Patchy left basilar opacity may be associated with
 atelectasis, but is not entirely specific or characterized here.  In addition,
 there is mild diffuse interstitial abnormalities suggesting pulmonary edema. 
 The patient has a leftward convex spinal curvature with fixation devices to
 the partly imaged and characterized along the lower thoracic and upper lumbar
 spines.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.  If
 clinically indicated, the tube could be retracted somewhat for more optimal
 positioning.
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, suggestive
 of volume loss.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 4.  Prominent air-filled viscus in the left upper quadrant, suggesting
 moderate distal colonic distension.  Clinical correlation suggested.
