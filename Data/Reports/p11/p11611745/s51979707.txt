                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  Markedly rotated positioning.  Allowing for this,
 pulmonary findings are likely similar to the film obtained on ___ at 20:43
 p.m. with low inspiratory volumes, cardiomegaly, extensive pulmonary edema,
 and layering right-greater-than-left effusions.  The CHF findings appear
 asymmetric, more pronounced in the right lung likely due to patient position. 
 
 
 The carina is not well delineated, but the ET tube position is probably
 unchanged.  The NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film.  The left
 IJ central line is unchanged and lies in the region of the cavoatrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Spinal hardware again noted.
