                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubated, found down.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 23:41.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 study was made available for my interpretation today, ___ at 3:15 p.m. 
 Endotracheal tube is high in position, terminating approximately 8.5 cm above
 the level of the carina, and should be advanced approximately 5 cm.  What
 appears to be a nasogastric tube terminates over the mid chest in the midline,
 presumed in the mid esophagus and is high in position.  The lungs are clear. 
 The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Gaseous distention of the stomach
 is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube high in position, terminating approximately 8.5
 cm above the level of the carina and should be repositioned.  The nasogastric
 tube is also high in position, terminating in the expected location of the mid
 esophagus, as above.  The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___
 on ___ immediately after the study was read, at approximately 3:18 p.m. 
 At that point, the patient had been extubated.
