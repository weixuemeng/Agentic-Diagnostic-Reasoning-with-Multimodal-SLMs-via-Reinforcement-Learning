                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, tachycardia  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Multiple overlying EKG leads limit
 the assessment. The heart is markedly enlarged as on prior. Bilateral
 ground-glass opacities likely reflect pulmonary edema though superimposed
 pneumonia difficult to exclude. No large effusions or pneumothorax seen. Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Difficult to
 exclude a superimposed pneumonia.
