                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malaise and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged.  A dual-lead pacemaker device has
 leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  There is
 mild unfolding and patchy calcification along the aorta.  Although there is a
 mild upper zone redistribution suggested among upper lobe pulmonary vessels,
 suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension, there is no frank evidence for
 congestive heart failure.  No focal opacity is identified.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present along
 the lower thoracic spine.  Two thoracolumbar vertebral bodies show a very mild
 and probably chronic anterior wedging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Marked cardiomegaly.
