                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall yesterday now with hallucinations. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion, edema, or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are mild, unchanged.  The heart size is normal, unchanged.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine
 is overall unchanged.  No evidence of aacute rib fracture on this nondedicated
 exam, but note is made of apparent healed lower rib fractures bilaterally at
 the left tenth and right ninth ribs.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are overall similar.  Degenerative changes of the left AC joint
 are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiothoracic process.
 2.  No evidence of rib fracture on this nondedicated exam.  If clinical
 suspicion persists, consider dedicated rib radiographs.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinical concern is high for rib fracture, dedicated
 rib radiographs with a marking of the areas of focal exam findings is
 recommended.
