                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with cough, fever  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  On the lateral view, there is
 increased opacity projecting over the mid to lower thoracic spine and
 descending thoracic aorta.  This may correspond to increased opacity
 projecting over the right hilar region on the frontal view.  Degree of
 cardiomegaly which is moderate is similar compared to prior.  Median
 sternotomy wires are noted.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in
 the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 Opacity on the lateral view projecting over the spine.   This could be due to
 superimposed structures (spine, aorta) with superimposed edema although
 superimposed consolidation from infection or underlying lesion are also
 possible.  Followup will be necessary after treatment for acute issues to
 ensure resolution.
