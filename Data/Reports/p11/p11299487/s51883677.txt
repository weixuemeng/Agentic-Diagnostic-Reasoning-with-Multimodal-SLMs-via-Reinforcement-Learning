                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly low lung volumes,
 which exaggerates cardiac size and bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for
 this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
