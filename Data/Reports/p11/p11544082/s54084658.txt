                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Emphysema is severe.  Calcific left fibrothorax restricts the
 volume of the left lung and obscures its structure. There may be a nodule in
 the right lung at the level of the anterior right fifth rib. A small pneumonia
 would likely be missed, detectable only by CT scanning. Heart size in normal
 and there is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe emphysema. Restrictive calcific left fibrothorax. Possible
 left lung nodule.  Any small pneumonia unrecognizable.  Chest CT suggested.
