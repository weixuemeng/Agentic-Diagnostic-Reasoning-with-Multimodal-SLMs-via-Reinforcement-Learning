 INDICATION:  Multiple rib fractures, evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  Unchanged evidence of left apical slightly displaced rib fractures
 with accompanying pleural thickening.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion
 with subsequent atelectasis at the left lung base.  The lateral aspect of the
 fractured rib is also accompanied by a slightly increasing amount of pleural
 thickening.
 
 Newly appeared small right pleural effusion.  Overall, there are signs of mild
 fluid overload.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Close radiographic followup should
 be continued.
