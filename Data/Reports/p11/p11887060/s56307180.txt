                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year-old male with a history of asthma, now with cough.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, likely the
 exaggerating effects of low lung volumes.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate subtle calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The
 hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are clear but with slightly decreased
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominence of the
 chest wall about the sternomanubrial/sternoclavicular joints on the lateral
 view is of unclear etiology, possibly calcified costochondral cartilage,
 degenerative change, or a pleural/osseous lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  New indeterminate anterior chest wall lesion; CT may be considered.
