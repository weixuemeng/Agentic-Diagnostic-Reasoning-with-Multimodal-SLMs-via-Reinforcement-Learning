 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with s/p fall with decreased breath sounds,
 here to evaluate for rib fracture or acute pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___. Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of both diaphragms compatible with
 COPD/emphysema.  Bronchiectasis is visible in the right lung base.  A right
 middle lobe opacity is unchanged from prior chest radiographs and CT. 
 Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted.  There is no significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits and unchanged. Right-sided aortic arch is again
 noted. Diffuse calcification of the tracheal tree is noted.  The bones are
 diffusely demineralized.  No displaced rib fractures are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD/ emphysema without acute abnormality.  No displaced rib fractures
 detected.  Known right lower lung nodule better seen on prior CT scan.
