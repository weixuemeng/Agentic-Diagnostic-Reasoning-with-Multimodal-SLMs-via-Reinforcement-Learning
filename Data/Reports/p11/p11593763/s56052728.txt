                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, altered mental status, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low.  In this patient with known interstitial lung disease as seen on
 prior chest CT, there are stable reticular interstitial markings compared with
 prior exams.  No new consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is stable.  Slight
 prominence of the right pulmonary hilus is unchanged from prior CT scan. 
 Hardware is again noted in the right proximal humerus.  No acute bony
 abnormalities are detected.  The known left distal clavicular fracture is only
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable interstitial prominence with low lung volumes, likely
 attributable to underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  Mild stable
 cardiomegaly.  No acute findings.
