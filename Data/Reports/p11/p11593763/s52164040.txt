                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged, and likely
 accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mitral annular calcifications are noted. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mild no frank pulmonary
 edema is seen, there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with
 probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis or chronic changes.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Hardware seen within the right proximal
 humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar
 compared to the prior exam.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis or chronic changes.
