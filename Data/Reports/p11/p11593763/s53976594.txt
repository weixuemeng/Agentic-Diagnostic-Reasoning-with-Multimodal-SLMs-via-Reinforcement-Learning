   Low lung volumes, which limits the exam.  Basilar opacities are likely
  atelectasis, although an early or developing pneumonia cannot be completely
  excluded.  Stable cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis, recently extubated,
 after previous intubation for aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Lung volumes are consistently low and the heart chronically moderately
 enlarged.  Relatively stable interstitial pulmonary abnormality in the left
 mid lung, most prominently could be a chronic infiltrative lung disease. 
 Fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle of the mediastinum could be
 distended azygos vein, related to portal hypertension, or adenopathy.  If
 liver transplant is contemplated, then the patient should have a chest CT scan
 to evaluate these abnormalities.  I see no evidence of pneumonia currently.
