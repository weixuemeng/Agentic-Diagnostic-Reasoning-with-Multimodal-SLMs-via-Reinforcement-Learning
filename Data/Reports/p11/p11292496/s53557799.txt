                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison with
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery is most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 There is new opacity projecting above the right upper lung that might be
 concerning for infectious process.  The rest of the lungs are clear, and there
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Followup of the patient four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
 recommended for documentation of resolution.
