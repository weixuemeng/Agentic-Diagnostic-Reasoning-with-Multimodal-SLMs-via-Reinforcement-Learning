                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hazy opacification of the medial right base which is
 likely atelectasis, but an early consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There
 is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged, and stable from the prior exam.  There is a
 stable small calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with a granuloma in the
 right mid lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable right basilar atelectasis, although an early
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
