                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, cough.
 Fevers, chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified at the aortic
 knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with similar prominence of
 the main pulmonary artery contour suggestive of enlargement.  No pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated.  5 mm rounded opacity projecting over the right upper
 lobe is unchanged, likely a tiny granuloma, unchanged.  Streaky opacity in the
 left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.  Unchanged prominence of
 the main pulmonary artery contour suggestive of enlargement.
