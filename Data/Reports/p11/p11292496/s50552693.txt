                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pressure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, similar to the previous
 study.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacities are seen in both lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  Sclerotic serpiginous lesion within the left proximal humeral
 diaphysis is unchanged, possibly an enchondroma or bone infarct.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis, with possible trace
 left pleural effusion.
