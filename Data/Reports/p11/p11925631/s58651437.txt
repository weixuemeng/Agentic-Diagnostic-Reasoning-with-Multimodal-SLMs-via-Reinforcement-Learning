                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is mild left base atelectasis.  There is
 slight increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally, which may relate to
 low lung volumes and minimal interstitial edema; however, an atypical
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
