                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after sleeve gastrectomy
 and loose productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is unchanged appearance of left lower lung consolidation which
 potentially might reflect not only atelectasis but also infectious process. 
 Right lower lung opacity has slightly increased and might reflect interval
 development of infection.  Right middle lobe atelectasis is present.  There is
 no new pneumothorax.  There is unchanged appearance of the upper mediastinum.
