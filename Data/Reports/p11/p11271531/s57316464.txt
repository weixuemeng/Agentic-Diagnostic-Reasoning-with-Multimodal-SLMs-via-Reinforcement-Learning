                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (PA and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with shortness of breath; evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___.
 CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant overall change in the frontal appearance of the chest on
 radiograph.  Several patchy focal opacities there are most visible in the
 right lung may correspond with focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia
 noted on the prior chest CT.  A large area of focal consolidation in the right
 upper lobe just above the major fissure seen on recent CT is not definitely
 seen on the lateral radiograph view today. Retrocardiac opacity noted on the
 lateral view may correlate with focal consolidation better seen on prior CT.  
 Stable bilateral lower lung volumes.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Stable
 widened mediastinal contours, likely from mediastinal lymphadenopathy as noted
 on recent CT as well as mild prominence of the main pulmonary artery and
 rotation accentuating the tortuous aorta.  Stable bilateral linear platelike
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or significant pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is diffuse bony demineralization.  Incidental left
 shoulder surgical hardware is incompletely visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite interval change since prior radiograph.
