                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sepsis, h/o CHF getting fluid resuscitated, obese  // ?
 signs of fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal image of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___ and ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lung volume is slightly lower than left, similar to prior exam.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Opacity in the left lung base likely
 represents atelectasis, although cannot completely exclude aspiration or
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  Platelike atelectasis in the left
 mid lung is similar prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and the aorta is tortuous,
 similar to prior exam.  Orthopedic hardware is noted in the left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Opacity in the left lung base, likely
 reflecting atelectasis but cannot completely exclude aspiration or pneumonia
 in the proper clinical setting.
