 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with some prominence of interstitial markings that could
 reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.  However, there is mild asymmetry of the opacification at the
 bases, more prominent on the right.  This could represent a developing
