                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, who is
 chronically ill, bedbound, with tachycardia, elevated lactate.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pulmonary source of infection, volume status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest
 radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  There is significant soft tissue attenuation.  Right
 lung volume is slightly less than the left lung with similar mild elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  No definite focal consolidation.  Increased streaky
 opacity of the lung bases is probably atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Linear platelike atelectasis in the left mid lung. 
 Cardiomegaly is overall unchanged.  The thoracic aorta it is tortuous,
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema,
 similar to the prior exam.  The left proximal humeral hardware device,
 incompletely visualized, appears intact and overall similar to the prior
 exams.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal pneumonia or overt pulmonary edema.
 2.  Persistent mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
