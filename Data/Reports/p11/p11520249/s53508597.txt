 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:18 AM
  1. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Infection is difficult
  to exclude.
  
  2. Persistent 19 mm subtle ill-defined nodular opacity in the right lung apex.
  Finding are concerning for a neoplastic process, and further assessment with a
  chest CT is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Aortic knob is densely calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen though assessment for left-sided effusion is somewhat
 limited due to overlying pacemaker generator pack obscuring this region.  And
 ill-defined 19 mm hazy nodular opacity within the right upper lung field is
 unchanged from ___.  Calcified granuloma in the left lung apex is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Infection is difficult
 to exclude.
 
 2. Persistent 19 mm subtle ill-defined nodular opacity in the right lung apex.
 Finding are concerning for a neoplastic process, and further assessment with a
