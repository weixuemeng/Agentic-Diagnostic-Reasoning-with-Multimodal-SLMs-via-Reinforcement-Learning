 accentuating the cardiac silhouette which otherwise appears mildly enlarged. 
 There is a left lower lobe opacity, which may reflect aspiration or pneumonia

 There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. No large pleural effusion
 identified, although limited examination of the left costophrenic angle.

 obliques or a chest CT can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically
 warranted.
