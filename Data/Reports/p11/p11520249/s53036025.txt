                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Peripheral right upper lobe lung nodule has grown compared to the
 prior CT chest of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.  On
 the prior chest radiograph, it measured 1.6 cm in diameter and now measures
 1.9 cm.  As AP technique may magnify the nodule, dedicated chest CT may be
 considered for more accurate assessment of interval growth as well as possible
 development of lymphadenopathy in the right hilum.  Heart remains enlarged. 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vascular structures.  Minor
 bibasilar atelectasis is present.  No definite pleural effusion.  Single-lead
 pacer remains in place, with lead terminating in right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slowly growing peripheral right upper lobe lung nodule is concerning for
 primary lung adenocarcinoma.  Dedicated chest CT may be considered for more
 accurate assessment as well as to evaluate for possible right hilar lymph node
 enlargement warranted clinically.
 2.  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases for pneumonia.  Given
 clinical suspicion for this entity, this could be further evaluated with
 repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level. Dr. ___ was paged
 with these results at 8:15 a.m. on ___, at the time of discovery.
