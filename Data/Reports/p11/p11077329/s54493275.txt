                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nonproductive cough, worse in the supine position; here to
 evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with slight flattening of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms, and attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings within the
 upper lobes compatible with mild emphysema.  The lungs are well aerated
 without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A 7 mm density projecting at the left ___ intercostal space
 is compatible with a nipple, which appears symmetrical.  Mild biapical
 scarring appears symmetrical.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent due to patient rotation
 compared to the prior study but otherwise appears within normal limits.  There
 is dextroconvex scoliosis at the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  Irregularity at
 the right posterior seventh rib is unchanged and likely represents a prior
 fracture.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
