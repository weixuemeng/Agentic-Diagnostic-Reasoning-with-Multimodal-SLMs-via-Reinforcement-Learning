                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  A short interval followup is suggested to determine whether this
 represents re-expansion pulmonary edema (which should rapidly improve) or
 possible superimposed pneumonia.
 
  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on
 ___ at 4:43 PM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated  // fluid, opacity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized.  The endotracheal
 tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  The right IJ central venous
 catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.  The previous large
 right pleural effusion is substantially smaller, and is now trace at best. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Aeration of the right lung has substantially
 improved, but there are new extensive right lung airspace opacities.  Left
 perihilar airspace opacities have increased.  The heart and mediastinum are
 magnified by the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval decrease in right pleural effusion, which is now trace at
 best.
 Re-expansion of the right lung with extensive airspace opacities, which are
 most likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema.
