  1.  Increase in left basilar atelectasis, still mild.
  2. Increased interstitial marking of the lung bases with suggestion of
  bronchial cuffing, which may represent bronchitis.
  3. Tracheal deviation to the left, presumably caused by the enlarged right
  thyroid lobe, as seen on recent chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p renal transplant here with fever, ulcer,
 difficulty swallowing.  // intrathoracic process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___ and CT neck ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left for deviation of the trachea with associated coronal narrowing above the
 level of the thoracic inlet is consistent with known right thyroid
 enlargement.  Cardiomediastinal contours are remarkable for increased
 distension of the azygos vein since ___ radiograph. Linear opacities
 are present in the left mid and lower lung, and bilateral perihilar and
 basilar bronchial wall thickening is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar and basilar bronchial wall thickening, which could be due to
 peribronchial edema or infectious bronchitis.
 
 Tracheal displacement and narrowing due to known enlargement of right thyroid.
