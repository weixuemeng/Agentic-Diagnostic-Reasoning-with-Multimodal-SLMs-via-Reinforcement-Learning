                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with breakthrough seizure.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous CT
 abdomen from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Linear opacities at the left lung base suggest atelectasis.  Slight increased
 focal opacity at the right lung base laterally could potentially also be due
 to atelectasis; however, acute infection is also possible.  Increased density
 at the right cardiophrenic angle is compatible with previously identified
 prominent epicardial fat.  Blunting of the right latter costophrenic angle may
 be due to small effusion or atelectasis in this region.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis; however,
 subtle increased opacity at the right lung base may be due to infection. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
