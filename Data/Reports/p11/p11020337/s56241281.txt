                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP, semi-upright AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  Post-traumatic findings along the left posterolateral chest wall
 including pleural thickening appear unchanged.  Again there is also a mild to
 moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a pleural effusion
 that is probably small to moderate in size on the right and possibly with a
 small pleural effusion on the left.  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests
 atelectasis.  Perihilar fullness and hazy prominent pulmonary vasculature
 suggest mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of congestive heart failure with
 parenchymal changes and suspected pleural effusions.  Streaky left basilar
 opacity is most suggestive of atelectasis.  Similar post-traumatic changes
 along the left chest wall.
