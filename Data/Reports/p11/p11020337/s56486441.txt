                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, status post sliding injury 10 days prior with
 persistent right-sided pain and tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent ___ and CT abdomen, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures are seen.  However, there
 is a right lateral rib fracture with an abrupt discontinuity in the cortex
 without adjacent cortical thickening which may represent an acute or subacute
 fracture.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle may represent pleural
 effusion or scarring.  There has been a mild increase in right lower lung zone
 atelectasis overlying the pericardial fat pad.  There are no focal areas of
 consolidation concerning for infection.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible acute lateral right eighth rib fracture, without
 pneumothorax.  Consider a dedicated rib series in order to better evaluate
 this finding.
 
 These findings were reported to Dr. ___ ___ phone by ___ at 12:12
 p.m.
