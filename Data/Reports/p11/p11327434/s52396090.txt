                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RUE PICC from OSH  // PICC position     
 PICC position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the outside study of ___, the right PICC line again
 extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.  Since this could
 possibly be within the upper right atrium, the catheter could be pulled back
 about 2 cm to ensure that it is in the lower SVC. The cardiac silhouette is at
 the upper limits of normal in size.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels, which could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No acute
 focal pneumonia is appreciated.
 Of incidental note is heterotopic bone formation in the region of the
 coracoclavicular ligament, presumably related to prior trauma.
