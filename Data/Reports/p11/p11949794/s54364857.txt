 Limited evaluation of the right lung for focal opacities given the pleural
 calcifications.  Left lung is well expanded and clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour and hila are unchanged.  Heart size is
 slightly enlarged. No superimposed process.

 acute process.
 
 2. No large pneumonia or pleural effusion.
