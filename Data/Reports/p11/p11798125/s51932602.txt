                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitation, fatigue.  Please evaluate for pneumonia or
 mediastinal or cardiac disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates stable dextroscoliosis with
 apex at the thoracolumbar junction.  The aorta is tortuous.  Otherwise,
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours are unremarkable. Bibasilar increased
 lung markings likely reflect early pulmonary edema. 
  Deformity of right upper ribs and the right glenohumeral joint is unchanged
 compared to ___.  There is a cardiac monitoring device projecting
 over the left heart, possibly a Reveal monitor.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable heart size.  Interstitial edema may indicate early heart
 failure.
