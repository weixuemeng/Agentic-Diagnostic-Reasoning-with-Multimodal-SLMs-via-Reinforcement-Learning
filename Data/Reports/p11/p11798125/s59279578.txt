                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intra-aortic balloon pump and dropping
 hematocrit.  Assess for fluid collection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___; most recent
 from ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position, terminating 2.1 cm from the carina.  However, a right Swan Ganz
 catheter tip is malpositioned, located too far within the right lung
 periphery. Proximal repositioning by at least 4-5 cm is recommended.  An
 intraaortic balloon pump is a little high and could be pulled back ~2 cm.  An
 enteric catheter courses below the diaphragm, although the tip is incompletely
 imaged.  There is complete left lower lobe collapse with an associated
 moderate left effusion.  A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema. 
 Enlargement of cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appears similar to prior
 examination.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned Swan-Ganz catheter.  Proximal repositioning by 4-5 cm is
 recommended.
 2.  Intra-aortic balloon pump may be a little a high and could be pulled back
 ~2 cm.
 3.  Unchanged complete left lower lobe collapse with slightly increased left
 effusion, now moderate.
 4.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results (#1) to ___ (APN
 for cardiothoracic surgery), at 11:02 a.m. on ___ by telephone,
 three minutes after discovery.
