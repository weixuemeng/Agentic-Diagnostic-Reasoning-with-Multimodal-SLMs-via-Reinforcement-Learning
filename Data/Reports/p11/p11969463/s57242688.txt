 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post MVC with partial ejection, evaluate
 for signs of bleeding/hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained.  Trauma
 board partially obscures the view.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.

 above the carina. NG tube is in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 2. ET tube is slightly high in position, consider advancing by 2 cm for
 optimal placement.
 3. Chest radiography is not adequate for evaluation of traumatic injury to the
 chest cage.
