                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Spiculated lesion in the right upper lobe with a fudicial marker is compatible
 with known malignancy.  New ill-defined opacification is seen  primarily
 involving the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe,
 concerning for infection.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Hyperinflation of the
 lungs with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices
 is compatible with emphysema.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, and there is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No acute osseous abnormalities present.  Sclerotic focus
 within the left humeral head is partially imaged and is unchanged, possibly
 reflecting an enchondroma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New ill-defined opacification within the right upper and lower lobes
 concerning for pneumonia.
