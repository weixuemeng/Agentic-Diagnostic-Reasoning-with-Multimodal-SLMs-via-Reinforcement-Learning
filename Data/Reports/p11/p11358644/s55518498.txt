                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Chain suture material along the left
 mediastinum is consistent with prior left lobectomy.  A soft tissue density in
 the right upper lobe with a fiducial marker in place is consistent with known
 malignancy, not definitely changed since the most recent prior chest
 radiograph.  Increased interstitial markings and background emphysematous
 changes are again noted.  There is no new focal consolidation.  Sclerotic
 lesions in the left glenoid and humerus are again seen, not completely
 evaluated on the current study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right upper lobe density,
 grossly unchaged since the prior study.  Other findings as above.
