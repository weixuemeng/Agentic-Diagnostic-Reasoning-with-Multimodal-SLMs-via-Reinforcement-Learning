 CHEST TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  CT-guided biopsy with pneumothorax post-CT .
 
 FINDINGS:  Both right-sided pigtail catheters have been removed.  There
 continues to be a right apical pneumothorax.  There is also increased lucency
 inferiorly, likely representing an inferior component to the pneumothorax with
 increased subcutaneous emphysema.  There is a small left effusion that is
 increased in the interval.  The fiducial placement and right upper lobe mass
 are again seen.
