                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest discomfort, history of breast cancer, lung cancer
 status post left upper lobectomy, with right-sided non-small cell lung cancer,
 status post CyberKnife.  Please evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a
 malignancy again seen within the right upper lobe significantly changed from
 prior exam, containing a fiducial marker.  Underlying emphysema is again
 noted.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of
 pneumonia.  The heart and mediastinal contour is stable.  There is absence of
 the left sixth rib likely related to prior thoracotomy.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially stable mass within the right upper lobe, compatible
 with known malignancy.  No superimposed acute process.
