 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pelvic mass, tachycardia  // eval pulm
 edema      eval pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, with the patient supine there has
 been posterior layering of the substantial right pleural effusion with
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is stable. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevation in pulmonary
 venous pressure.
 Surgical clips are again seen in the left axillary region, soft tissue
 opacification along the left lateral chest wall most likely represents an
 overlying artifact.
