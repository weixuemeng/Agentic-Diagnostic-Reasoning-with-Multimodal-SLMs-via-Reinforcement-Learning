 mild left lung base opacity best seen on the lateral view, which appears
 slightly less conspicuous.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 Persistent mild left lung base opacity is less conspicuous on today's
 examination. These findings could relate to atelectasis, however persistent
 infection cannot be excluded.  Followup is recommended after treatment to
 document resolution.
