                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and cold with green sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is a subtle increased density in the
 posterior lower lung fields on lateral view only without frontal correlate
 which could represent atelectasis or a subtle pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased density in the lower posterior lung field on
 lateral view only, which is likely atelectasis; however, infection is not
 excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.
