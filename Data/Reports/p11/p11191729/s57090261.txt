                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 23:26.  Chest CT ___ obtained at an outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, there is no significant change. 
 The patient is rotated.  Again, there is near-complete opacification of the
 right lung, due to a combination of consolidations and pleural effusion, as
 better evaluated on the concurrent CT of the chest.  There is an opacity at
 the left base, which is more apparent due to rotation, but likely unchanged
 from the prior exam.  The left upper lobe remains well aerated.  An
 endotracheal tube is present approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of
 view.  The right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with the tip near the
 atriocaval junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No significant change in the near-complete opacification of the right lung
 from a combination of pneumonia and pleural effusion.  Stable left basilar
 opacity.
