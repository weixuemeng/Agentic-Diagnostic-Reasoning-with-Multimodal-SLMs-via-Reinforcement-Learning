                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of metastatic breast cancer to lung and
 brain, now with hypoxia.  Assess for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest from the same date
 from an outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 4.6 cm
 above the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.  NG tube terminates in the
 stomach.  There is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, which
 corresponds to areas of consolidations and small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion.  There is relative sparing of the upper lungs.  opacities are also
 noted in the left lower lobe.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Heart size
 is difficult to assess due to adjacent opacities.  Port-A-Cath tip projects
 over proximal right atrium.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left
 axilla and left lateral chest wall.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube is appropriately positioned.
 
 2.  Near-complete opacification of the right lung, corresponding to areas of
 consolidations and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, better seen on CT
 chest of the same date.  Additional opacities in the left lung base.  The
 above findings are compatible with multifocal infection, which are new since
 ___ exam.
