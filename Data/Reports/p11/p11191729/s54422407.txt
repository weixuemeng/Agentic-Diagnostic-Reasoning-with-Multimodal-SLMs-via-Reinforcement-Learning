                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pneumonia.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ at 5:03.  Chest radiograph
 ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an endotracheal tube approximately 4 cm from the carina. 
 An orogastric tube is present with the tip below the left hemidiaphragm with
 the tip out of field-of-view.  A right Port-A-Cath is present with its tip
 near the atriocaval junction.  Again there is near-complete opacification of
 the right lung, not significantly changed from the prior exam.  This is due to
 combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  At the left base, the
 opacity has increased in size, which is most consistent with a worsening
 pneumonia.  The left upper lung zone remains clear.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged, and normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Stable near-complete opacification of the right lung, from a combination
 of pneumonia and pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable position of multiple lines and tubes.
