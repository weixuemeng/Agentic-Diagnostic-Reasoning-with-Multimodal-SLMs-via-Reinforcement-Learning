                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is substantial improvement in the left
 upper lobe pneumonia with almost complete resolution of these findings except
 for minimal lateral still present faint opacity.  Tortuosity of the aorta is
 redemonstrated.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable, and no new lung
 consolidations demonstrated.  Reevaluation of the patient in four weeks for
 documentation of complete resolution is recommended of this most likely
 post-pneumonia scarring.
