                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  Mild
 hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease,
 though there is no acute focal pneumonia.  Some prominence of interstitial
 markings could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung
 disease, or both.
