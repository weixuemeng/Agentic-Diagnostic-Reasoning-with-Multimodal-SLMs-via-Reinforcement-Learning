                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with V-tach and cough; evaluate for pneumonia or
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which may be secondary to positioning, slightly apical
 lordotic angle, and inadequate inspiration. Bilateral mild to moderate
 interstitial edema is probably overall unchanged from the prior exam. Stable
 enlarged heart size. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity is probably from
 atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Increased
 opacity in the right upper lung is probably from atelectasis. Stable
 appearance of the left pectoral three-lead cardiac pacemaker device is again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable interstitial edema and cardiomegaly.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
