                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers, cough  // eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 removed, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is stable in appearance
 and interstitial edema has slightly decreased in severity. Increased opacity
 overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view raises a concern for
 basilar pneumonia, probably in the right lower lobe based on increased opacity
 of the right retrocardiac region on the PA view. Lungs remain hyperinflated,
 consistent with emphysema. .
