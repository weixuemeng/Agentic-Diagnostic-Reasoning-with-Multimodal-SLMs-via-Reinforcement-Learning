                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with long standing congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is
 re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with relative attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards
 the apices compatible with emphysema. Mild pulmonary edema is new compared to
 the prior study with more focal bibasilar airspace opacities potentially
 reflecting atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified, with scarring noted in the lung
 apices. Degenerative changes are noted in both acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval, with patchy bibasilar opacities,
 potentially atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Emphysema.
