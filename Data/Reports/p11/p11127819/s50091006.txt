                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of CHF and COPD, new persistent
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Greater opacification in the right infrahilar
 lung may correspond to a greater radiopacity projecting over the descending
 thoracic aorta in the lowest fully visible vertebral body on the lateral view.
 This could be very early pneumonia or the effects of aspiration.  For
 additional radiographic documentation, recommend oblique views.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion, edema, or pleural effusion.  Hyperinflation and
 vascular deficiency in the upper lungs is an indication of bullous emphysema. 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
