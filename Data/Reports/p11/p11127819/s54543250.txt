                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decompensated heart failure with PA catheter
 // evaluate pulmonar congestion, PA catheter placement      evaluate pulmonar
 congestion, PA catheter placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is still mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, so the residual opacities
 in the right lower lobe could be dependent edema.  Alternatively this could
 represent pneumonia that precipitated the cardiac decompensation and edema
 that has improved since ___. Sequential followup is indicated.
 
 Chronic moderate to severe cardiomegaly may have improved slightly since ___.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Leftward
 displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is due to enlarged head and
 neck vessels or enlargement of the right thyroid lobe.
 
 Swan-Ganz catheter still terminates in the right descending pulmonary artery,
 2-3 cm beyond optimal placement, although not as peripheral as it was on ___.  Transvenous right atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in
 standard placements.  Left internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC. No
 pneumothorax.
