                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post near drowning, requiring reintubation
 for dislodged ET tube.  Evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung
 volumes remain unchanged.  A left subclavian central venous catheter crosses
 midline and its tip terminates in the expected location of the right
 brachiocephalic vein.  An endotracheal tube terminates 1.1 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, its tip is in the
 gastric fundus. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Lungs
 are essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.1 cm above the carina, withdrawal of at
 least 3 cm is recommended for appropriate positioning.
 
 2.  Left subclavian central venous catheter crosses midline and its tip
 terminates in the right brachiocepahlic vein, repositioning is recommended.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 10:48 a.m., at time of discovery.
