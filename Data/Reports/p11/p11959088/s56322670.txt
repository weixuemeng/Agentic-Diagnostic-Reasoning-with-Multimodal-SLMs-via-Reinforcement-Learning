                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, including a somewhat convex appearance of the right
 upper mediastinum, which is most often associated with tortuosity of great
 vessels.  However, it does appear somewhat more prominent than prior
 examination, although this may be partly due to technique.  There is a new
 left basilar opacity obscuring the medial left hemidiaphragm.  This is
 potentially a small focus of bronchopneumonia, but streaky morphology on the
 lateral view could be seen with atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left basilar opacity, pneumonia versus atelectasis.  More
 prominent apparent contour to the right upper mediastinum, probably an
 artifact of AP technique.  However, when clinically appropriate, repeat PA and
 lateral radiographs are suggested, perhaps as follow-up to a vague small left
 lower lobe opacity within eight weeks, to reassess.
