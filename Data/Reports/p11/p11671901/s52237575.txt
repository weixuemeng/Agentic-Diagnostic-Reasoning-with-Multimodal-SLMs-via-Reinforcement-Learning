                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Subsequent CT chest demonstrates that the apparent elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is actually due to a large subpulmonic effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History of ovarian cancer with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 Assessment of the cardiac silhouette size is limited due to obscuration of the
 right heart border by an elevated right hemidiaphragm and right basilar
 opacity.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Linear
 opacities within the left lung base likely reflect atelectasis. Medial right
 basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection or underlying mass
 with cannot be excluded no pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm.
 3. Right medial basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection or
 underlying mass is not excluded. Correlation with prior CT imaging is
 recommended.
 4. Subsegmental left basilar atelectasis.
