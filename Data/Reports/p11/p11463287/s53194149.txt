  No pneumothorax. Confluent opacification of the right perihilar region with
  heterogeneous opacities and volume loss in the right upper lobe. Mild

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post bronchial biopsy in the OR.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There is mediastinal widening.  Enlargement of
 the right hilum and increased density in the right upper lobe with denser
 consolidation in the perihilar region should be compared to prior studies for
 better assessment of these findings.  There appears to be emphysema and mild
 interstitial edema.  The stomach is distended.
