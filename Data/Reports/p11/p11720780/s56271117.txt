 INDICATION:  Existing left PICC.  About to use line for chemotherapy.  Assess
 for positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired.  A right PICC
 ends in the low SVC, not significantly changed compared to the prior

 exchanged in the interim.  There is minimal bilateral lower lung
 atelectasis/scarring.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate positioning of right PICC, ending in the low SVC. No
 acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
