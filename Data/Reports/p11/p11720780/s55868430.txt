                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  B-cell lymphoma.  Evaluate pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a possible small left pleural effusion not significantly
 changed from the prior radiograph and decreased in size since the prior CT. 
 Alternatively, it may represent mild pleural thickening.  There is no right
 pleural effusion.  There is no consolidation, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged.  A
 right PICC terminates in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could
 be due to a small left pleural effusion or mild pleural thickening.
