                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with history of left lower quadrant
 tenderness, diarrhea for a month, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis or
 infection.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is felt to most
 likely be due to overlying soft tissue.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis,
 although consolidation due to infection is not excluded.
