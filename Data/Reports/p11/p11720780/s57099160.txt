                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma, TLS (?), distributive shock, question pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  Technologist's note indicates "the patient just had
 cold pack dressing applied to left shoulder and the nurse did not want to
 remove."  
 
 A cold pack overlies the left upper lung and rib cage/scapula, obscuring
 detail.  Allowing for this, a left IJ central line is present.  Allowing for
 rotation, the tip likely overlies the distal SVC.  No right apical
 pneumothorax identified.  The left lung apex cannot be evaluated.
 
 Compared with ___, there are lower inspiratory volumes.  Of note, however,
 there are new small bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is slight upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and consolidation,
 new compared with ___.  Doubt overt CHF.
