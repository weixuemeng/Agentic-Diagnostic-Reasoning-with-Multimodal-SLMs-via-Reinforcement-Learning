                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma, increasing O2 requirement.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Left IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, and diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting
 CHF.  There are bilateral small to moderate effusions with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 2:00 p.m., the effusions and bibasilar collapse
 and/or consolidation are similar.  Upper zone redistribution is also similar
 and may reflect mild CHF.
