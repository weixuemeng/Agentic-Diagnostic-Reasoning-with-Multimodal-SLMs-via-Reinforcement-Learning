 REASON FOR EXAM:  HCV cirrhosis and portal hypertension, pre-op evaluation for
 liver transplant.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Tiny lung nodules are only seen in concurrent CT.  They are
 below the resolution of a chest x-ray.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
