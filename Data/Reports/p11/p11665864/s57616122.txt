                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION: for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___ acquired
 approximately 24 hours apart.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Given low lung volumes, presence
 of mild pulmonary edema may be exaggerated.  Small right pleural effusion and
 bibasal streak atelectasis is similar. Upper lungs are clear. Hear size is
 normal.  Mild mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature congestion is unchanged
