 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lung volumes are low. Since yestarday, bibasilar
 opacities probably from atelectasis have improved.  The aortic arch and
 descending thoracic aorta is generally large, mildly calcified and unchanged

 lung opacities of concern.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
