                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ileus and distention.  Now with new NG
 tube.  Confirm NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest is poorly positioned and much of
 the right lung is not visualized on this radiograph.  A new enteric tube is
 seen along the expected course of the esophagus and then is not well
 visualized projecting over the mediastinum, however, it appears that the tube
 crosses the spine at the level of the T10 vertebra and projects to the right,
 several centimeters in the expected position of the stomach.  Repeat
 radiographs are recommended to confirm this position.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Position of NG tube is difficult to assess on this suboptimal
 study but it appears to project to the right of the T10 vertebral body in
 expected distal stomach.  Recommend repeat imaging for confirmation of tube
 placement.
