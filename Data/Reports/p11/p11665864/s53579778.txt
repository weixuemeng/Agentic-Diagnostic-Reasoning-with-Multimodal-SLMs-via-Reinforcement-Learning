                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:40 A.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with newly placed NG tube, check position.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 An AP semi-upright portable study centered around the epigastric region dated
 ___ at 4:40 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip likely
 within the proximal duodenum.  The distal end of a right subclavian PICC line
 is seen in the distal SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  There is likely patchy opacity at both bases most
 consistent with bibasilar atelectasis.  Clinical correlation, however, is
 advised.
