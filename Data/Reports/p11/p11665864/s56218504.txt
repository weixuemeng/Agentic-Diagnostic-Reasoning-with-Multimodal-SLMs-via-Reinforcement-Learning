 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with below-knee amputation requiring
 increased oxygen.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes, however, even allowing for this, there are likely
 airspace opacities bilaterally suggestive of either volume overload versus
 multifocal pneumonia.  The vascular pedicle is widened thus pulmonary edema is
 favored.  There is cardiomegaly.
