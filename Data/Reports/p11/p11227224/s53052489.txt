                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with interstitial lung disease, atrial
 fibrillation here with a presumed GI bleed.  // Does this woman have acute
 pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change. Probable background hyperinflation. Mild
 cardiomegaly. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis, but no focal consolidation. No gross effusion. On today's
 examination, the left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.
 
 Incidental note is made of advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis on both sides
 and multiple loose bodies in the left shoulder joint.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change compared with 1 day earlier. Upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence for CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis.
