                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with Afib (on warfarin), COP/ILD, CAD s/p PCI, recent UGIB,
 now p/w c. diff infection, Afib s/p TEE/DCCV, dCHF. with change in mental
 status  // evidence of pneumonia, worsening pleural effusion/pulm edema    
 evidence of pneumonia, worsening pleural effusion/pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  This again suggests
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification is
 consistent with some combination of left effusion and substantial volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.  The right lung remains essentially clear except for
 relatively mild atelectatic changes.
