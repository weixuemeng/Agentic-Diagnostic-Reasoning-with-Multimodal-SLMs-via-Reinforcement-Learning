                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, pneumonia and CHF // ?interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph performed yesterday morning, there is
 interval enlargement of an area of opacification in the right perihilar
 region, which most likely represents worsening pulmonary edema.  However, an
 underlying infection cannot be excluded. A small right pleural effusion is
 noted. There is no pneumothorax.  The heart remains enlarged. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right perihilar opacity most likely represents worsening pulmonary
 edema, though underlying infection cannot be excluded. Recommend follow-up CXR
 after diuresis to differentiate, if clinically appropriate.
