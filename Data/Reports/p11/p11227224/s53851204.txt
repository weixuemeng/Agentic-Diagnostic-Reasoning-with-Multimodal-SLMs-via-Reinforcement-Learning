                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with Afib (on warfarin), COP/ILD, CAD s/p PCI, recent UGIB,
 now p/w c. diff infection, Afib s/p TEE/DCCV, dCHF, UTI. Now with PICC
 displaced again additional 1cm out.  // Please assess PICC position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left PICC line continues to projects over the left brachiocephalic vein. 
 Advancement by 7-8 cm would position its tip at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Right middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  Bilateral lower lobe
 airspace opacities are unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 stable.  Left basilar airspace opacification likely due to atelectasis is also
 stable.  Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PICC line projects over left brachiocephalic vein.  Advancement by 7-8 cm
 would position its tip at the superior cavoatrial junction.
 Stable right middle lobe atelectasis.
 Unchanged left midlung airspace opacity may be due to atelectasis.
 Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
