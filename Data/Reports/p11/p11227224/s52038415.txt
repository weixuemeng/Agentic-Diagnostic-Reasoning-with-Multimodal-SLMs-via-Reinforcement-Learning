                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, hypoxia, recent
 cardioversion. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___, ___, on ___. CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The prior radiographs from ___ showed extensive pulmonary
 pathology. The radiograph on ___ is considered to be the patient's
 baseline appearance. When compared to baseline there are bilateral patchy
 opacities, more prominent in the region of the right cardiophrenic angle, the
 right mid lung and the periphery of the left mid lung suggesting an
 infectious/inflammatory process. There is also bilateral diffuse increased
 interstitial thickening, vascular upper redistribution and hilar
 indistinctness suggesting interstitial pulmonary edema and vascular
 congestion. A small right-sided pleural effusion is present. There is no
 pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings compatible with multifocal pneumonia on the background of
 interstitial pulmonary edema and vascular congestion. Stable moderate
 cardiomegaly.
