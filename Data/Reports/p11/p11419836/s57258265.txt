                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new bilateral lower extremity
 edema.  Evaluate for volume overload, cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Poor inspirational effort with high positioned diaphragm conceal
 portion of cardiac shadow which makes assessment of heart size difficult.  On
 the lateral view in which the inspiration was better, suspicion for
 cardiomegaly cannot be confirmed.  There is no configurational abnormality. 
 The thoracic aorta is of ordinary ___ but slightly elongated.  No local
 contour abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 There are no signs of pleural effusions in either lateral or posterior pleural
 sinuses.  No evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates
 are present.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area on the frontal view. 
 Considering patient's history of bilateral lower extremity edema, it is
 noteworthy that the azygos vein is not distended.  Thus, there is no
 radiographic evidence of right-sided cardiac in-flow impairment.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax are grossly unremarkable.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of significant cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular
 congestion in this patient with history of bilateral lower extremity edema.
