                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 9:59
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post PICC line placement.
 
 No comparison studies.
 
 Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful to detect subtle
 interval change.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 9:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC in satisfactory
 position.  There are post-surgical chain sutures and clips in the right upper
 lung.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities and at the left base, there is
 blunting of the costophrenic angle which most likely reflects patchy
 atelectasis in the setting of an effusion, although aspiration and pneumonia
 could also have this radiographic appearance.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Comparison to prior studies would also be helpful to assess for
 interval change.  The consolidation at the left base obscures the left heart
 border, making evaluation of cardiac size challenging.  Mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  There is calcification of the aorta, consistent
 with atherosclerosis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
