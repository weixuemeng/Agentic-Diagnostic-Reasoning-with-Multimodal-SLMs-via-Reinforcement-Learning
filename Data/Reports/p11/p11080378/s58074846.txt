                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post seizure, now with productive cough
 and crackles on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minimal linear opacity within the left
 base is unchanged and likely related to scarring.  No new confluent
 consolidation is identified to suggest aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema or large effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  An ovoid opacity overlying the left apex
 is likely something outside of the patient.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema
