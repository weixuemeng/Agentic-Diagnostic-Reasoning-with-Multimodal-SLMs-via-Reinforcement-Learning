                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer.  Radiation bronchiectasis.  New shortness of breath
 and severe rhonchi on the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ chest radiograph and
 chest CT:
 
 There has been an increase in the opacification in the right upper lung in the
 region of radiation bronchiectasis.  The chest CT on ___ showed severe
 retention of secretions throughout the right bronchial tree.  There is no
 appreciable atelectasis, but I would be concerned about a developing
 pneumonia.  Lateral view shows a tiny volume of pleural fluid, probably on the
 right, not necessarily of any clinical significance.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 slightly more pronounced today than it was on the previous study.  Rightward
 deviation of the trachea is explained by the moderate enlargement of the left
 thyroid lobe which contains a large nodule or cyst also pointed out in the
 report of the chest CT.
