 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MM and cardiac amyloidosis c/o dyspnea and
 cough  // ?pulm edema vs. pna      ?pulm edema vs. pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 bilateral layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases, more prominent on the right.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits
 of normal in size and there is some continued elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
