                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset Afib  // active pulmonary process
 to cause Afib
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Bilateral apical thickening, right more than
 left, with associated likely fibrotic changes at the right lung apex. In
 addition, the right lower lung shows areas of likely bronchiectasis, better
 visualized on the lateral view.  Overall, the presence of a chronic infectious
 process cannot be excluded and should be confirmed with CT of the thorax.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The report was added to the radiology dashboard.
