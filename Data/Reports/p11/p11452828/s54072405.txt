                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachypnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Calcified
 bilateral hilar mediastinal lymph nodes are re- demonstrated compatible prior
 granulomatous disease.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Bibasilar
 linear and patchy opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Chain sutures
 are noted in the right lung base compatible prior wedge resection.  There is
 marked gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel within the left upper
 quadrant resulting in left diaphragmatic elevation and atelectasis in the left
 lung base no pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities, potentially atelectasis, but aspiration
 or infection cannot be excluded.  Left diaphragmatic elevation due to marked
 gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  Clinical correlation with abdominal examination is recommended, and
 consider further assessment with abdominal radiograph or CT of the abdomen if
 necessary.
