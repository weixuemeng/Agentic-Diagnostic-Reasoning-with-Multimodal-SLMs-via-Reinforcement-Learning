                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the initial study, the Dobbhoff tube coiled on itself so that
 the tip was in the mid portion of the thoracic esophagus.  On the final image,
 the opaque tip is in the mid-to-lower portion of the stomach.  Otherwise,
 little change except for improved inspiration.
