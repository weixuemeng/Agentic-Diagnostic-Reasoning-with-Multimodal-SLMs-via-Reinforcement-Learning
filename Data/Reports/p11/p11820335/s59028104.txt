                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube with pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are two right chest
 tubes in place.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax at this time.  The
 lungs are essentially clear without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Surgical clips are again seen in the left axillary region.  There is less
 dilatation of bowel loops but still small pneumoperitoneum with gas under the
 right hemidiaphragm.
