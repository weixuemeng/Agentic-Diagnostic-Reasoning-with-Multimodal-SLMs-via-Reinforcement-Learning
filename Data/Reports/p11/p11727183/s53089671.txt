                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mild hypoxia, postop day 2 after oral surgery.  Evaluate for
 cause.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The diaphragms are flattened, suggesting a component of emphysema. A vertical
 linear abnormality in the medial right upper lung zone is most consistent with
 bronchiectasis and scarring. Irregular mild linear interstitial opacities in
 the bilateral bases, right more than left, is most consistent with a chronic
 interstitial abnormality.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted, left more than right. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Probable chronic interstitial abnormality in the base, as well as right
 upper lobe bronchiectasis and scarring. If further characterization of these
 abnormalities is needed, a CT of the chest could be obtained.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings in impression item #1 were discussed by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 4:35 PM, 3 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
