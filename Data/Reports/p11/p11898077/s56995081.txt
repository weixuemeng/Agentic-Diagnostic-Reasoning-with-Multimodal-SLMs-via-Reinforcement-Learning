                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the left.  Single-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen with
 lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is stable blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle which may be due to trace pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There are
 degenerative changes at the right shoulder joint.  Amorphous linear
 calcification is again seen in the right shoulder joint which may indicate
 underlying chondrocalcinosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to
 trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  No significant interval
 change.
