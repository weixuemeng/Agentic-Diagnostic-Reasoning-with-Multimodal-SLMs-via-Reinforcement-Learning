 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 lesser inspiratory effort, resulting in overall increase in lung density.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged and normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No focal parenchymal opacities to suggest pneumonia.  Normal
 appearance of the lung vasculature, no indication for pulmonary edema.  Status
 post CABG and valvular replacement.  A right pacemaker is in situ, the leads
 are in expected position.
