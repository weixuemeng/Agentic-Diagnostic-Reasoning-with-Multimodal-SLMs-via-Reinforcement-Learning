                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status and increasing weakness, multiple
 falls.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 prominence of the hila raising concern for vascular engorgement, although
 underlying lymphadenopathy may be present and could be further evaluated for
 on chest CT.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the hila could be due to vascular engorgement,
 although underlying lymphadenopathy not excluded.  Findings could be further
 evaluated on non-urgent chest CT.
