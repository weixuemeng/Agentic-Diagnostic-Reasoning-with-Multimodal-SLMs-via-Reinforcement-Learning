                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // Why is he SOB?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior study of 1 day earlier, lung volumes are slightly
 increased.  Asymmetrical lead distributed perihilar airspace opacities
 predominantly involving the right lung have slightly improved and may reflect
 asymmetrical edema with or without coexisting pneumonia.  Widespread pulmonary
 nodules and masses persist, along with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy,
 consistent with metastatic disease.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 present.
