                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wedge biopsy and chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, following removal of the chest
 tube, there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Again there is an area
 of opacification at the right base medially as well as at the left base. 
 These most likely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
