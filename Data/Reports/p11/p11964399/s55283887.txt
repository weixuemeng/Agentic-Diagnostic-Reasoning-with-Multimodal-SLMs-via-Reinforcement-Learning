                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sarcoma and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is a nodular opacification in the
 retrocardiac region consistent with the lesion seen on CT study of ___. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, so there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
