 INDICATION:  Evacuated subdural hematoma on ___.  Right lower lobe
 aspiration pneumonia suspected on ___.  Evaluation for interval

 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  The right lower lobe consolidation
 has improved in the interim.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is no new

 effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
