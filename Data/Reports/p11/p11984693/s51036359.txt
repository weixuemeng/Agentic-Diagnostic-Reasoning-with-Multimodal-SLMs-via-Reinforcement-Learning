                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with status post chest tube, followup
 film.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single view chest radiograph shows interval increase of left lung
 opacification, likely for increase of pleural effusion.  The left pleural
 drain tip ends medially in the left upper lung and might be intrafissural, its
 function should be checked.  Right lung volumes still low with minimal right
 base atelectasis, but without consolidation.  Heart size appears still mildly
 enlarged,  partially obscured by the left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase of left lung opacification likely for increased
 left pleural effusion.  The pleural drain might be in the left major fissure
 and therefore not working properly.
