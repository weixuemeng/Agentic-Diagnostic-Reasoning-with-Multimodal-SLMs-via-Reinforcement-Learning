                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 A moderate left pleural effusion persists, with a single remaining left
 pleural drain crossing the left chest lateromedially to the apex, after
 removal of a more basal pleural drain.  The remaining tube is sharply
 angulated, probably at the point where it enters the chest and it may not be
 fully patent.  Substantial consolidation at the base of the left lower lobe
 could be atelectasis.  Left upper lung and right lung are clear.  Small right
 pleural effusion is stable.  Heart size top normal, decreased since the
 previous study.  No pneumothorax.
