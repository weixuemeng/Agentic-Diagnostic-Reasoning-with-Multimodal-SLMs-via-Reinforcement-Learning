                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 accumulation of pleural fluid at the left base extending upward along the
 lateral chest wall.  The hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen and there is volume
 loss in the left lower lobe.  No definite acute pneumonia.  Pulmonary
 vascularity appears to be within normal limits.
