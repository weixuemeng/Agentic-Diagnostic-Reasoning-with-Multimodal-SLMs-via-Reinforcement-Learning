                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cancer, tachycardia and recent appendectomy
 now with abdominal pain and left lower chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Low lung volumes are noted. 
 Left chest wall port is seen with catheter tip at the RA/SVC junction.  There
 is a rounded opacity projecting over the right lower lung.  There is some
 adjacent consolidation in the right mid to lower lung as well.  Left lung is
 grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Radiopaque densities projected over left right upper quadrant as well as a
 right upper quadrant surgical clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodular/masslike opacity at the right lung base which may represent a
 combination of mass or consolidation secondary to infection.  Correlation with
 older films would be useful.  Alternatively, CT scan could be performed.
