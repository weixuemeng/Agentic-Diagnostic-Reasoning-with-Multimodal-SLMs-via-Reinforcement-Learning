                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings is unchanged, without overt
 pulmonary edema.  New ill-defined nodular opacities are seen within the right
 lung, the largest measuring 18 mm and located within the right lung base. 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is present.  An electronic device is noted within the left mid anterior wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Multiple nodular opacities within the right lung,
 new from the previous study.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Chest CT is recommended for further assessment.
