                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, admitted for bowel obstruction with
 new hypoxemia, leukocytosis, and fevers concern for aspiration pneumonia with
 component of pulmonary edema  // please assess for development of infiltrate
 concerning for pneumonia and presence of pulmonar edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:51 am
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An NG tube is present. Although the infra diaphragmatic portion of the tube is
 not well seen, it does pass beneath the diaphragm.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and background COPD appear unchanged. There
 is vascular plethora consistent with mild CHF and interstitial edema. A small
 left effusion and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle are similar
 to the prior film. There is patchy opacity at the left base similar to the
 prior film. The possibility of an early infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded, but the appearance is grossly unchanged and no frank consolidation
 is seen. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Prominent right paratracheal
 soft tissues are similar to the prior film.
