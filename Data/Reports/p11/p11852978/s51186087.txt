                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Severe emphysematous changes are most pronounced at the lung
 apices.  Increased interstitial markings at the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis and/or scarring.  There is evidence of hyperinflation. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Several clips are noted within the
 mediastinum.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities, though the bones are
 diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severe emphysema.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and/or scarring.
