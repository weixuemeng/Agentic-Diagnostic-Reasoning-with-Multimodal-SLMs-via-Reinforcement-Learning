                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequently obtained chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded
 with right apical cavity, surrounding scarring and right pleural thickening,
 better assessed on subsequent chest CT, consistent with a now known prior
 history of tuberculosis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with sequelae of prior
 pleural/pulmonary tuberculosis infection in the right lung.
