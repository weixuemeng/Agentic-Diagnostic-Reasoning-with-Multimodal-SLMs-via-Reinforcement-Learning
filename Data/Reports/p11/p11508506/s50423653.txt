                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are mild interstitial
 opacifications in the lower lungs.  The possibility of airway infection or
 atypical pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate setting, although
 chronicity is uncertain.  Bronchovascular structures are prominent at the
 medial right lung base, which may reflect airway inflammation, noting
 peribronchial cuffing and it is difficult to exclude the possibility of early
 bronchopneumonia.
