 without overt pulmonary edema.  Right infrahilar opacity may relate to
 vascular structures although consolidation due to pneumonia or aspiration is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
