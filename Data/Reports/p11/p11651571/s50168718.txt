 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:37 PM
  S/P RUL wedge resection. Opacity in the RUL and rightward deviation of
  trachea, suggests RUL collapse. Additional subsegmental atelectasis in RML,
  left base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. R chest tube tip in the right
  apex. ___ d/w Dr.___ at 6:00 p.m on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:23 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after right upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph on ___:
 
 Rows of surgical ___ denote the wedge resection site in the right upper
 lobe.  Upper mediastinum is shifted to the right, and thus is distorted.  This
 suggests the opacification in the right apex is lobar atelectasis, but I am
 not sure whether it is the upper lobe, more likely, or middle lobe.  There is
 also some component of pleural fluid.  Subsequent chest radiograph available
 at the time of this review shows there was improvement in atelectasis over the
 next five hours.  In the lower lungs are small regions of opacity not present
 preoperatively which are presumably atelectasis, but should be followed to
 exclude the development of pneumonia related to aspiration.  Right apical
 pleural tube in place.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size normal.
