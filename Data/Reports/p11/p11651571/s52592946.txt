                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with epigastric pain, worse with eating, leukocytosis ___,
 multiple cancers recent IR guided biopsy of R lung.  Assess for consolidation.
 Assess for perforated ulcer, gallbladder pathology, colitis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___
 CT interventional procedures ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well inflated. Interval decrease in size of 3 x 2.2 cm (previously
 5.3 x 4.3 cm) right lower lobe peripherally located opacity.  No pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable.  Coarse calcifications of the aortic arch are unchanged. 
 Surgical chain sutures project over the left mid lung and right lung apex.
 
 No free intraperitoneal air.  Visualized osseous structures are notable for
 multilevel degenerative changes of thoracic spine with anterior osteophytes,
 subchondral sclerosis and disc space narrowing.  An anterior compression
 fracture of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Decrease in size of 3 cm right lower lobe peripherally located opacity
 consistent with combination of resolving post procedural hematoma and known
 lung nodule.
 2.  Mild degenerative changes of thoracic spine with stable anterior
 compression fracture of mid thoracic vertebral body.
 3.  No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation for superimposed infection is
 recommended.
