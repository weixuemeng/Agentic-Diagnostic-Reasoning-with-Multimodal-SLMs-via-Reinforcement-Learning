                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleural effusions, question CHF, abdominal
 pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest compared to CT abdomen and pelvis
 performed earlier the same day.  Hazy opacities identified at the lung bases,
 left greater than right.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No large pleural effusion is identified. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, potentially due to
 atelectasis, especially given findings on recent CT scan.  Subtle infection
 cannot be completely excluded.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
