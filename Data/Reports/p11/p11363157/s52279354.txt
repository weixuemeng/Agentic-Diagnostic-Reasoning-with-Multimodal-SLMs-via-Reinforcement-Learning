                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. There is a
 mild interstitial abnormality probably due to vascular congestion.  Streaky
 retrocardiac opacification is not very striking and probably due to minor
 atelectasis. Fissural thickening confirms the impression of mild fluid
 overload. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings doubtful for pneumonia but suggestive of mild vascular congestion.
