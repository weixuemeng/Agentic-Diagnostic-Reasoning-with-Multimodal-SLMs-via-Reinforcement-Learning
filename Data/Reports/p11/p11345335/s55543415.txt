 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube replacement.  Evaluation for nasogastric tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been re-positioned.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  No evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The lung volumes remain low. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
