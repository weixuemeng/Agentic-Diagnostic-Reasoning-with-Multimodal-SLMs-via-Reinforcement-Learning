                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness. Possible
 inflammatory cause such as sarcoidosis.  Evaluate for hilar lymphadenopathy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lung volumes are very
 low and there is resultant crowding of bronchovascular structures, especially
 at the bases.  An apparent more confluent opacity in the posterior basal left
 lower lobe is noted. Both the low lung volumes and AP technique accentuate the
 cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes makes assessment for hilar lymphadenopathy and
 evaluation of an apparent left posterior basilar opacity difficult. When the
 patient's condition permits, PA and lateral radiographs with a deeper
 inspiration are recommended to better assess the hilar structures and to
 re-evalute the posterior basal left lower lobe.
