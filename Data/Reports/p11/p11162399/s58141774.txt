                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Progressive weakness.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Bibasal, retrocardiac opacities are
 unchanged.  Small amount of pleural effusion is suspected.  Overall, the lung
 volumes are similar to the prior study.  Given the questionable assessment
 with chest radiograph, assessment with chest CT might be considered.
