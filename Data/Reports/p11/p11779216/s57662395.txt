                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new onset of CHF.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The AP single chest view demonstrates
 cardiac enlargement of similar magnitude as observed on the previous study. 
 Cardiac configuration and appearance of thoracic aorta unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is still congested, but has undergone significant
 improvement of the previously detectable perivascular haze in the pulmonary
 vasculature.  Also, the previously described mild blunting of the lateral
 pleural sinuses has decreased and almost disappeared completely.  There is no
 evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic appearance.  No
 pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of previously existing significant pulmonary vascular
 congestive pattern two days ago.  Significant cardiac enlargement persists. 
 No new additional inflammatory parenchymal infiltrates can be identified on
 this single view chest examination.
