                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing, prior fever, and persistent cough, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The patient is somewhat obliqued on the
 frontal projection.  However, the heart is normal in size, and there is no
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Suggested area of increased
 opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle could merely reflect obliquity
 of the patient.  Minimal atelectatic changes could be present.
