                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications again noted
 at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Calcified granulomas
 are seen within both upper lobes.  Linear opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes are seen within the upper
 lumbar spine.  Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.
