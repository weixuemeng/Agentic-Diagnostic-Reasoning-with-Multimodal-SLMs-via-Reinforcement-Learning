                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  At approximately 5:38 p.m., Dr. ___ spoke with Dr. ___
 ___, covering for Dr. ___. with regard to Ms. ___.  A
 left-sided midline type catheter has been placed.  This corresponds to the
 thin catheter seen overlying the left axilla. By report, unlike a PICC line, 
 it need not reach the intrathoracic vasculature for clinical use,  In light of
 this, this catheter, overlying the left axilla, is nominal in position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Midline in place, assess placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:46 a.m. chest x-ray.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for technical differences, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, with enlarged right pulmonary artery, is not
 clearly changed, although the pulmonary artery does appear more pronounced on
 the current examination.  
 
 Again seen are extensive increased interstitial markings with slightly more
 confluent opacity at the right upper zone.  No acute pneumothorax or new area
 of consolidation or gross effusion is identified. 
 
 A linear density overlies the left axilla in retrospect, this was also present
 on the prior film.  Clinical correlation to assess whether this represents a
 PICC line that has not reached the central vasculature is requested.  
 
 Right axillary clips, severe glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis and deformity
 of the left proximal humeral head suggestive of an old healed fracture are
 noted.  
 
 The location of the "midline" referred to in the history is somewhat unclear
 and clinical correlation is requested to further assess this.
 
 Lateral view shows severe compression of the mid/lower vertebral body, better
 demonstrated on sagittal reformats of the ___ chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette and right pulmonary artery.  
 
 2) ? PICC line over left axilla -- clinical correlation requested. 
 
 3) Increased interstitial markings, similar to prior, with slightly more
 confluent opacity in the right midzone.
