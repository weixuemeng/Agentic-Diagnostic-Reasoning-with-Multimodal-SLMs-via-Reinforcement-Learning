                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain and previous suggestion of left
 hilar enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild relative enlargement of the left hilus compared to the right is not as
 striking today, though objectively, not appreciably changed.  If there is no
 longer referable symptomatology, I would not pursue any further diagnostic
 imaging.  Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and pleural surfaces are normal.
