                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:22 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Check ET tube position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema continues to worsen.  Chin is elevated, and
 tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 3.4 cm above the carina, just
 above the upper margin of the clavicles.  Patient's positioning for the
 radiograph is kyphotic, and therefore the tube is probably further from the
 carina than it appears.  It should not be withdrawn and its tip position
 should be assessed on subsequent chest radiographs.  Right PIC line ends low
 in the SVC.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
