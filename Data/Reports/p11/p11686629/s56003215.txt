                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:06 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with tracheostomy and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest and an image of the right humerus compared to ___,
 6:31 p.m.:
 
 Short vascular catheter projects over the mid right humerus.  This is far
 shorter than I would expect from a PIC line.  I do not see an embolized
 portion of catheter more distally, but conventional radiographs would be
 necessary for that determination.
 
 Lateral aspect of left lower chest is excluded on the image of the thorax. 
 Remainder of the chest is unremarkable aside from mild vascular congestion and
 borderline cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is present
 along the imaged portions of the pleural surface.
