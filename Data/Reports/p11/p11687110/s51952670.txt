 mediastinal metastasis  // ___ year old man with prostate cancer, new

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are diffuse sclerotic skeletal metastases involving
 the spine and shoulder region.  There may be loss of height of an upper
 thoracic vertebral body.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal
 limits in a patient with aortic valve replacement. No definite vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 No evidence of esophageal dilatation. However, to investigate the mediastinum,
 CT would be much more sensitive.
