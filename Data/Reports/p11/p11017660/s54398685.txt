 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, hypoxia and renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature with trace
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There are increased somewhat nodular opacities
 in the right greater than left lung bases.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion with trace interstitial edema.  Mild
 hyperinflation.
 2.  Right greater than left bibasilar opacities, somewhat reticular nodular in
 nature, could be secondary to aspiration or infection.
