                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman. Recently abnormal chest film and clinical
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Radiographic appearance of the chest has not changed since ___. 
 Lung volumes are low and the right posterior sulcus quite shallow, an
 appearance more suggestive of atelectasis and small effusion than pneumonia. 
 Lungs elsewhere are clear.  The heart is normal size, exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature is unremarkable.
 
 Thoracic spinal osteophyte should not be mistaken for lung nodules projecting
 over the spine on the lateral view.
