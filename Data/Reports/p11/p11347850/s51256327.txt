                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increased cough, pneumonia, seen at outside hospital
 CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.  Also reference is made to outside
 hospital CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is a small right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There are a couple of
 left perihilar nodular opacities which most likely represent vessels on end,
 although this could be confirmed on nonurgent chest CT.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen along the spine including DISH.
