                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, though infection at
 the lung bases is not completely excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
