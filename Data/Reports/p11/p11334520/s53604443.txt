                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever after mastectomy  // eval pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 In the region of the left breast surgical bed, there is a large  fluid
 collection, with air-fluid level likely measuring greater than 6.3 cm in
 diameter.  An overlying iatrogenic disc and drain are present.  A small amount
 of subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the overlying superficial soft tissues
 this obscures portions of the lower left chest.  Clips noted in the left
 axilla.
 
 There is a right-sided indwelling catheter, with tip overlying the distal
 SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unremarkable, partially obscured by the changes in left
 breast surgical head and the the patient's arm by their side.
 There is minimal upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. 
 Doubt focal infiltrate.  No gross effusion.  Minor blunting of the
 costophrenic angles cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Changes overlying the lower left chest at the site of the prior mastectomy,
 with prominent air-fluid level.  Clinical correlation is required for further
 assessment.
 2. Doubt pneumonic infiltrate.
 3. Trace upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Possible minimal
 pleural fluid.
