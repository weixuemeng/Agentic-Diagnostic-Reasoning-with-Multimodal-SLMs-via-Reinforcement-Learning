 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation and new left leg weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable, including borderline
 cardiomegaly.  There are new small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural
 effusions with patchy parenchymal densities and low lung volumes, a setting
 suggestive that opacities are probably due to associated atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small bilateral pleural effusions and associated opacities
 due to probable atelectasis.
