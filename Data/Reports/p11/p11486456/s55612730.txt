                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.No previous ___ chest x-rays on PACS record
 for comparison.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  There is some patchy opacity at the left lung base. 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right base medially, without frank consolidation. 
 Upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity at the left lung base.  The differential diagnosis
 includes changes due to an early pneumonic infiltrate or aspiration
 pneumonitis.  Followup imaging to confirm resolution is strongly recommended.
