                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.    Given differences in technique compared
 to most recent CT scan, there has been no definite change.  Increased
 interstitial markings seen throughout the lungs particularly at the bases left
 greater than right has not definitely changed.  Low lung volumes are again
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process noting that subtle change could
 easily be obscured given background of changes compatible with known pulmonary
 fibrosis.
