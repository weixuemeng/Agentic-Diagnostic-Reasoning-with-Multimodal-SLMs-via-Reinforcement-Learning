 ?pneumonia. confirm L IJ CVL
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso performed immediately after this on ___.

 is top-normal in size.  An endotracheal tube ends 5.1 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses into the stomach, and out of the field of view.  Right
 internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Left
