                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new heart failure and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  // Evaluate interval change in pleural effusions after diuresis   
 Evaluate interval change in pleural effusions after diuresis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Greater opacification in the left mid lung zone is probably due to increasing
 large left pleural effusion.  Conventional radiographs would be helpful in
 distinguishing that from new left lung consolidation.  Left lung remains
 collapse.  Moderate right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis of both
 improved.  The heart is severely enlarged but there is neither mediastinal nor
 pulmonary vascular engorgement and no pulmonary edema.
