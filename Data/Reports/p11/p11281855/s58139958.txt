                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with large pulmonary embolism, on ECMO, with hypoxia. 
 Please evaluate for interval change, OG placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 NG tube can be followed up until mid esophagus, but its distal end is not
 clearly seen in this patient with known hiatal hernia.  Bilateral moderate
 pleural effusions are unchanged with bibasilar atelectasis.  NG tube ends 2.5
 cm above the carina.  There is a new line coming from the abdomen, going to
 mid mediastinum.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 NG tube has been repositioned and its distal end is not definitively seen.  It
 could be followed up until mid mediastinum.
