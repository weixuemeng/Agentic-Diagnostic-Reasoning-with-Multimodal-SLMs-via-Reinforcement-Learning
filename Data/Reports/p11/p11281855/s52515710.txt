                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:57 A.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cardiogenic shock.  Check line placements.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Newly inserted nasogastric tube is looped
 widely in the hypopharynx and ends in a hiatus hernia.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions have increased.  Severe cardiomegaly is stable, but
 mediastinal venous engorgement has progressed.  Constellation of findings
 should raise some concern about pericardial effusion and possible tamponade.
 
 Cannula projecting over the mediastinum and right heart cannot be localized on
 single frontal view.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings at 9:15am.
