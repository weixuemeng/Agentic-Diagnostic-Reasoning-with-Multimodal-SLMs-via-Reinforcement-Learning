  Decreased size of right upper lobe paratracheal opacity after bronchoscopy may
  reflect improving partial lobe collapse.  Unchanged severe pulmonary edema.
  Stable lines and tubes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe abnormalities, evaluation after bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There is unchanged evidence of displaced right-sided
 rib fractures.  The extent of massive pulmonary edema is also unchanged. 
 After bronchoscopy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The pre-existing
 atelectasis of the right upper lobe is substantially decreased, the right
 upper lobe has now near normal lung volumes.  Neither the left nor the right
 costophrenic sinus is included in the image.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
