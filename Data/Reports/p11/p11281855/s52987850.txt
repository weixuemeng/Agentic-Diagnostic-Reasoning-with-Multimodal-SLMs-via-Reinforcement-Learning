                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  AP chest x-ray ___, AP chest x-ray ___, CT chest ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of ARDS, now with new AFib.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large-bore cannula, which projects to the inferior
 cavoatrial junction.  There is also a Swan-Ganz catheter which takes a short
 course through the right ventricle hugging the right ventricular outflow
 tract.  The ET tube is in satisfactory position.  There is a moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion, and a worsening right-sided pleural effusion.  In
 the right upper lobe, there is a new consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia or
 hemorrhage.
 2.  Course of Swan-Ganz catheter hugging the right ventricular outflow tract. 
 If the patient is having SVTs or PVCs, the course of this catheter may be
 contributing.
