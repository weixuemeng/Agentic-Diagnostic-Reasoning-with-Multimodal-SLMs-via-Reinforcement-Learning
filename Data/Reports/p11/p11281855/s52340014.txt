                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with massive PE, status post intubation.
 
 ET tube is in standard position 2 cm above the carina, lies against the right
 tracheal wall.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right main pulmonary artery. 
 In one of the films, there appears be an NG tube in the left main bronchus; in
 the repeat radiograph, there is no NG tube.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Patient has a large hiatal hernia.  Left lower lobe opacities have increased
 from prior study performed a day earlier; this could be due to atelectasis,
 but a complication of a massive PE such as infarct is in the differential. 
 Right lower lobe opacities have also increased.  There are lower lung volumes.
 If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
