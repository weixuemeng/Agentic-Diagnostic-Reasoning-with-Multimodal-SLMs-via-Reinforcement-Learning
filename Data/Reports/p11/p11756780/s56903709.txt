                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the high right atrium versus
 cavoatrial junction. There are low lung volumes due to a sub-optimal
 inspiratory effort; accounting for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  Calcifications are noted in
 the aortic knob.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Subtle opacities at
 the bilateral lung bases likely relates to bibasilar atelectasis.  A
 retrocardiac opacity is compatible with known large hiatus hernia.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There is no  pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The osseous structures are
 again noted to be diffusely sclerotic, compatible with known diffuse
 metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Right Port-A-Cath terminating in the high right atrium versus cavoatrial
 junction.
 3. Diffuse osseous sclerotic metastases.
 4. Large hiatus hernia.
