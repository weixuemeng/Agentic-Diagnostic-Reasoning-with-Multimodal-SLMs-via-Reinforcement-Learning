  1. No obvious evidence of pneumonia however limited evaluation due to
  overlying mixed lytic and sclerotic osseous lesions from known metastatic
  breast cancer obscuring evaluation of lung parenchyma for subtle
  abnormalities.
  2. Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hypotension weakness. Assess for pneumonia or effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest were provided. Lung volumes are markedly low
 limiting assessment. Extensively sclerotic appearance of the bony structures
 compatible with metastatic disease again noted which somewhat limits the
 assessment of the underlying lungs. Allowing for this, no overt signs of
 pneumonia or edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears grossly stable with a top-normal heart size. No definite
 acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse osseous metastatic disease. No overt evidence for pneumonia or edema
 on this limited exam.
