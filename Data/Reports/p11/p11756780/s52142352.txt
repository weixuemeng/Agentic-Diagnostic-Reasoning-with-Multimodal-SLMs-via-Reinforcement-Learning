                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic breast carcinoma, now with
 ?decreased breath sounds on R  // ?R sided pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal semi-erect radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes remain very low with resultant accentuation of
 cardiomediastinal and bronchovascular structures. The right-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the proximal right atrium or cavoatrial junction. There is
 calcification in the aortic knob. There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified on this single semi-erect view. The bones are
 diffusely sclerotic with mixed areas of osteolysis, consistent with known
 metastatic breast cancer. Prominent retrocardiac density is consistent with a
 large hiatal hernia seen on the abdominal CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Very low lung volumes without pleural effusion.
 2. Large hiatal hernia.
 3. Unchanged evidence of diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
