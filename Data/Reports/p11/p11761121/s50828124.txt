 evaluation.  Lungs are low in volume but clear.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 AP technique but likely normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are poorly
 evaluated but grossly unremarkable.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
