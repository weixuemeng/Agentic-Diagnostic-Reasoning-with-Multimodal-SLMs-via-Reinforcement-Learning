                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right PICC placement, evaluate
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line which is seen at least to the level of the
 proximal SVC but the tip of which is obscured by the newly placed right
 internal jugular dual-lumen catheter which has its two tips in the distal SVC
 and proximal right atrium, respectively.  A feeding tube is in place coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished with crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature and patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax
 is diminished given semisupine technique.  Several clips in the right upper
 quadrant may reflect prior cholecystectomy.
