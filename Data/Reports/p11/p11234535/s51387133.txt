                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with end-stage liver disease, confusion and
 hepatic encephalopathy.  Evaluate for evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some vascular crowding.
 However, increased interstitial markings and indistinctness of the hila
 suggests interstitial edema and vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with associated mild interstitial edema and
 vascular congestion.
