 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly, minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The monitoring and support devices are
 constant.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
