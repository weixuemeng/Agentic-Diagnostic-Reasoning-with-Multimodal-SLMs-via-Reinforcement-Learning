                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and desaturation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath is present, tip over distalmost SVC near RA junction.
 Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are somewhat lower.  Again seen is
 moderately severe cardiomegaly.  On the current film, there is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and
 interstitial edema.  There is new patchy retrocardiac opacity, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Possible minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, without gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  New CHF with interstitial edema. 
 New left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
