                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CT/PET study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A confluent area of opacity involving the majority of the left
 upper lobe has substantially progressed since ___ and is
 associated with a mild degree of volume loss.  Additionally, a new confluent
 opacity has developed in the right middle lobe, also associated with some
 volume loss.  Review of the PET-CT of ___, reveals substantial
 narrowing of the left upper lobe bronchus, raising concern that the left upper
 lobe process may be post-obstructive.  In the setting of known hilar
 lymphadenopathy, the right middle lobe process may also be post-obstructive. 
 Cardiac silhouette is stable in size.  Hilar structures are difficult to
 compare to the prior study due to new juxtahilar abnormalities, but there has
 been apparent interval increase in right hilar lymphadenopathy since the prior
 radiograph, likely accompanied by subcarinal lymphadenopathy.  Known left
 prevascular lymphadenopathy is seen to better detail on the prior CT/PET, but
 left internal mammary nodes are evident on the lateral radiograph.
 
 There are no pleural effusions.  Post-vertebroplasty changes are noted in the
 lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe and right middle lobe opacities which may
 represent post-obstructive atelectasis/consolidation in the setting of known
 hilar lymphadenopathy in this patient with lymphoma.  Contrast-enhanced CT may
 be helpful to more fully evaluate the relationship of lymphomatous nodal
 enlargement to bronchial structures.  Findings entered into radiology
 communications dashboard.
