                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lactate of 5.0  // Assess for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is subtle
 left base streaky opacity which may be due to atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle left basilar streaky opacity may be due to atelectasis, however, an
 early infectious process is difficult to entirely excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting. Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views for better evaluation
 when/if patient able.
