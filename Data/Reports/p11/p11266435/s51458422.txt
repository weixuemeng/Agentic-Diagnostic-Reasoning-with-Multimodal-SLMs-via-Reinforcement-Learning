                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma to lateral right eighth and ninth rib.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity and hilar contours are normal. 
 Interstitial opacities are noted at both lung bases, suggestive of a chronic
 changes.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is
 present.  No displaced rib fractures are noted.  There are mild degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No displaced rib fractures noted, though evaluation of the right-sided
 ribs is somewhat limited.  If there is continued clinical concern, a dedicated
 rib series can be obtained.
 2.  Interstitial opacities in the lung bases, suggestive of an underlying
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  This can be further assessed with a chest
 CT.
