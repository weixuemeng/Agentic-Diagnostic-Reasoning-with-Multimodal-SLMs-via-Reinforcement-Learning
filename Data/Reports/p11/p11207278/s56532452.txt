                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 11:12 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 4:18.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at 11:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of patchy
 bibasilar opacities which likely reflect patchy atelectasis.  In addition,
 there is an interstitial process bilaterally, likely reflecting interval
 appearance of mild interstitial edema.  The heart remains enlarged which may
 reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient
 positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Probable small bilateral effusions.
