  Hyperinflated lungs.  Focal opacity at the left lung base laterally on the
  frontal view, potentially pleural-based.  Correlation with older films to
  document stability suggested and if not possible, chest CT is advised for
  further evaluation on a nonurgent basis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with new ataxia  // ?acute abnormality, infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. 
 There is increased opacity projecting over the left lung base laterally with a
 configuration raising the possibility of extrapleural lesion. Lungs are
 otherwise clear without a focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia.  Heart
 size is upper limits of normal.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the
 left upper outer chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Focal opacity at the left lung base laterally on the
 frontal view, potentially pleural-based.  Correlation with older films to
 document stability suggested and if not possible, chest CT is advised for
