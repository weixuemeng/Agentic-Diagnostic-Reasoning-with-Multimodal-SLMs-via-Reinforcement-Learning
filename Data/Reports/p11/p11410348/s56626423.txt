                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with mitral regurgitation and cough, question
 worsening pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small left pleural effusion has increased, previous small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion has decreased.  Consolidation in the right lower lobe
 accompanied by downward displacement of the hilus suggests this is due to
 worsening atelectasis.  On the left, the opacification is more pronounced and
 similarly could be due to persistent atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  The
 upper lungs, however, are clear and there is no pulmonary edema.  A shunt
 catheter traverses the right neck, chest and upper abdomen.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
