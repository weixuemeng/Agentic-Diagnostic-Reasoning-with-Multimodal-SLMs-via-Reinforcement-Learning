 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual lumen AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG.  Coronary artery stenting is also noted.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with a right hilar mass again
 noted.  Continued moderate size right pleural effusion is not changed in the
 interval.  There is patchy right basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Trace left pleural effusion is
 likely present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of right hilar mass.  Moderate right pleural effusion,
 similar to the prior study with right basilar opacity, likely compressive
 atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
