                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, cough, shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  An AICD is
 unchanged with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. 
 Prominent epicardial fat pads likely account for the subtle effacement of the
 right and left heart border anteriorly.  Right hilar prominence is less
 conspicuous than on prior exams.  There is no convincing evidence of
 pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
