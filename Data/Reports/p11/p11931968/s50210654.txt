 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside CT of the chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.

 right mid and lower lung.  Cavitation in the right lung mass is better
 appreciated on recent CT. The lung apices are relatively clear.  The heart is
 normal in size but is shifted to the right secondary to volume loss in the
 right lower lung.  There is no large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pleural effusion and volume loss at the right base
 with mediastinal shift to the right. Cavitation in right lung mass is better
 appreciated on CT.
