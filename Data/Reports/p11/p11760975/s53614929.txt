 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:20 PM
  Dobhoff catheter coiled within the stomach.  Subtle increased density in the
  left lung base - possibly subsegmental atelectasis given the linear morphology
  though pneumonia is also within the differential given the history of fever
  and bacteremia.  No pneumothorax. No congestion, edema or large effusions.
  Cardiomediastinal contours within normal limits.  ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post kidney and pancreas transplant, now with fever and
 positive blood culture, question acute pulmonary process, assess Dobbhoff.  
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 A nasoenteric-type tube is present -- the tip is coiled and overlies the upper
 stomach. Skin ___ overlie the upper mid abdomen.  No free air is
 identified beneath the diaphragms on this upright film. 
 
 There is atelectasis at the left lung base.  No frank consolidation is
 identified. No CHF or gross effusion.  Hazy density about the intrathoracic
 trachea is noted and could relate to a known thyroid goiter -- this appearance
 has been present on multiple prior studies.  
 
 Compared with ___, the radiopaque Dobbhoff type tube is no longer
 visualized.  Left IJ central line has been removed.  Changes at the left base
 are very slightly more pronounced.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasoenteric type-tube overlies stomach and does not advance beyond the
 pylorus.
 2.  Linear, minimally patchy opacity at left lung base likely represents
 atelectasis.  Given the presentation, however, an early pneumonic infiltrate
 would be difficult to exclude.
