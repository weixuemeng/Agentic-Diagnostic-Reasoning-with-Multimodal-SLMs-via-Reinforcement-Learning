                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post kidney and pancreas transplant.  Assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Aside from minimal atelectasis in the left base,
 the lungs are clear.  The cardiac size is normal.  The tip of the ET tube is
 only 1.5 cm above the carina, this is probably okay given the fact that
 patient is with chin down/flexed.  There is no pneumothorax or pleral
 effusion.  The NG tube is malpositioned, coiled in the distal esophagus and
 the tip is in the mid esophagus.  Left IJ catheter tip is in the left
 brachiocephalic vein, unchanged.
