                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes re- demonstrated.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is interval improvement in aeration of the
 right lung base with decreased right lower lobe opacity compatible with
 improving pneumonia.  Left lung is clear.  No new areas of focal consolidation
 are demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe patchy opacity, improved from prior examination, compatible
 with improving pneumonia.  Emphysema.
