                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Motorcycle accident.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Multiple displaced
 left-sided rib fractures are seen, including the posterolateral left fourth
 and fifth ribs.  Rib fractures are better assessed on dedicated rib series or
 CT.  There is a rounded calcification measuring 5.3 x 5.0 cm projecting over
 the posterior left upper quadrant, which is nonspecific but could be within
 the spleen and represent a calcified hematoma or less likely could be within
 the stomach.  Difficult to exclude a nondisplaced fracture of the distal
 clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There are at least two displaced left-sided rib fractures involving the
 posterolateral left fourth and fifth ribs without evidence of a pneumothorax. 
 Difficult to exclude nondisplaced fracture of the distal left clavicle.
 2.  Relatively low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  5.3 x 5.0 cm rounded calcification under the left hemidiaphragm in the
 posterior left upper quadrant is nonspecific, could represent a splenic lesion
 including a calcified hematoma, could be within the stomach, unlikely to be
 vascular.
