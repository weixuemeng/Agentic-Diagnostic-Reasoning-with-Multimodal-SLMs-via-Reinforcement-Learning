                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated CVL  // palcement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal semi-erect view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube approximately terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. NG tube is
 in the stomach.  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip is in the lower
 SVC.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low.  There is
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Basilar opacities may represent atelectasis
 however superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded especially at the right
 base.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Appropriate positioning of endotracheal, nasogastric, and left subclavian
 central venous catheter.
 
 2.  In the setting of low lung volumes bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis however superimposed consolidation especially at the right base
 cannot be excluded.
