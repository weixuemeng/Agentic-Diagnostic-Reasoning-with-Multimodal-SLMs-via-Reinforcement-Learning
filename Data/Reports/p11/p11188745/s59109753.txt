                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
 rate, thyroid cancer, history of carcinoid
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  Bilateral paramediastinal and opacities are compatible with post
 radiation changes.  Mediastinal contour is similar, and known subcarinal mass
 as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better assessed on the previous CT. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky atelectasis is seen in the left lung
 base.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Previously noted left upper lobe
 pulmonary nodule is better demonstrated on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the left lung base.  Otherwise unchanged exam.
