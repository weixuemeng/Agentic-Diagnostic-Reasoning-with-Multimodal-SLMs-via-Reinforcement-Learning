                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates lower lung volumes
 on the current exam.  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may be due
 to secondary atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified noting severe degenerative changes at the left
 shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 Consider repeat two-view chest x-ray with improved aeration for better
 evaluation.
