                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF, influenza.  Evaluate for failure or pneumonia.
 
 CHEST AP:
 
 Cardiac size within normal limits.  Some tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 present.  There is no evidence of failure.  Some atelectasis is present.  The
 left effusion present on the prior chest x-ray of one day earlier has
 decreased.
 
 When compared to the chest x-ray of ___, the perihilar
 structures appear more prominent and this would suggest some failure is likely
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Some evidence of failure, though decrease in size of left
 effusion.
