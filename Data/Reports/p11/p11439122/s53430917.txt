 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with prominence of the right upper mediastinal contour likely due to the
 presence of a known thyroid goiter.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Small left pleural effusion appears slightly improved with mild adjacent
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, right pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly decreased size of small left pleural effusion with adjacent left
 basilar atelectasis.
