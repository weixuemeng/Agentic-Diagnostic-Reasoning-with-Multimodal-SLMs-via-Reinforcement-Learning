                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall with large laceration on the left knee.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is slightly limited due to lordotic positioning.  Accounting for
 this limitation, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within
 normal limits.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted.  Amorphous soft tissue
 calcification adjacent to the left humeral head likely reflects calcific
 tendinopathy.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
