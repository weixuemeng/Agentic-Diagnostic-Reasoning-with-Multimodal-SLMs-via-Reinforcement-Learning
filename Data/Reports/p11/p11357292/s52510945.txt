                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  EGD, aspiration, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT abdomen dated ___.
 
 New right lower lobe opacities are consistent with aspiration.  Increased
 opacities in the left lower lobe could be atelectasis or aspiration.  Cardiac
 size is top normal.  The cardiac border is partially obscured by the right
 lower lobe consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
