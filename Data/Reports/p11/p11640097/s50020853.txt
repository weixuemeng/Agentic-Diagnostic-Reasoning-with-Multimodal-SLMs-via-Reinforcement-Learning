                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an increased opacity
 projecting over the medial right lower lung. Although this could represent
 atelectasis, early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Heart size is normal. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the medial right lower lung could represent
 atelectasis, but an early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
