                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with unprovoked seizure undergoing toxic/metabolic/
 infectious workup, no clear precipitant  // eval ? infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall lung volumes are low, which may accentuate heart size and vasculature,
 which appear increased in size compared with prior, with mild prominence of
 the pulmonary vasculature. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is atelectasis at the lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in size of the heart and mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature may be secondary to overall low lung volumes and technique.  No
 pneumonia.
