                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A right-sided dual-lumen
 central venous catheter tip that terminates in the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged.  Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus is re- demonstrated.
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
 Lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with
 COPD. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted, possibly new in the interval.  No acutely
 displaced fractures are visualized. The osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized with moderate multilevel degenerative changes.
