                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall x2 in two weeks, landed on the left side
 with impact along the dishwasher door and pain with inspiration, assess for
 acute injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Dual-lead pacer
 projects over the left chest wall with lead tips extending to the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Minimal blunting of the
 left CP angle could indicate a tiny effusion or pleural thickening.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No definite focal opacities or signs of CHF.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours appear normal.  No gross osseous injury.  There is a
 vascular stent in the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of acute injury.  Minimal blunting at the left
 CP angle could represent tiny effusion or pleural thickening.  If there is
 strong clinical concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
