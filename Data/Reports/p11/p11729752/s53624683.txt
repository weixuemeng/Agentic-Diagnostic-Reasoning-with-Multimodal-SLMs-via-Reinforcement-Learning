 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia. 
 Subtle right basilar consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  Additional
 focus of infection at the right lung base is not excluded.  Recommend followup
 to resolution.
