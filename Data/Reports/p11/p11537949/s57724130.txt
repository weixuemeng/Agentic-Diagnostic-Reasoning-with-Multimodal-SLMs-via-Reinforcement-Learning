 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with a malfunctioning PICC line.  Possible

 Conventional PA and lateral films show there is no pneumothorax, and small
 bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right are decreasing.  The lungs
 are essentially clear.  Very severe subcutaneous emphysema is improving on the
 left, but still quite voluminous in the right chest wall and neck.  The heart
 is normal size.  PICC line follows the expected course to the upper SVC.
