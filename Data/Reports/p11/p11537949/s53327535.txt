                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:52 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent ERCP and subcutaneous emphysema, now
 intubated.  Check lines and tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is severe in all compartments, above and below the
 diaphragm, including especially pneumoperitoneum, retroperitoneum and
 mediastinum.  It is difficult to determine whether there is pneumothorax, and
 that needs to be monitored.  I would repeat upright chest x-ray in 90 minutes,
 to see if there are any findings to suggest the need for pleural drainage.
 
 Endotracheal tube is at the carina and should be withdrawn 4 cm.  Nasogastric
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 12:00 noon as soon as the findings were recognized.
