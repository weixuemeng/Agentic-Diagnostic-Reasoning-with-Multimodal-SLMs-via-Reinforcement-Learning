                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post ERCP complicated by subcutaneous
 emphysema.  The patient intubated.  Assess endotracheal tube position and
 question pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph submitted with conventional
 and edge enhancement technique.  Marked subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the
 entire imaged area for the base of the neck to the upper abdomen.  Soft tissue
 expansion of the lateral chest from the air laterally.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is separated from the liver by lucency consistent with
 pneumoperitoneum and pneumomediastinum is evident as well.  No definite
 pneumothorax is visible.  The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm
 above the carina.  All lobes are aerated.  Slight elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Nasogastric tube is seen with the tip and side hole both below
 the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema without definite visible pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube appears in
 adequate position.
