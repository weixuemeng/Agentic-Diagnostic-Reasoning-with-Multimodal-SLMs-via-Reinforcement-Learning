 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are stable. Lungs are slightly
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidations demonstrated. Bibasal linear opacities
 appear to be slightly more pronounced than on the prior study and might
 represent either interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis. Correlation with
 chest CT is recommended for precise characterization giving the combination of
 radiological findings and the clinical findings. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. Lumbar spinal hardware is noted.
