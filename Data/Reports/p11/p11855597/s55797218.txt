                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with on eliquis p/w hypoxia, ___% on 12L, ams  //
 pCXR: eval for consolidation head: eval for CHOCTAW: eval for active extra
 into chest wall hematoma, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including most recently ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is diffuse osteopenia.  Multiple chronic posterior left rib fractures
 are seen.  There is no acute fracture.
 
 Right peribronchiolar opacity is unchanged from multiple chest radiographs.
 Mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Tortuosity of the aorta is again seen.  There are
 calcifications along the tracheobronchial tree.  Increased perihilar
 interstitial markings are likely reflective of chronic lung disease and have
 been seen on multiple prior chest radiographs.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of new focal consolidation as compared to chest radiograph ___.  Right perihilar opacity is unchanged from multiple prior chest
 radiographs and is likely due to calcification of the costochondral joint. 
 However in the right clinical scenario, pneumonia in this location cannot be
 ruled out. .
