                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AFib, chest pain, assess for free air or mediastinal
 widening.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph provided.  Multiple overlying
 leads are present which somewhat limit the evaluation.  The heart appears
 mildly enlarged.  Also noted is left basilar opacity which likely in part
 reflects the presence of a left pleural effusion with left lower lobe
 consolidation difficult to exclude.  There is small right pleural effusion
 with right basilar atelectasis.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contour is widened though the aorta appears tortuous.  No
 convincing signs of pneumothorax.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right with bibasilar atelectasis and possible superimposed left basilar
 pneumonia.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views to better assess.
