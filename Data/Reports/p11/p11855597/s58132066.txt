  Multiple left-sided rib fractures involving at least the left third, fourth,
  fifth, seventh, and possibly sixth rib.  Subtle opacity underlying the lateral
  left mid lung could relate to underlying pulmonary contusion. Possible small
  trace pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall  // eval for trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally could
 be due to mild pulmonary edema and/or chronic lung disease.  Left basilar
 opacity could be due to atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.  Tracheobronchial tree calcifications are seen. Subtle opacity
 underlying the left mid lung could relate to underlying pulmonary contusion. 
 There may also be a small left pleural effusion  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic,
 limiting sensitivity for fractures however, there are multiple lateral
 left-sided rib fractures including at least the left third, fourth, fifth,
 seventh, possibly sixth.  There are likely several compression deformities in
 the spine although not well assessed on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures involving at least the left third, fourth,
 fifth, seventh, and possibly sixth rib.  Subtle opacity overlying the lateral
 left mid lung could relate to underlying pulmonary contusion.  Possible small
 left pleural effusion.
