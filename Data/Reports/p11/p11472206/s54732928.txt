                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Unusual air collection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 8:24 p.m. and chest CT
 performed concurrently but reported separately:
 
 This is a very unusual midline gas collection, has no strict correlate on the
 chest CTA, which does however show gaseous distention of the esophagus, which
 is the explanation for the radiographic appearance, unchanged since earlier in
 the evening.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous
 engorgement are unchanged.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
