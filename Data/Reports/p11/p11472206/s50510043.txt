                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The quality of the image is limited due to patient's body habitus. 
 Allowing for these limitations, lung volumes are low, without focal opacities.
 Assessment of the left lung base is limited due to obscuration by severe
 cardiomegaly which is not significantly changed compared with prior exam.
 Mediastinal widening is secondary to mediastinal fat better assessed in prior
 CT.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A linear
 lucency crossing across the soft tissues in the left as well as the left lower
 lung field represents air trapped in a skinfold underneath the breast tissue. 
 Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly, unchanged from prior.  Otherwise, no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
