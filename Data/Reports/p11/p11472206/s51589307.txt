                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  History of anemia and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as well as CT of the abdomen from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  Projecting over the mid chest, and seen only on the frontal view,
 is an irregular air collection projecting below the level of the carina. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild loss in lower vertebral body heights
 appears unchanged.  The bones may be demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Irregular air collection projecting over the central lower
 mediastinum, probably referring to the esophagus; the etiology is uncertain. 
 There are variety of possibilities including esophageal pathology, including
 the possibility of perforation, although dilatation due to dysmotility or
 inflammation of the esophagus may explain the appearance.
