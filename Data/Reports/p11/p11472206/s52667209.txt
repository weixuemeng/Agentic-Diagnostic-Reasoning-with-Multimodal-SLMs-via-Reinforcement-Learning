 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis, normal alignment of
 sternal wires and without evidence of parenchymal opacities, with the
 exception of minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region.  The lateral
 radiograph, however, shows a small dorsal effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema.
