                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Stroke, intubated, check line.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 5 cm above the carina.  The lung volumes are low. 
 There is increased alveolar opacity in the left mid lung, but it is unclear if
 this is due to low lung volumes or an early infiltrate.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to prior.  NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.
