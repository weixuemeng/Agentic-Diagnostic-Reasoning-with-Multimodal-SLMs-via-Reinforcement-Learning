                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right vertebral artery embolic stroke.  Nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:55 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new nasogastric tube.  At the first attempt, the tube was coiled in the
 esophagus.  At the second attempt, after repositioning (see label on the
 film), the tube assumes a correct course and the tip projects over the
 proximal parts of the stomach.  There is no evidence of complications, notably
 no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
