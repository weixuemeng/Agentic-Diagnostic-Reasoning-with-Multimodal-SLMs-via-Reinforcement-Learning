                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pontine infarction.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway.  The enteric
 catheter projects over the stomach.  Since yesterday's exam, the lung volumes
 have decreased, accentuating bibasilar atelectasis and crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  Mild cardiomegaly has also increased.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis is similar.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  A
 small left effusion may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Crowded pulmonary vasculature is a combination of low lung
 volumes and some mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
