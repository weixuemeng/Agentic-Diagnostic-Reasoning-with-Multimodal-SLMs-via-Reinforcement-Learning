                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The chest appears somewhat hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no indication of lymphadenopathy or
 parenchymal interstitial disease that would be likely to reflect sarcoidosis. 
 In the lingula, there is persistent minor opacification, but considerably
 reduced so possibly due to scarring from a prior process.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent lingular opacity, but markedly reduced, so possibly due to
 scarring; although perhaps unlikely recurrent pneumonia at the site is not
 entirely excluded, however.  No radiographic findings particularly suggestive
 of active sarcoid.
