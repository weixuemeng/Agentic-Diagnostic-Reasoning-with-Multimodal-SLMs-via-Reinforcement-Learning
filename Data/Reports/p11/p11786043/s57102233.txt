                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  On the lateral
 view, a subtle nodular opacity projects over the upper anterior mediastinum
 and a of a shadow projects over the upper middle mediastinum and these
 findings have no frontal view correlate.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  A small
 streak of atelectasis is present in the left lung base.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No clear evidence of pneumonia.  Subtle nodular opacity in the anterior
 mediastinum and a ring-shadow projecting over the middle mediastinum on
 lateral view without a frontal correlate.  While these findings may represent
 overlapping shadows, further evaluation with bilateral oblique radiographs is
 recommended.
