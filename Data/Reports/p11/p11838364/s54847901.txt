                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with severe AS, hypertension, cough status post
 bilateral thoracentesis and pericardial effusion on TTE.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are minimally increased from prior study with
 increasing adjacent atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine and kyphosis.
