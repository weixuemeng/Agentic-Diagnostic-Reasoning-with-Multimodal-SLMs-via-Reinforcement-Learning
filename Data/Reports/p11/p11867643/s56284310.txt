                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:34.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 3:54.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 4:34 a.m., is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube with its tip 3.1 cm above the
 carina.  Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with the tip in
 the distal SVC.  There continues to be right lung and left basilar airspace
 opacities which do not appear to be significantly changed since ___ and
 may reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No large effusions are seen.  Interval
 removal of the nasogastric tube.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in positioning and technique.
