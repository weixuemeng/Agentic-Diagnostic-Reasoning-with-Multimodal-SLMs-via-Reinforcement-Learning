                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post intubation after being found down. 
 Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT and radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina in correct
 position.  Right pleural tube is oriented superiorly.  Consolidations and
 patchy opacities in the right lower lung are somewhat decreased from prior
 study, although still could be infectious, however there is progressive right
 upperlobe collapse, new since the CT from yesterday.  Left lung is essentially
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  No overt evidence of the known pneumothorax
 on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: Progressive right upper lobe collapse.
