                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pneumothorax, now with chest tube to
 waterseal.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___ at 4:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 5.4 cm above the carina, similar to prior.  OG tube terminates
 below the diaphragm.  Left pleural tube is in similar position to prior. 
 There has been interval improvement in right upper lung opacity, likely
 representing improved aeration of the right upper lobe with overall improved
 right lung volumes.  Opacity at the bilateral bases, right greater than left,
 may represent asymmetric edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improved aeration of the right upper lobe.  Bibasilar vague opacities, right
 greater than left, is compatible with asymmetric edema.
