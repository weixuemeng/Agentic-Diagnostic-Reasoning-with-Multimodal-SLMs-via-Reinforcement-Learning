 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent surgery, altered mental status with
 fever.  // evaluate for infection      evaluate for infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a persistent left basilar opacity with an associated small pleural
 effusion which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration in the correct
 clinical setting.  Lower lobe atelectasis could also have this appearance. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.  Streaky opacities at the right base in
 the setting of the low lung volumes suggests atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. 
 No pulmonary edema.  Given the low lung volumes, it is difficult to assess the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours for any interval change.
