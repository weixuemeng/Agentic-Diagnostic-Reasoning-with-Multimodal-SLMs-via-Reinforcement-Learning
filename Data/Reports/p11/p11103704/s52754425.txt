                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MM and increased cough, crackles on exam. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating interstitial opacities and the heart size. 
 On the right, there is a pleural effusion with possible focal opacity.  There
 is left lower lobe atelectasis.
 Heart is enlarged, unchanged from prior.  Mediastinal contour appears similar.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right pleural effusion.  Possible right lower lobe pneumonia. After
 conservative treatment for CHF and respiratory therapy, repeat exam with PA
 and lateral views would help clarify presence of right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Borderline congestive heart failure.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  After conservative treatment for CHF and respiratory
 therapy, repeat exam with PA and lateral views would help clarify presence of
 right lower lobe pneumonia.
