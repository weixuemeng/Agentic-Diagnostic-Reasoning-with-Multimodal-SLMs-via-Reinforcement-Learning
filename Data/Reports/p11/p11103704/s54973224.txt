 WET READ: ___ ___ 4:54 PM
  Left lower lobe pneumonia. 8 mm nodule noted on the lateral view which could
  be related to the pneumonia. Follow up chest radiograph in 4 to 6 weeks after
  treatment is recommended to ensure resolution of findings, at which time the
  nodular density can also be reassessed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is an opacity in the left lower
 lobe, most consistent with pneumonia. An 8 mm nodule seen only on the lateral
 view may be related to the pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  8 mm nodule seen only on the lateral
 view may be due to a vessel end-on or a nodular focus of consolidation.
 However, follow up chest radiograph in 4 to 6 weeks after treatment is
 recommended to ensure resolution of the findings.
