                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered MS  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, aeration of the left lower lobe has improved with
 persistent but decreased size of the left pleural effusion, best appreciated
 on lateral view.  .  Is minimal residual atelectasis remaining in the left
 lower with lung volumes overall slightly improved in the interim.  Residual
 mild retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis.  No significant right pleural
 effusion.  No focal consolidation to suggest focal pneumonia.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is perhaps mild central pulmonary vascular congestion but
 no edema.  Heart size is top normal.  The descending thoracic aorta slightly
 tortuous or ectatic, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis, decreased since the prior
 exam.
 2.  No focal pneumonia.
