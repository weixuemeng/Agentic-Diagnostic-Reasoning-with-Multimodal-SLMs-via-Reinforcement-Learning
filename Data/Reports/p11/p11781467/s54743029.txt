                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with shortness of breath at outside
 hospital improved with Lasix for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON: ___ chest radiographs performed ___ and outside
 hospital chest radiograph from the same day at 12:39 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to chest radiograph earlier today, bibasilar
 consolidation persists, more likely pneumonia than dependent pulmonary edema
 because pulmonary and mediastinal vessels are not engorged.  Median sternotomy
 wires are well aligned. Left pleural scarring and mid lung atelectasis are
 unchanged over at least three weeks, and may be post surgical.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable .  Healed right posterolateral rib fractures are
 longstanding..
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pneumonia
