                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are areas of mid to lower lung atelectasis without definite
 focal consolidation.  Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles may be due to
 trace pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  There may be mild central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is mild anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body
 which on subsequent CT was found to be related to a Schmorl's node.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace bilateral pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening. 
 Scattered areas of atelectasis/scarring bilaterally without definite focal
 consolidation.  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
