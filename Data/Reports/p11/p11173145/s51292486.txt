                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ from___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuates bronchovascular markings.  There is blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic angles, suggestive of small pleural effusions.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  Likely mitral annular calcifications are noted.  The
 mediastinum appears widened, which may be due to perihilar vascular
 congestion.  Levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine is noted.  Partially imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes of the left shoulder are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
