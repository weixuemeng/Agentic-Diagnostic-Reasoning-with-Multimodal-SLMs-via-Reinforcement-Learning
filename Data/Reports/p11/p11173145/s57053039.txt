                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cholangitis and hypotension, to assess for edema or infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Low lung volumes may account for some of the enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Again there is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion
 with small bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectatic changes.
