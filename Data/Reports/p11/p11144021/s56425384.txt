                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Exercise intolerance.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are surgical clips at the
 cardioesophageal junction with opacification along the right lateral chest
 wall.  This appearance is consistent with a pull-through procedure for
 esophagectomy.  Post-surgical changes are also seen in the adjacent right
 ribs.
 
 There is hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting chronic pulmonary disease. 
 However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
