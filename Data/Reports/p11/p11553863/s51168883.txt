                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, recent dx of pna  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Again seen are increased interstitial markings
 within the right lung, consistent with an interstitial pneumonia, improved
 compared to the prior exam.  Paucity of lung markings of the lung apices is
 consistent with emphysema. Cuffed dilated airways in the upper lobes
 bilaterally, more so on the right, are consistent with bronchiectasis.  The
 upper abdomen is unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic lung disease. Slightly increased interstitial markings seen on the
 recent prior are not as well appreciated on the current examination.
