                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough and malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. Irregularity and attenuation of lung markings in the upper
 lungs is consistent with a emphysema.  There are also cuffed dilated airways
 in each upper lung, more so on the right than left.  Although vague there is
 widespread increased density in the right mid to upper lung compared to the
 left suggesting pneumonia with an predominantly interstitial pattern.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting pneumonia superimposed on chronic lung disease suspected
 to include both emphysema and bronchiectasis.
