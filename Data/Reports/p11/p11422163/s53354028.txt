  Low lung volumes exaggerate the central pulmonary vasculature.  In addition,
  there is likely a mild to moderate degree of pulmonary edema.  Left-sided,
  asymmetric, septal lines are now visible.  There is no definite infection, but
  a repeat film should be taken after diuresis, preferably with a better
  inspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent STEMI and low left VEF, persistent dyspnea.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is accentuated by
 the low lung volumes.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema is stable.  Bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side, are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left effusion.
