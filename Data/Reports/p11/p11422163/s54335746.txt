                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Night sweats.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Multiple old healed rib fractures
 are seen bilaterally.  Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of
 the heart, but there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 Streaks of atelectasis or fibrosis are seen on the lateral view.
