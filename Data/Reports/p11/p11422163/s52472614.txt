                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ongoing chest pain after MI.  Is there
 pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The lung volumes are lower, reflecting responsible for basal atelectasis and
 vascular crowding, but I do not think pulmonary edema is present.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is essentially unchanged.  Left bilateral posterior rib fractures
 are chronic.  No pneumothorax.
