                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting after motor vehicle collision,
 evaluate for acute injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  The hila
 are unremarkable.  Lower lung opacification seen only on lateral view is
 favored to represent atelectasis in the setting of a suboptimal inspiratory
 effort.  There is no correlate on frontal view with a better inspiration. 
 There is no pulmonary venous congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of a displaced rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lobe opacity on lateral view is favored represent atelectasis in the
 setting of a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 No displaced rib fracture identified.
