                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pain after fall and syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is coarsened appearance of lung
 markings bilaterally with cuffed airways, probably due to airway inflammation
 and likely chronic, but there is no focal opacification aside from streaky
 lingular opacity which suggests minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild superior endplate compression deformity of
 mid-to-upper thoracic vertebral body is likely chronic.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of recent injury or acute cardiopulmonary process.
