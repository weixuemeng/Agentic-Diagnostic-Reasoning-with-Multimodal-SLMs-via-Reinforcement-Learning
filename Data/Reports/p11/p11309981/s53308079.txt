 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  chest pain after striking sternal area against table.
 
 COMPARISON:  There is no comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Normal lung volumes.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  Normal
 appearance of the lung parenchyma.  No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  On the lateral view, the sternum appears normal without
 evidence of fracture.  However, the chest film is insensitive to detect
 sternal lesions.  If clinical symptoms persist, then CT should be performed.
