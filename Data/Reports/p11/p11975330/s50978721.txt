                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hemoptysis and history of right
 upper lobectomy for cancer ___ years ago.  Evaluate for cancer recurrence.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 available chest examination of ___.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is a prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left
 and posteriorly, but there is no evidence of marked left atrial enlargement. 
 The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and shows calcium deposits in the wall at
 the level of the arch.  There is no local contour abnormality of the thoracic
 aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is a moderately
 elevated right-sided diaphragm, a finding which coincides with a deformity of
 the third and fourth rib posteriorly suggesting an old right-sided
 thoracotomy.  As this also coincides with a mild elevation of the right-sided
 hilar structures, these findings are compatible with a previously performed
 right upper lobectomy as indicated in the requisition.  There is no evidence
 of new acute pulmonary infiltrates on either side nor is there evidence of
 pleural effusion in the lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  No other
 significant skeletal abnormalities within the thorax area as the previously
 described rib deformities.
 
 Mild cardiac enlargement mostly involving the left ventricle in this elderly
 female patient, but no signs of acute pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Described changes in right hemithorax compatible with right upper lobectomy. 
 No evidence of reoccurrence of pulmonary malignancy or signs of metastases.
