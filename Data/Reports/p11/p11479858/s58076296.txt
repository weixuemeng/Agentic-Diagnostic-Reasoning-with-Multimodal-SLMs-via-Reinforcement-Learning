                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place as well as the right PICC line catheter.  Lung
 volumes remain very low with bibasal atelectasis.  There is slight interval
 progression of the right lower lung atelectasis medially that might
 potentially reflect recent aspiration and be attributed to patient's shortness
 of breath.  Alternatively, slightly lower than before lung volumes may
 contribute to this appearance through atelectasis.
