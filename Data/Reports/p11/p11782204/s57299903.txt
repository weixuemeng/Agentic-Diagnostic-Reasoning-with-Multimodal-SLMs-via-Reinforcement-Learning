                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent widening of cardiomediastinal contours accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening pulmonary edema as well as
 apparent enlarging moderate right and small left pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 lung opacities probably reflect atelectasis, but co-existing infection is
 difficult to exclude, particularly in right lower lobe.  Followup radiographs
 after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
