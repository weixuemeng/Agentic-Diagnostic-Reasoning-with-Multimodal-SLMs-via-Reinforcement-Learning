                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with dyspnea, hypoxia  // Acute cardiopulmonary disease, history of
 metastatic lung cancer..
 
 COMPARISON:  T-spine CT ___
 TECHNIQUE   Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive opacification involving the right hemithorax new from
 ___. Opacification involving the left upper lung is similar in
 appearance to ___.  Left basilar opacity is also noted and likely
 represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Opacity in the left
 medial mid lung may correspond to a large bony metastasis seen on prior
 thoracic spine CT. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax. Spinal
 fusion hardware is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large opacification involving the right hemithorax, new from prior as well as
 persistent left upper lung opacification could represent infection or spread
 of metastatic disease, edema is less likely given asymmetry.
