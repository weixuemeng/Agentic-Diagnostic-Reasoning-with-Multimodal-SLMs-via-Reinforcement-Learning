                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Hemoptysis and acute hypoxia  // acute
 decompensation, looking for any new pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The mass in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe is again visualized but
 appears increased in size compared to prior imaging which may represent
 progression in the size of the mass or adjacent postobstructive pneumopathy. 
 There is interval increase in ground-glass airspace opacification in the right
 middle and lower lung zones as well as in the left upper and lower lung zones.
 Associated small pleural effusions bilateral (new on the left).  Expansile
 bony lesions involving the anterior aspect of the left first rib and posterior
 aspect of the left sixth rib is unchanged.  Heart size is unchanged. 
 Cervicothoracic spinal stabilization device in situ.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval progression of the mass in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe
 as described above.  Multi focal ground-glass airspace opacification
 suggesting multi lobar pneumonia or in the setting of hemoptysis may represent
 pulmonary hemorrhage.
