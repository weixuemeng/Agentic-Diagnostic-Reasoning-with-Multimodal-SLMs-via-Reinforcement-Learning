                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old postop fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest dated ___, 11:25 were obtained.  As
 the patient is mentally disabled and confused, he was unable to hold his arms
 up for the lateral image, which does limit the utility of this view.  There is
 also overlying motion on the lateral projection which limits evaluation as
 well.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Given differences in positioning and technique between studies, overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There has been interval
 extubation.  Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized lower cervical
 spine.  Overall, low lung volumes with no focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  Probable small right pleural effusion and stable patchy
 opacity at the right base most likely reflecting patchy atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
