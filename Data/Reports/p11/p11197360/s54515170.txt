                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman treated for pneumonia three to five weeks
 ago, now with recurrent pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an unchanged large area of consolidation and opacity in
 the right middle lobe, which marginates the superior aspect of the minor
 fissure.  Moreover, there is a persistent opacity also in the left upper lobe.
 Allowing for differences in technique, there has been no appreciable change in
 these areas of consolidation.  Would recommend followup to resolution of these
 opacities to exclude underlying endobronchial lesions.  Given the patient's
 young age and poor response to treatment, a CT scan of the chest could be
 considered.
