 from the hilum may represent a dilated bronchus with mucoid impaction.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Heart size is within normal limits.  The pulmonary arteries are
 borderline enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left lower lobe mucoid impaction.
 
 2. Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
