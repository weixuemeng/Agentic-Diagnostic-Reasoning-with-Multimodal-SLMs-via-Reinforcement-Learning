                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Emesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Moderate unfolding is noted along
 the thoracic aorta, as before.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Similar to the prior examination, there are patchy
 opacities in each lower lung, more extensive on the right than left, probably
 due to patchy atelectasis or scarring.  Aeration is somewhat improved on each
 side.  Subpleural scarring is unchanged at each lung apex.  A Bochdalek hernia
 on the left is unchanged in contour.  Mild degenerative changes are similar
 along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration at the lung bases, but with persistent patchy
 opacification, particularly at the right lung base.
