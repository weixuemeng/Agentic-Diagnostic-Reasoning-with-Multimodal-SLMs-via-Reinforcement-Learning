                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtly increased density at the lung bases bilaterally on frontal view only
 likely represents atelectasis or early edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Biapical pleural scarring is seen.  Density projecting posterior to the spine
 inferiorly on lateral view likely corresponds to subpleural fat, as seen on CT
 from ___.  No acute rib fracture is detected, but the sensitivity of routine
 radiography for rib fractures is low.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with bibasilar edema versus atelectasis.  Repeat radiograph
 with improved inspiration may helpful to distinguish these entities. 
 Discussed with ___ by ___ by phone at 8:57 a.m. on
 ___ after attending radiologist review.
