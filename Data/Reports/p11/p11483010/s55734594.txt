                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness and confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta
 is markedly tortuous, and mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 Pulmonary arteries remain enlarged suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 with emphysema again noted, most pronounced in the upper lobes.  Prominence of
 the left superior mediastinum with mild rightward deviation of the trachea is
 compatible with known enlargement of the left thyroid lobe.  Patchy opacities
 are noted within both lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Left-sided
 Bochdalek's hernia is again unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, but no focal consolidation.
