                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left-sided chest pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again a
 calcified nodule is seen projecting over the right lower lung, likely
 represents a calcified granuloma.  The previously mentioned right upper lung
 dense nodule is not as well seen on the current study due to overlapping
 osseous structures, however, has not increased in size.  No new focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The hilar contours are stable. 
 No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
