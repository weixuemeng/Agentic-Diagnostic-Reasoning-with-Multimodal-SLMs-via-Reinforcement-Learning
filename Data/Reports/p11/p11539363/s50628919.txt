                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with nausea, vomiting, cough

 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy and linear opacity in left
 lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot
 be completely excluded.  The right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Mild
 anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear and patchy opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
