                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion, assess effusion or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the prior
 exam, there are small bilateral pleural effusions with basilar opacities
 likely representing dependent atelectasis.  While there is no overt edema, the
 possibility of mild interstitial edema is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  The mediastinal contour appears
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions with basilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis. Possible mild pulmonary edema.
