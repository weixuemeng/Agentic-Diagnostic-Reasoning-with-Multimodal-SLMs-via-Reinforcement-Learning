                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with HCAP, status post tracheostomy,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___, obtained 9 o'clock p.m.  The present portable chest
 examination in this very obese patient creates limitations as it does not
 cover the entire right-sided base of the thorax.  One can identify the
 tracheostomy cannula in place with its distal end properly aligned in the
 trachea, terminating some 6 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax
 has developed.  A right-sided PICC line is seen as before and is overlying
 territory of the right atrium in its termination point.  Withdrawal of the
 line by 4 cm is advisable so to be located in the mid portion of the SVC and
 to avoid any interference with cardiac structures.  No new pulmonary
 infiltrates can be identified.  The left-sided lateral pleural sinus is clear
 from any fluid accumulation.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chest findings can be identified on portable
 single view examination.
