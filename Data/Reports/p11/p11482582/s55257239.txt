                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 technical limitation of the image.  A tracheostomy tube and a nasogastric tube
 appeared to be in unchanged position.  Unchanged mild vascular and cardiac
 distention, likely reflecting mild fluid overload.  No larger pleural
 effusions are seen.  Retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged in extent, but no
 evidence of pneumonia.
