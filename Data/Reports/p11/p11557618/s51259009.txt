                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, COPD and
 worsening dyspnea with lower extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve
 replacement.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a
 moderate to large right pleural effusion, and a small left pleural effusion. 
 There appears to be an ovoid opacity projecting over the left inferior
 hemithorax which likely reflects a loculated component of the left-sided
 pleural effusion, but a pleural based mass is not excluded.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities right worse than left likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion appears to be asymmetric in primarily noted in the right
 lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate to large right and small left pleural effusions with bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis though
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  A component of the left pleural
 effusion is likely laterally loculated, but a pleural based mass cannot be
 excluded.  
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
