                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema, now moderate in degree is demonstrated which is
 asymmetrically more pronounced on the right compared to the left.  Moderate to
 large bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, slightly increased in size
 on the left, but relatively unchanged on the right. Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis, with linear opacities in the right mid lung
 field compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions. The
 aorta remains markedly tortuous. No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema which is asymmetric and moderate in degree, with
 moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. The
 left pleural effusion is slightly increased in the interval.
