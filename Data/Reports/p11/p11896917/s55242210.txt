                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragms is consistent with small pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.
