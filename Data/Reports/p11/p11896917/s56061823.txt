  1. Increased size of small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right
  greater than left with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
  2. New rounded opacities along the periphery of the right mid lung field which
  in this patient with known malignancy is concerning for metastases. Further
  assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea x 10days
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar chest tube has been removed in the interval with a small to
 moderate size right pleural effusion appearing increased in size compared to
 the most recent radiograph.  A component of this pleural effusion appears to
 be loculated laterally. Small left pleural effusion also has increased in the
 interval. New rounded opacities are seen along the periphery of the right mid
 lung field measuring up to 19 mm wide. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect areas of compressive atelectasis. Moderate size hiatal hernia is again
 noted. The cardiac and mediastinal contours otherwise appear unchanged. No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. Scarring is noted in the lung
 apices. No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
