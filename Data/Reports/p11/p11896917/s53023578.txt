 Presence of pleural effusion or chylothorax?  // please assess interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The lung
 volumes have slightly decreased. Areas of atelectasis at the lung bases are
 still present. The position of the right chest tube is constant.  Constant
 blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a minimal pleural
 effusion.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax. 
 The lucent line crossing the right lung apex is caused by a skin fold.
