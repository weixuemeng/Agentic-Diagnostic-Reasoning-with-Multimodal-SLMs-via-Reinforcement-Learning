                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right pleural effusion with underlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large
 right mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity.  Patchy medial left basilar opacity may
 relate to pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation
 is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right and small left pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying basilar consolidation not excluded.
