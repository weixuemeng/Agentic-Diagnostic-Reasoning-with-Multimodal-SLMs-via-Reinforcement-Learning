 Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially.  Cardiomegaly is still
 severe.  Small left pleural effusion, presumed.  Although there is no large
 area of consolidation, a small region of pneumonia could be missed.  Course of
 the left PIC line suggests that it might cannulate the azygous vein.  Feeding
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
