                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with new productive cough
 and history of bronchiectasis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ chest radiograph and chest CT from ___.
 
 The patient has substantial scoliosis with a hardware in place.  Bilateral
 breast prosthesis is redemonstrated, calcified.  Assessment of the lung
 parenchyma reveals no definitive new consolidations noted.  Given the presence
 of the hardware, correlation with chest CT as comparison to prior examination
 is beneficial for precise assessment of the lung parenchyma, but no masses,
 consolidations to explain patient's symptoms noted.
