                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 large region of irregular opacification in the lingula is similar to the prior
 examination and most suggestive of scarring perhaps associated with a prior
 infection.  There is a subpleural opacity at the lateral right lung apex which
 correlates with an irregular opacity on the prior CT.  There is also a similar
 persistent opacity at the left lung apex centered in the parenchyma. 
 Irregular lung architecture and relative lucency at the apices suggesting
 emphysema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly irregular opacification of the left mid lung as well as
 opacities at the lung apices, as seen previously, apparently chronic in nature
 with no definite radiographic finding suggestive of a superimposed acute
 process.
