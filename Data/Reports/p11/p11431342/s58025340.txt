                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of HIV and two-week history of fevers and
 productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate increased lung volumes,
 compatible with patient's known history of extensive emphysema.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.   There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral reticulo-nodular opacities,
 most pronounced in the lower lobes, have progressed since ___ exam.
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral reticulonodular opacities, most pronounced in the lower lobes,
 have progressed since ___ exam, and likely represent infection in
 appropriate clinical setting.  Atypical infection is a consideration, given
 patient's clinical status.  Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.  
 
 2.  Emphysema.
