                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with bypoxia  // volume overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal and there is marked prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery and right descending pulmonary artery. Linear opacities in
 the left greater than right lung bases are consistent with atelectasis.
 Pulmonary vascular markings appear within normal limits and there is no focal
 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and prominence of the right
 descending pulmonary artery suggest pulmonary hypertension.
