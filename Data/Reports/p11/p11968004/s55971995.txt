                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT of the chest dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A dual-lead
 pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. Allowing for small differences in
 technique, substantial cardiomegaly is probably unchanged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are also probably unchanged. New opacity is suggested by vague
 opacification projecting over the lower spine on the lateral view probably
 localizing to the left lower lobe.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the posterior left lower lobe, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 Marked, but similar, cardiomegaly.
