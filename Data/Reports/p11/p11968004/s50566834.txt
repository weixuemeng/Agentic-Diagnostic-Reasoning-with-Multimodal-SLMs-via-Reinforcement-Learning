                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is markedly enlarged, as seen
 previously, but may be more exaggerated on this exam by low lung volumes. 
 Dual-lead pacing hardware is similarly positioned with generator projecting
 over the left upper outer chest.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  There is pulmonary vascular prominence with mild
 congestion.  Sternal wires appear intact on these views.  No rib fracture is
 detected on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Persistent cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 2. No rib fracture detected, but sensitivity is limited on routine chest
 radiography.  If clinical suspicion is high, dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by ___
 by telephone at 10:20 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery of these
 findings.
