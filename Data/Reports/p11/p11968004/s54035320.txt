 HISTORY:  Fall on Pradaxa.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged with left atrial
 enlargement.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No
 pulmonary edema is visualized.  Lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar
 opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  No
 displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No displaced fracture seen.
 If there is continued concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series
 is recommended.
