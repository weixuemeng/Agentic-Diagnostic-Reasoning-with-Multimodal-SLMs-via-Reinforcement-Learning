 The posterior costophrenic angles are not well seen on the lateral view which
 may be technical, although trace pleural effusions may be present.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable, with persistent cardiomegaly.  There is possible minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
