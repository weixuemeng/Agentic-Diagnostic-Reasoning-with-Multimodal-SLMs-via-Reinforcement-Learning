                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval since the prior study, there has been development
 of a moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, left base
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle and a small pleural effusion may be present.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, new since the
 prior study.  Underlying left base consolidation is difficult to exclude.
 2.  Persistent slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a
 small pleural effusion.
