                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New-onset shortness of breath after drinking water, assess
 aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Since the prior
 exam, there are increased bilateral lower lung opacities which may represent a
 combination of effusion and consolidation.  The possibility of aspiration is
 difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.  There is a dextroscoliosis of the spine,
 apex at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing lower lung opacities, left greater than right, likely
 representing a combination of effusion and consolidation.
