                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion after
 thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier.
 
 There is interval decrease in left pleural effusion after thoracocentesis and
 currently the effusion is small and partially loculated.  There is no
 substantial pneumothorax.  Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Right PICC line
 tip is at the level of mid SVC.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  The left
 retrocardiac opacity might reflect atelectasis, but infectious process cannot
 be excluded.  Pigtail catheter is in place.
