                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some decrease in the
 degree of bilateral pleural effusions, which may merely be a manifestation of
 a more upright position of the patient.  There is extensive retrocardiac
 opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.  This could reflect
 merely substantial volume loss in the lower lobe, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is no evidence of acute
 vascular congestion.
