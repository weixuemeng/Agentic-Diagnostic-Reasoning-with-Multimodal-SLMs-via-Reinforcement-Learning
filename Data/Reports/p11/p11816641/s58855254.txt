 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:24 PM
  Lower apparent position of right PICC likely due to poor inspiratory effort -
  terminates at level of cavoatrial junction.  Unchanged left lower lobe
  opacity.  No other change from recent prior. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute onset tachypnea.  Assess for aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Right PICC tip is in the right
 atrium, can be withdrawn 1-2 cm for more standard position.  New right lower
 lobe opacities are a combination of small effusion and adjacent atelectasis. 
 Given the clinical suspicion of aspiration, this cannot be totally excluded. 
 Left lower lobe opacities consistent with a large area of atelectasis and
 small effusion are unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
