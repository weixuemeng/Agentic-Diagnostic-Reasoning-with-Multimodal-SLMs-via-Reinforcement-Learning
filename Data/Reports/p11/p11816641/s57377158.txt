                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, pulmonary embolism while hospitalized, on heparin. 
 Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right PICC line has been pulled back and now terminates in the low SVC. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and vascular congestion is unchanged.  There is no frank
 pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are larger.  Retrocardiac opacity
 is likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is no
 apical pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are larger.
 
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion are unchanged.
