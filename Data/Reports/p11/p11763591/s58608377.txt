                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Persistent small left pleural effusion is
 noted, with slight interval worsening of adjacent left basilar opacity likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion,
 and the right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion with slight worsening of adjacent left
 basilar opacity likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
