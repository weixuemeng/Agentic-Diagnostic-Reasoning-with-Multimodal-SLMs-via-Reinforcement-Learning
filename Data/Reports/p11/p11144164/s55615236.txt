  1. Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and enlargement of the main pulmonary
  artery with pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema.
  2. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely accounted for by
  pleural effusions and atelectasis. An underlying pneumonia, especially at the
  left base, would be difficult to exclude in the proper clinical setting.

 1. Persistent moderate cardiomegaly and enlargement of the main pulmonary

 2. No large pleural effusion.  A small pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude given limitation of patient's body habitus.  There is no convincing
 evidence of pneumonia.
