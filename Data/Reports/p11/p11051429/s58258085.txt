                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting on postoperative day #4 after right
 knee replacement, now with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator and leads are in
 unchanged expected position.  There is new mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 though no overt interstitial edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted.  Patchy basilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis.  No definite
 confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Apparent
 interval enlargement of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours may be partly
 due to vascular congestion, though also may be because of the AP technique. 
 Surgical clips seen in the region of the thoracic inlet may be related to
 prior thyroid surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and new small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
