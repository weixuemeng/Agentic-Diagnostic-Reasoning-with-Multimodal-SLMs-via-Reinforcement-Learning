 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly which is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar, with fullness at the right
 paratracheal stripe which again may reflect tortuous vessels.  Clips in the
 lower neck indicate prior thyroidectomy.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
