                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right facial droop, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 again noted. The aorta remains tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 somewhat.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted with patchy bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, likely reflective of atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Surgical
 clips are again noted at the thoracic inlet suggestive of prior thyroid
 surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Probable bibasilar atelectasis however
 infection in the left lung base cannot be completely excluded
