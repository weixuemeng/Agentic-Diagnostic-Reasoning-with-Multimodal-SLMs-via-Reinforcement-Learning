 for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size, normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.  In the right upper back, there is focal convexity

 fractures are identified.  If continued clinical concern rib views could be
 obtained.
