                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD and intubated in the ICU  // Assess
 for lung mass/effusion and placement of ET tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the interval since the prior study, the patient has been intubated.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the level the carina. 
 The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study which limits assessment of
 the cardiomediastinal contour.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  The masslike
 opacity seen on the prior study is not clearly visualized on today's study. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar when compared to the prior
 study.  Linear atelectasis in left mid lung.  Left shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema.
 Left lower lobe atelectasis obscures the left lower lobe mass seen on the
 prior study.
