                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated, worsening edema  // pulm edema? PNA 
 pulm edema? PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Again there is severe widening of the
 upper mediastinum and cardiac silhouette, both of which are longstanding.  The
 in the left upper lobe mass is obscured by the heart.  Opacification at the
 right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 pleural fluid and underlying atelectatic changes.
 There is only mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
