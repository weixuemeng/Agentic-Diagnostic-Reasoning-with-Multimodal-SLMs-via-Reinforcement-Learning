                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated, worsening edema  // Interval change 
 Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 03:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 00:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  Left
 retrocardiac mass unchanged.  Improving aeration at the bases with residual
 patchy opacities suggestive of resolving atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient positioning between studies.  No obvious pneumothorax or large
 effusions.  Apparent curvilinear lucency projecting beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm and in the epigastric region are felt to more likely be
 artifactual rather than representing free intraperitoneal air given semi-erect
 positioning, but this can be better assessed on followup imaging.  Multiple
 old left-sided rib fractures.
