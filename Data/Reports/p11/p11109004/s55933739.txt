                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained demonstrates midline
 sternotomy wires.  Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral moderate-sized pleural
 effusions with lower lobe consolidation is noted likely representing
 compressive atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  The heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Upper lungs appear grossly well aerated without
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral moderate pleural effusions
 and consolidative opacities in the lower lungs likely representing
 atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia.
