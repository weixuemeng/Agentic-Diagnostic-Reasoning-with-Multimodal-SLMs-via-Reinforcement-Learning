                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old woman with a history of a flutter now with dyspnea,
 evaluate for fluid overload or infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left upper chest pacer device with associated dual leads in
 unchanged appropriate position overlying the right ventricle and right atrium.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged, consistent with stable mild
 cardiomegaly. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. There is no right pleural
 effusion. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, consistent with a
 small left pleural effusion. There is a retrocardiac opacity and silhouetting
 of the left hemidiaphragm, likely representing basilar atelectasis in the
 setting of ipsilateral pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion likely with adjacent left basilar atelectasis.
 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema.
