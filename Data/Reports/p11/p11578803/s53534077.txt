  1.  Again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax. The apparent resolution of
  the deep sulcus sign on the left may be due to patient positioning. There is
  no evidence of rightward mediastinal shift.
  
  2.  Increased opacity at the left base likely represents a combination of
  pleural effusion and atelectasis.
  
   These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
  10:10pm on ___, at the time of discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Please get CXR at 9:00 PM**___ year old woman s/p AVJ ablation and
 BIV pacer placement ___-c/b pneumothorax  // ___ year old woman with left
 sided pneumothroax s/p chest tubeQuestions to be answered: surveillance of
 pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 17:38
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the known left apical pneumothorax is
 unchanged. There is increasing blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely
 caused by a small pleural effusion.  The small pleural catheter on the left is
 constant.  No evidence of tension. Normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette
 and of the right lung.
