                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 The patient is after median sternotomy and most likely mitral valve
 replacement.  Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Mediastinal position is
 unremarkable as well.  Enlargement of the left atrium is prominent.  Extensive
 calcifications of coronary arteries and aorta are noted.
 
 As compared to the prior study from ___, current study
 demonstrates no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Fiducial marker in the left
 upper lung is present, corresponding to a vague ground-glass opacity seen on
 the CT from ___.  No definitive mass is currently seen. 
 Questionable opacity in the right apex cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Hyperinflation is present.  The lateral
 view demonstrates multiple mild-to-moderate wedge compression fractures.  They
 appear unchanged since the prior study.
