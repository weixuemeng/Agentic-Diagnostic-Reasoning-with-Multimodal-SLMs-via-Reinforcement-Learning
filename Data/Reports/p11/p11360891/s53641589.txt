                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shock, CHF, PNA, sepsis  // interval change
 in intubated pt?      interval change in intubated pt?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 12:28 p.m. 
 Comparison:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 12:28 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Only mild pulmonary edema remains.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has
 improved over the past several days.  Transvenous right ventricular
 defibrillator lead unchanged in position, obscuring the tip of the right
 jugular line and beyond the mid SVC.  ET tube in standard placement. 
 Nasogastric tube can be traced only as far as the mid esophagus.  Conceivably
 conventional radiographs would be more successful in localizing the tip.
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.
