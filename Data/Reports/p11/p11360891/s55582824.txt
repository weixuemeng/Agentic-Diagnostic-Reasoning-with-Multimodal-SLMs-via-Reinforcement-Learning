                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:     ___-year-old man with a history of CHF status post ICD upgrade
 with attempted coronary sinus lead placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pectoral ICD with right atrial lead following its expected course and
 right ventricular lead oriented superiorly with proximal electrode spanning
 the SVC.  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggests hyperinflation.  Stable,
 moderate cardiomegaly.  Stable widening of the mediastinum.  Clear lungs.  No
 pneumothorax or hemothorax.  No appreciable pericardial effusion, but would
 not expect chest radiograph to detect a pericardial effusion.

 No appreciable pericardial effusion, but would not expect chest radiograph to
 detect a pericardial effusion.
 Mildly hyperinflated lungs.
