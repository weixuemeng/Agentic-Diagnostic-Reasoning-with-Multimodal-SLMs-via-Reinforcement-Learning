                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HIV, now with chest pain and cough, here to evaluate
 for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Opacities in the
 right lung base may reflect early pneumonia.  There is no significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  There is no free air beneath
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacities may reflect early pneumonia.
