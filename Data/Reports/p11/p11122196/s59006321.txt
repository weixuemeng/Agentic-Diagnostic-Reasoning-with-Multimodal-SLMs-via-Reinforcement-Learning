 Single AP supine portable chest radiograph provided demonstrates interval
 placement of a left IJ central venous catheter with which is seen terminating
 in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild
 hilar congestion appears increased.  Mediastinal prominence likely reflect
 supine portable technique.

 Appropriately positioned left IJ central venous catheter.  Increasing
 bibasilar atelectasis and hilar congestion.
