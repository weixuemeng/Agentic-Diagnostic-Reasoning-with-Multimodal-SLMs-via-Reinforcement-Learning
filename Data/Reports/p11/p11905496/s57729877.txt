                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  Areas of opacification in the right mid and
 upper zones are decreasing, probably reflecting improved contusion.  Streaks
 of atelectasis are seen at the left base as well.  No gross evidence of
 pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.
