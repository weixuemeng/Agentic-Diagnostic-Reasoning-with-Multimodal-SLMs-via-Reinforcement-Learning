                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Found down and intubated.  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal supine portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ET tube ending
 7 cm above the carina at the level of the thoracic inlet.  Low lung volumes
 and supine positioning accentuates mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube ends 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced for more secure
 positioning.
 2. Dilitation of the aortic knob could be secondary to aneurysm.
 3. Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
