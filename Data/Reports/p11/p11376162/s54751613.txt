                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R PICC  // Eval PICC line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 There are trace bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Large
 retrocardiac opacity most likely represents a hiatal hernia with adjacent
 atelectasis.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC without definite pneumothorax seen.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Large rounded retrocardiac opacity most likely represents hiatal hernia with
 adjacent atelectasis.
