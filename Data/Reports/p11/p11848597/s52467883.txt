  1. Interval placement/repositioning of a right chest wall pacemaker, with a
  single lead projecting over the right ventricle. Interval extubation and
  removal of nasogastric tube. Other supporting lines and tubes are unchanged in
  position.  No pneumothorax identified.
  2. Increasing opacity in the bilateral lung bases may be due to small
  bilateral pleural effusions, with superimposed atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p R subclavian pacemaker placement.  //
 Rule out pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  FINDINGS:
 
 
 ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices,
 with the exception of the left hemodialysis catheter, have been removed. The
 lung volumes remain low and the heart is substantially enlarged. Minimal fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Substantial retrocardiac and right
 basilar atelectasis. No new focal parenchymal opacities are visualized.
