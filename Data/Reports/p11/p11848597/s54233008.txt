  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates in the mid
  thoracic trachea. Lower lung volumes compared to the prior chest radiograph.
  The remainder of the exam is unchanged, with cardiomegaly, retrocardiac
  opacity, and likely left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cabg  // s/p intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been intubated. The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4 cm above the carina. 
 All other findings are constant, with the exception of slightly decreased lung
 volumes, that exaggerate the visual appearance of the thickness of the
 pulmonary vessels.  No complications, no pneumothorax.
