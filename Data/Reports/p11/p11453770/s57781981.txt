                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidations or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly,
 predominantly left ventricular enlargement, has increased.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Descending aorta is slightly tortuous.
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or vascular engorgement.  Degenerative change in the right upper lung is
 again noted.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly increased.  No other evidence of cardiac decompensation
