                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, concerning for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace
 pleural effusion.  Right upper lobe chain sutures are again seen.  Patchy
 opacity projecting over the lateral left mid lung is new since prior, and
 raises concern for infection/pneumonia.  Additional opacity projecting over
 the medial right lung base is more prominent as compared to prior, and could
 represent additional site of infection with overlapping vascular structures. 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity projecting over the lateral left mid lung is new since prior,
 and raises concern for infection/pneumonia.
 Additional opacity projecting over the medial right lung base is more
 prominent as compared to prior, and could represent additional site of
 infection with overlapping vascular structures.
