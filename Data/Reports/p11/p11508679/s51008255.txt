                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 828 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF and CAD, possible pneumonia, assess
 lung infiltrates.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portables semi-erect chest film ___ at 828 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, the tip not
 identified.  Right internal jugular catheter has its tip in the distal SVC,
 unchanged.  Right subclavian PICC line also has its tip in the distal SVC.  
 
 2.  Improving mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Persistent retrocardiac
 opacity and small bilateral layering effusions.  Opacity at the left base most
 likely represents compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.
