                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with STEMI status post cardiac catheterization, now with
 NG tube placement.  Please evaluate NG tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to chest radiograph performed two hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates  stable positioning of
 medical devices.  Nasogastric tube was seen coursing out of view; side port
 not demonstrated on current image.  Endotracheal tube tip position difficult
 to evaluate but appears approximately 3 cm from the carina.  There is stable
 mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  The appearance of decreased
 small left pleural effusion likely reflects patient positioning given short
 time period.  PICC line located in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube with tip coursing out of view.  Other medical
 devices are in stable position.  Unchanged exam.
