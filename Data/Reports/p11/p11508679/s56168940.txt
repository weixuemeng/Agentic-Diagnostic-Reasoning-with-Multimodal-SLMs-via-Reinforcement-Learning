 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube
 terminating 2.1 cm above the carina.  Nasoenteric tube is seen coursing

 Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of atelectasis are
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  3.5 cm round rim
 calcification projecting over descending aorta represents saccular aneurysm,
 better characterized on ___ CT, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
