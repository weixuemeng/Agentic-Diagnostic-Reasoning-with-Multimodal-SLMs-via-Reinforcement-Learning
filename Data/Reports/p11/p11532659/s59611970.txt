                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve replacement. 
 Heart size remains enlarged, similar to the prior study.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution with vascular
 indistinctness suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Additionally, small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is clearly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
