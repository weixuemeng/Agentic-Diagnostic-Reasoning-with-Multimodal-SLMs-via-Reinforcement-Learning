                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension following thoracentesis, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and chest
 CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity over bilateral lower lungs in the setting of recent
 thoracentesis is compatible with re-expansion pulmonary edema.  A small
 residual layering left pleural effusion is likely present.  Multiple
 metastatic lesions are unchanged from prior studies.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Re-expansion pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
