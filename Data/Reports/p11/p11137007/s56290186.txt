 equivalent volume of left lower lobe atelectasis and suggesting that the
 accumulation of left pleural effusion has been slowly progressive.

 pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest
 that any pericardial effusion is hemodynamically significant.
 
 Multiple pulmonary metastases have not changed appreciably since ___.  No
 pneumothorax.  Upper mediastinal contours are normal.
