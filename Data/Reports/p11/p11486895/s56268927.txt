 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is relatively elevated right hemidiaphragm. Linear right basilar
 opacities may be secondary to atelectasis. A 1.2 cm left mid lung nodular
 opacity is noted projecting over the posterior left seventh rib. The lungs are
 otherwise clear, there is no effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is noted.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.
