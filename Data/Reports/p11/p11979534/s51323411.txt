                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits the evaluation.  There is top normal heart size with a stable
 prominence of the mediastinum likely indicating an unfolded thoracic aorta. 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A subtle
 reticulonodular pattern within the lungs could indicate mild pulmonary
 congestion.  Bony structures appear intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible apparent mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 cardiomegaly.
