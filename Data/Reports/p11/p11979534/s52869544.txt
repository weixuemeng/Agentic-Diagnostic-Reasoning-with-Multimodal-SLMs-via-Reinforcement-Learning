                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 accentuating the heart size, which is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are otherwise stable.  A large left goiter deviates the trachea, and
 is unchanged.  There is no overt pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or large
 pleural effusion.  Atelectasis is present at the lung bases, although
 underlying infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis; however
 underlying infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
