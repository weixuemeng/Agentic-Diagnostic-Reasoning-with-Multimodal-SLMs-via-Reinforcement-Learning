                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 15:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been slight interval improvement in degree of lung inflation
 compared to the prior study.  Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are demonstrated in the aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  As seen previously, rightward deviation of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet is due to left-sided thyroid enlargement.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly improved lung volumes compared to the prior study.  Persistent
 bibasilar patchy airspace opacities which could reflect atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
