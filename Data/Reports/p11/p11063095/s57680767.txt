                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath, please eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Heart size is moderately enlarged, unchanged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly is chronic, likely
 reflective of pleural thickening.  Degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint are noted along with multilevel degenerative changes within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality including no pulmonary edema. 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of COPD.
