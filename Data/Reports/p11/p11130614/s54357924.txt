                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  The right heart border is
 partially obscured on the frontal view, which may be due to atelectasis. 
 However, there is no correlating abnormality on the lateral view.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  Surgical clips are noted around the expected location of the
 gastroesophageal junction.
