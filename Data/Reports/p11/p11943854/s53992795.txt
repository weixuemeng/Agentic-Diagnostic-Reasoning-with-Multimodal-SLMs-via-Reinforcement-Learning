                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath  // eval for infiltrate or
 pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central catheter is again noted, unchanged from prior exam. The
 lungs are well expanded.  There is generalized pulmonary edema. A right lower
 lobe consolidation is seen, which may represent atelectasis. There is a right
 pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is increased from prior exam.
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen, without frank edema. Persistent
 opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, have decreased slightly from the prior
 exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Generalized edema, right lower lobe consolidation, right pleural effusion, and
 increased cardiomegaly. Findings may all reflect heart failure, but
 pericardial effusion and pneumonia should also be considered.
