                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with renal failure and pleural effusion  // ?
 ptx s/p right ___      ? ptx s/p right ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14 20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 17 44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular dual-lumen large bore catheter again has its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left, although the right effusion has decreased in size in the
 interim given recent thoracentesis. Persistent bibasilar opacities with
 improved aeration at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Interval
 resolution of pulmonary edema.
