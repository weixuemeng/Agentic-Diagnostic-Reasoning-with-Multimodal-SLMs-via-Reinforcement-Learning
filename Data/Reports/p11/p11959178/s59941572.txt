                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The right mediastinal contour in the region of the
 ascending aorta appears abnormally prominent.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Marked
 gaseous distention of the bowel loops within the left upper quadrant of
 abdomen results in elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unusual right mediastinal contour, potentially reflective of a prominent
 ascending aorta, which can be further assessed with CT.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
