 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with

 unfolded aorta. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of
 CHF. No frank consolidation or gross effusion is detected. Atelectasis in the
 lower lobe posteriorly is similar to the prior film. Possible minimal blunting
 of the costophrenic angles posteriorly, unchanged. The bones appear markedly
 demineralized.  Surgical clips noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD, cardiomegaly, and slight upper zone redistribution.  No focal infiltrate
