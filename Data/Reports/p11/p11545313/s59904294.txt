 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contour appears similar
 with diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta noted. Mild pulmonary
 edema is minimally improved from the prior study.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions with left basilar patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple clips are seen within the right upper
 abdomen.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized with moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions with left basilar
 atelectasis.
