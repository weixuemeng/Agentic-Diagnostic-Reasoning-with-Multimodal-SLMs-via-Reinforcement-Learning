                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout image from a chest CTA of ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recently postpartum with shortness of breath and chest
 pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, distention of
 azygous vein, and engorgement of pulmonary vessels as compared to baseline
 scout image from ___.  Bilateral asymmetrically distributed
 alveolar opacities are present in the mid and lower lungs, worse on the right
 than the left, and most confluent in the right middle lobe with resultant
 obscuration of the right heart border.  Probable bilateral pleural effusions,
 but no visible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral asymmetrical airspace disease, which may reflect
 asymmetrical cardiogenic pulmonary edema from postpartum cardiomyopathy or
 from a pre-existing cardiac condition.  
 
 Differential diagnosis for diffuse airspace opacities in the early post-partum
 period also includes amniotic fluid embolism, aspiration pneumonia, and
 widespread infectious pneumonia.  
 
 Correlation with cardiac echo may be helpful for initial further evaluation if
 warranted clinically.
