 again mild to moderately enlarged. The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  There is mild tortuosity of the descending aorta. The
 lungs are hyperinflated and there is some flattening of the diaphragms which
 may relate to COPD. There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
