                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained.  Interval placement
 of an endotracheal tube which is seen with its tip approximately 2.7 cm above
 the carina.  There has also been placement of an orogastric tube with its tip
 coiled in the left upper abdomen.  There is increased opacity in the upper
 lungs bilaterally, right greater than left, which given the interval change
 could reflect aspiration.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  AICD is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET and OG tubes positioned appropriately.  Increased opacities in
 the upper lungs, right greater than left, question aspiration.
