                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF flare, now with worsening
 respiratory status, new leukocytosis, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 19:04.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 12:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacer in place with the leads terminating over the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  The
 heart remains enlarged with the left ventricular prominence, suggestive of
 left ventricular hypertrophy.  The aorta remains somewhat tortuous.  Streaky
 layering opacities in both upper lungs as well as at the right base are
 stable, most likely reflecting post-inflammatory scarring or parenchymal
 changes related to underlying emphysema.  In either case, there does not
 appear to be superimposed pulmonary edema or a definite acute infectious
 process.  Followup imaging should be considered if the patient's symptoms
 persist or worsen.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
