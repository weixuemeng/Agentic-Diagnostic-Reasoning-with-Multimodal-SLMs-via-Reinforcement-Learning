                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Likely COPD exacerbation, intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:33 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the
 endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, the pacemaker wires and the right
 central venous access line are unchanged.  The previously seen right upper
 lobe predominant opacities are minimally decreased.  This could be defect of
 increased ventilatory pressure.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  No parenchymal opacities have newly appeared.  Currently, there is
 no evidence of pulmonary edema.
