                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate ET tube placement.  New intubation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, the ET tube is present, tip
 approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  A left-sided pacemaker device is
 present, with tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:36 a.m., cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged,
 with cardiomegaly and prominence of the left ventricle.  There is prominent
 patchy opacity in the right-greater-than-left upper zones, with subtle
 opacities in the right mid/lower zones and in the left perihilar region. 
 These appear more extensive compared with ___, even allowing for
 differences in technique.  Retrocardiac density consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation is stable.Possible minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Patchy pulmonary opacities, predominantly in right-greater-than-left upper
 zones, but also subtly present in lower zones, worse compared with ___.  
 
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is stable.
