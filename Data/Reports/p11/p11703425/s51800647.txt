                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 normal in size and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely atelectasis, alternatively aspiration, as seen on the CT
 that followed.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Enlarged spleen
 displaces stomach medially.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis as seen on the
 CT scan that followed, otherwise unremarkable.  This examination neither
 suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 
 Splenomegaly.
