                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  The NG tube tip passes
 below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for right basal atelectasis and left perihilar atelectasis that should
 be reassessed on the subsequent radiograph.  The ET tube tip is 5.3 cm above
 the carina.
