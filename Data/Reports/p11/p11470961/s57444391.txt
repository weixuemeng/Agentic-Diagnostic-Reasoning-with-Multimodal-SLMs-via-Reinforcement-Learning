                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia and sob
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the arch. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Focal
 opacity is seen within the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.  There
 is likely a small right pleural effusion.  Left lung demonstrates streaky
 atelectasis at the left lung base but no additional sites of focal
 consolidation. No pneumothorax or left-sided pleural effusion is demonstrated.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia with possible trace right pleural effusion. Follow
 up radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
