                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG and aortic valve
 replacement, now after internal jugular line placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe but unchanged associated with bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasal atelectasis.  No change in the mediastinal appearance is
 seen, but there is slight interval increase in vascular engorgement that may
 reflect worsening in interstitial pulmonary edema/volume overload.  No
 pneumothorax.
