                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope, possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is persistent left basilar
 opacity compatible with an effusion.  There is probable underlying atelectasis
 noting superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Blunting of the right
 posterior costophrenic angle is compatible with trace right-sided effusion. 
 The right lung and left upper lung remain clear.  Prosthetic valves are again
 noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as are the osseous and soft
 tissue structures noting a mid thoracic wedge deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left-sided pleural effusion not significantly changed with probable
 underlying atelectasis.  Component of infection cannot be excluded.
