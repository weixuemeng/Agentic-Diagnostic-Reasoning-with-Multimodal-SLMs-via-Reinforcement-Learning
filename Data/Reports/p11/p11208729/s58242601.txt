                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Upper GI bleed requiring intubation for emergent EGD, here to
 evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 03:08 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed, terminating 2 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the left
 upper quadrant, likely within the stomach.  The inspiratory lung volumes are
 low with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube tip 2 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes and left
 basilar atelectasis.
