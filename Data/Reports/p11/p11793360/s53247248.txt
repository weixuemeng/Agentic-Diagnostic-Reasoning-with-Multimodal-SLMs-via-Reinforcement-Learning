                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, presumed recent pneumonia.  History of
 lung nodules.
 
 FINDINGS:  No studies for comparison.
 
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  There is some irregular density at the
 right base which may represent atelectasis, or a parenchymal nodule.  There is
 no focal consolidation.  Bony structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No signs for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Irregular density at the right base which may represent atelectasis versus
 a lung nodule (as reported).  Comparison to old films would be helpful to
 establish interval change.
