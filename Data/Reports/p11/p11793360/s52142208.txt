                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. Bibasilar opacities are present. There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Heart is top normal size. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes,
 however, aspiration or infection should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  A repeat PA and lateral view of the chest maybe helpful for
 further assessment of the lung bases.
