                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, wheezing  // please eval for PNA, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pectoral infusion port terminates in upper SVC.  Sternotomy wires are
 intact.  Lung volume is low.  Mild bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Calcification at the AP window likely reflect calcified lymph
 nodes in a unchanged from before.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is similar to before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing radiographic evidence for pneumonia is identified.  Mild
 bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis.
