                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest of ___, and chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive
 of a small pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity is noted, more conspicuous
 from prior exam.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is apparent
 thickening of the minor fissure.  Calcified lymph nodes within the AP window
 are again noted.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The
 heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Port-A-Cath tip
 projects over cavoatrial junction.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity is more conspicuous from ___ exam,
 which likely represents atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
