 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is

 cavoatrial junction.  Again, there are low lung volumes and minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Ovoid calcification projecting over the left mediastinum is
 again seen.  Subcentimeter left lower lung rounded calcification is stable and
 may represent a calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
