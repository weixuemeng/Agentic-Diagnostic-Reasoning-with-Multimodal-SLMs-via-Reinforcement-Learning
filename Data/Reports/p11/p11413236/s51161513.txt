                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with substernal chest pain who is two-month out
 from a CABG.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest
 CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right Port-A-Cath reservoir projects over the right chest and
 is currently accessed; the catheter tip ends in the lower SVC.  There has been
 interval placement of sternotomy wires, which are intact.  The heart size is
 within normal limits and the mediastinal hilar contours do not appear widened.
 Calcified AP window node again seen.  The lungs demonstrate left bailar
 opacity which is more linear in configuration on the lateral view.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left costophrenic angle opacity, somewhat linear on the lateral
 view, more suggestive of atelectasis or scarring, less likely small focus of
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion.
