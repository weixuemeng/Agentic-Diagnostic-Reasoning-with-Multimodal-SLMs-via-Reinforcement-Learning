                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation of the lung bases, with perihilar
 atelectasis.  Within this limitation, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of markedly low lung
 volumes.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip projects at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction, as seen previously.  Density in the aortopulmonary window
 appears similar compared to prior and likely corresponds to calcified nodes,
 as seen on prior CT.  Sternal wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation of the lung bases and heart size,
 without radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process on this single
 frontal view.
