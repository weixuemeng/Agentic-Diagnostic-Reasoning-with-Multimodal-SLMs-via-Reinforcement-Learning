                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or frank pulmonary edema.  The heart remains moderately enlarged, although
 this is accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  Calcified AP window
 node is again noted.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the
 upper-mid SVC, unchanged in position from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
