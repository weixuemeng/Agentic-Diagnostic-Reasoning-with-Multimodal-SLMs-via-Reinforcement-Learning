                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with h/o mast cell crisis presenting with cp and sob which
 she attributes to mast cell attack  // acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate a right chest port, its tip which
 projects within the upper superior vena cava, unchanged in position relative
 to prior study.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable relative to prior examination.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.    There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Nodular opacities
 within the in right infrahilar region likely reflect vascular shadows. Lung
 volumes are low. Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate.  There is no focal opacity
 convincing for infectious process.  Calcification on the AP window could be
 due to calcified nodes.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall stable appearance of the chest with low lung volumes and basilar
 atelectasis.
