                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent abdominal surgery and worsening pain.
 Evaluation for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior radiographs of the chest
 including most recent from ___ as well as ___. 
 This study is read in conjunction with outside CT of the chest from___
 ___ dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right Port-A-Cath
 in unchanged position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Median
 sternotomy wires are present, along with surgical clips in the left upper
 quadrant.  The heart is mildly enlarged, but stable compared with prior
 examinations, with redemonstration of calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.  A
 rounded opacity in the lower left lung likely correlates to a calcified
 granuloma as seen on CT of the chest from ___.  There is no evidence
 of pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 lung volumes are low, accentuating bibasilar atelectasis.  No subdiaphragmatic
 free air is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No subdiaphragmatic free air or other acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
