                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain radiating to the back and jaw.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___. CT chest (outside study) ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen. Peripheral opacity in the
 left lung base appears improved from the prior study, and may represent
 residual atelectasis with scarring. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable
 with unchanged calcified aorticopulmonary window lymph node compatible with
 prior granulomatous disease.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is similarly positioned.
 Sternal wires appear intact on these views. The patient is status post CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
