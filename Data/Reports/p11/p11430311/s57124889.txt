                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, now status post chest tube placement. 
 Evaluate for resolution or progression.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Allowing for
 changes in patient positioning, the small bilateral pleural effusions appear
 stable.  There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Low lung volumes
 accentuate the bronchovascular structures, though there is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change since the prior exam, including a stable
 size of the small bilateral pleural effusions.
