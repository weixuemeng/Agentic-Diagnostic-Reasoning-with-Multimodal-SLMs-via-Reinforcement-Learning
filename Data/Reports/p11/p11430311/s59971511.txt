                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as CT from ___ of the chest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral chest tubes have been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild suspected cardiomegaly. 
 There are patchy opacities in the mid-to-lower lungs with plate-like and
 streaky morphologies most suggestive of residual scarring and atelectasis. 
 Fissure are slightly thickened but there is no definite pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities that can probably be explained for the most part
 by atelectasis or atelectasis; pneumonia is doubtful, although difficult to
 entiredly exclude.
