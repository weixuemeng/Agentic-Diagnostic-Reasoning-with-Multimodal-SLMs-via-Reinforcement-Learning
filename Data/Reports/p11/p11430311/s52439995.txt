                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right internal jugular catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 2:42 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  A new right internal jugular catheter tip
 projects over the right atrium, but probably ends in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction given the low lung volumes.  Endotracheal tube has been
 retracted, now ending 4.3 cm above the carina.  Aeration of the right upper
 lobe has improved. Left upper lobe is obscured by an external device.
 Otherwise, there is no change from the prior study.  No pneumothorax.
