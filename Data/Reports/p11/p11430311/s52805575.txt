 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:31 PM
  1. Mild to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, mildy increased on the left
  from prior exam.  The left pleural effusion may have a loculated component
  laterally if the patient was fully upright during imaging.  
  
  2. Pulmonary vascular congestions, similar to prior.  
  
  3. New opacity in the right upper lobe, possibly representing atelectasis but
  cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:24 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent acute respiratory failure from
 epiglottitis now with worsening hypoxia.  Is there are enlarging pleural
 effusion, pneumonia or airway edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema accompanied by progressive vascular
 congestion and worsening severe cardiomegaly developed between ___ and
 ___.  Today, the edema has improved slightly, but in the meantime
 moderate left and small right pleural effusions developed and are slightly
 larger today than on ___.  Right perihilar consolidation has been
 worsening since early on ___.  Since it nondependent, it is most likely
 pneumonia, although occasionally acute mitral regurgitation can produce focal
 edema in the right upper lobe.  I doubt that this would continue to worsen
 while edema elsewhere has improved.  Lung bases are also much less well
 aerated.  I attribute this on the left to worsening atelectasis in the face of
 increasing pleural effusion, but on the right, it could be another focus of
 pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
