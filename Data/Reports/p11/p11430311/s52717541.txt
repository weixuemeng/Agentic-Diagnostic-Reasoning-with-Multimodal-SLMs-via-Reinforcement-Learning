 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dobhoff placement, please assess position 
 // position of dobhoff tube
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Dobbhoff
 catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip is not included
 on the image. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 Areas of platelike atelectasis are seen at both the left and the right lung
 bases. A small cortical lateral right-sided rib lesion is better appreciated
 than on the previous image and should be evaluated with a dedicated rib
 series.
