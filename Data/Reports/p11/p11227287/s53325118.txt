                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left loculated pleural effusion and
 spiculated lung mass now s/p diagnostic thoracentesis and chest tube. Please
 assess for pneumothorax  // Assess for pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, the left pleural effusion is markedly smaller, with
 some probable pleural fluid along the medial aspect of the lower left lung.  A
 chest tube is in place at the left lung base.  There is a probable tiny left
 apical pneumothorax.  Again seen is a spiculated opacity in the left
 suprahilar region, with surrounding hazy opacity in the left upper zone,
 consistent with known mass.  The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF,
 infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinum remains midline.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked interval improvement in the left pleural effusion, with left lung base
 chest tube now in place.  Probable tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise,
 I doubt significant interval change.
