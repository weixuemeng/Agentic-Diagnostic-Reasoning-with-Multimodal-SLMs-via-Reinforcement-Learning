                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and head CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Volume loss in the left lung is re-
 demonstrated with leftward shift of mediastinal structures again noted. 
 Nodular and interstitial opacities are again seen throughout the left lung,
 most pronounced in the left lung base, along with left suprahilar mass
 compatible with known malignancy.  Left-sided pleural thickening is seen
 diffusely with a small to moderate size left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
 edema, or right-sided focal consolidation, right-sided pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Known osseous metastatic lesions within the
 thoracic spine are better seen on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of a left suprahilar mass compatible with known malignancy
 with lymphangitic spread in the left lung and continued diffuse left-sided
 pleural thickening with a small to moderate left pleural effusion.  No new
 focal consolidation identified in the right lung.
