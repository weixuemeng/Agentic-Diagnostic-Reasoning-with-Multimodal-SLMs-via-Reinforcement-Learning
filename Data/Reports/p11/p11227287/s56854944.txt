 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with malignant pleural effusion s/p pleuroscopy,
 pleurX catheter and chest tube placement.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided PleurX catheter and chest tubes are unchanged in position.  There
 is significant increase in the left chest wall and left base of neck
 subcutaneous air.  Correlation for air leak is recommended.  Heart size and
 retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Diffuse increase in interstitial
 opacity of the left lung is again seen.  Left effusion and atelectasis is
 slightly worse than on the prior study. The right lung is clear.  No
 right-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Significant interval increase in left chest wall and base of neck
 subcutaneous air, for which correlation with side port positioning of the
 PleurX and chest tube is recommended.
 2.  Interval increase in left effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
