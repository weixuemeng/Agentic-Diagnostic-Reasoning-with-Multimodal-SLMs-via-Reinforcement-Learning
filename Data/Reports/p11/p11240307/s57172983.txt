                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 16:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 16:01 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary edema.  A linear opacity in the right mid lung may
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  More focal patchy opacity at
 the left lung base is seen which could reflect an area of patchy atelectasis,
 early pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes in the
 thoracolumbar spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
