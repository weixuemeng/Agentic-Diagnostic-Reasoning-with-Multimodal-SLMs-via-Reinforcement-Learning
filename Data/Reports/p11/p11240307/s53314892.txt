                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 New opacity adjacent to the right heart border is most likely due to
 near-collapse in the right middle lobe.  Large right pleural effusion has
 increased with increasing adjacent atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.  The left
 lung is grossly clear.
