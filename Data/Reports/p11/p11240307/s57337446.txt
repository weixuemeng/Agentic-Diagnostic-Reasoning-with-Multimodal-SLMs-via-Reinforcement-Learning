                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal carcinomatosis, to assess for pneumonia and effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again a small
 pleural effusion on the left and a more prominent effusion on the right with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 The upper two-thirds of both lungs are clear and there is no vascular
 congestion.
