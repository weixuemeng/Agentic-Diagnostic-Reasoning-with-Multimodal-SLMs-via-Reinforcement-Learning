 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, evaluation for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the second of two radiographs, the one acquired at 7:59 p.m.,
 the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube
 is in correct position.
 
 As compared to the previous image, there is a substantial increase in severity
 of the bilateral predominantly central pulmonary edema and of the coexisting
 parenchymal opacities, slight increase in extent of the pre-existing pleural
 effusions.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
