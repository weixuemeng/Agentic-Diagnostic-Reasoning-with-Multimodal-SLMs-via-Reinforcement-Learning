 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable frontal view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study moderate bibasilar layering pleural
 effusions have substantially increased.  A superimposed infectious process at
 the left lung base is possible in the proper clinical setting.  There is mild
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  A tunneled right IJ central venous catheter tip
 terminates in the right atrium.  A left pectoral single-chamber pacemaker lead
 projects in unchanged location.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Substantial interval increase in moderate bibasilar layering pleural
 effusions and mild edema.
 2. Superimposed infectious process in the left lung base is possible in the
 proper clinical setting.
