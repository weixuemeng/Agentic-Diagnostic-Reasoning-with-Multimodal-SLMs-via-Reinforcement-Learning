                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with  CHF s/p ICD, DM1, ESRD s/p renal
 transplant on immunosuppression, CAD, and CVA with worsening chest pain s/p
 catheterization.  // Evidence of dissection s/p catheterization
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent study from earlier the same date, diffuse pulmonary
 edema has slightly worsened and is accompanied by slight increase in bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Overall appearance of thoracic aortic contour is
 unchanged, but please note that conventional radiographs are relatively
 insensitive for detecting aortic dissection.  If this diagnosis is suspected
 clinically, dedicated CT angiography would be recommended.
