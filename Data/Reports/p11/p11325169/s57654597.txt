                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, dyspnea.  Rule out acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  As compared to prior chest examination, there has been
 interval removal of right-sided central venous catheter.  Residual patchy
 opacity at the right lung base likely relates to resolving consolidation, with
 the previously noted right upper lobe opacity completely resolved.  No new
 focal consolidations are identified.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are smaller than on the prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Continued resolving pneumonia.  No new focal consolidations identified.
 Decreased size of tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
