                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP Chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitium with increased opacity in
 both lower lobes.  This likely represents mild pulmonary edema with asymmetric
 involvement of the lower lobes; however aspiration or aspiration pneumonia
 cannot be excluded. The heart is mildly enlarged.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions. No pneumothorax present. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema. More confluent bibasilar opacities
 could reflect dependent distribution of edema or a coexisting process such as
 aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs after
 diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
