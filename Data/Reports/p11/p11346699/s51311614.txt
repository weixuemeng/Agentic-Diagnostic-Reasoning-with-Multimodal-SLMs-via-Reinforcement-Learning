 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___; ___;
 ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.

 enters the proximal stomach and is out of view.  ET tube is 6.5 cm at level of
 carina and is in appropriate position.  
 
 Improved aeration in the upper lobes bilaterally with increase in density of
 right lower lobe opacity with new central lucency worrisome for cavitation. No

 size is top normal with normal mediastinal contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable left lower lobe pneumonia with interval increase in density of right
 lower lobe pneumonia with new area of cavitation.
