                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post arrest, now intubated, here to
 evaluate OG tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 06:32 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 and side port out of view on this image.  An endotracheal tube is in place
 with the tip terminating just above the thoracic inlet, approximately 8 cm
 above the carina.  There is increased dense consolidation at the right middle
 lobe with air bronchograms from the most recent prior study.  No significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 mildly engorged, with patchy opacities at the left lung base, representing
 asymmetric dependent pulmonary edema or infection/aspiration.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tip and side port of enteric tube out of view on this image.
 2.  Endotracheal tube tip 8 cm above the carina.  Consider repositioning.
 3.  Increased right middle lobe consolidation, compatible with pneumonia,
 possibly related to aspiration event.  Patchy left basilar opacities may
 represent additional foci of infection or asymmetric dependent pulmonary
 edema.
 4.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
