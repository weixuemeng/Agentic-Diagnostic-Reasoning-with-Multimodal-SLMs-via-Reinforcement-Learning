                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with respiratory failure
 and septic shock.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is no change in the position of tubes and lines as well as in the
 bilateral consolidations, although the impression is that there is slight
 interval progression of left mid and lower lung consolidation concerning for
 the progression of multifocal aspiration pneumonia.  No appreciable change in
 the bilateral pleural effusion is demonstrated, which is at least moderate.
