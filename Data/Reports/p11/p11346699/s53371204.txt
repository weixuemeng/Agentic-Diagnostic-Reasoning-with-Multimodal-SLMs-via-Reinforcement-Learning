                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is in
 a slightly more proximal position, with the tip of the tube projecting 7 cm
 above the carina.  The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  The course and
 position of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.
 
 The dominating opacity at the right lung base is slightly improved in
 severity, but still very extensive.  The opacity today shows a rounded
 hyperlucency that might reflect a cavitation.  The multiple bilateral
 widespread other multifocal opacities are unchanged in extent and
 distribution.  No larger pleural effusions.
