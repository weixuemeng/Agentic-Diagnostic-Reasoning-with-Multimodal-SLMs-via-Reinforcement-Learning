 As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are
 unchanged.  The position of the nasogastric tube is also unchanged, with the
 tip projecting over the middle parts of the stomach. Endotracheal tube and the
 right internal jugular vein catheter are constant in appearance.  The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities have minimally improved, but the lung
 volumes remain low and the cardiac silhouette is still slightly enlarged.
