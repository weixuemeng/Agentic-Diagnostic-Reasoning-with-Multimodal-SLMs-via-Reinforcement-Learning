                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Repositioned OG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW INCLUDING THE UPPER ABDOMEN.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:36 a.m.
 
 The NG tube has been advanced.   The tip overlies the expected location of the
 fundus, near the GE junction, but a large segment of the tube lies coiled in
 the stomach.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval advancement of NG tube.  It now overlies the stomach. 
 Please see comment above.
