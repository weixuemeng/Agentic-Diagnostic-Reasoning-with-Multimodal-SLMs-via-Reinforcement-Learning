                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, intubated, ET position.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the upper edge of the thoracic inlet,
 above the level of the medial clavicular heads and approximately 6.7 cm above
 the carina, and should be advanced by approximately 3 cm and reevaluated. An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged, though likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  There are alveolar
 opacities throughout much of the left lung and portions of the right lung.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect pulmonary edema.  The
 possibility that this is accentuated by low lung volumes and semi-erect
 positioning, however, cannot be excluded.  
 
 Compared with ___, the ET tube position is higher.  The opacities are
 similar, and possibly slightly worse.  
 
 The covering physician, Dr ___, was paged at 4:21 p.m. on the day of
 the exam and the ETT findings were discussed with her shortly thereafter
 (___, phone).
