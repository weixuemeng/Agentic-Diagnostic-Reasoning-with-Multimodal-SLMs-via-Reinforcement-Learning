 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diffuse GGO now being intubated  // ET
 tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, most recently 09:47
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are much lower than earlier in the day, but nevertheless it can
 be seen that the extent of pulmonary opacification has advanced considerably.
 Only the base of the right lung laterally is spared what has be come confluent
 consolidation, previously ground-glass opacification.  This sequence of
 events, morphologic features, and distribution do not favor cardiogenic edema.
 Instead, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary drug reaction, and
 noncardiogenic edema are more likely, even though the heart is probably mildly
 enlarged. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.
 
 Newly placed endotracheal tube is in standard position. Right PIC line ends in
 the low SVC and nasogastric tube ends in the nondistended stomach.
