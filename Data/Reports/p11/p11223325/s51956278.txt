                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right-sided thoracic back pain, on
 prednisone, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest demonstrate streaky opacity in the right
 lung base, possibly atelectasis. Remainder of the lungs are clear without
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size,
 the mediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen.  If there is further concern for rib fracture,
 recommend repeat dedicated views with BB marker to mark the site of pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streak right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
