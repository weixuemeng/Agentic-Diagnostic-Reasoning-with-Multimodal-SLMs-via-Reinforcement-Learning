                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with elevated INR and subdural hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes
 result in bronchovascular crowding.  Mild opacity at the right lung base
 probably represents crowding of vessels but may represent aspiration or
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  A 1 cm opacity at right upper
 lung.  The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal size, allowing for
 patient position and technique.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Rounded opacity in the retrocardiac region is
 suggestive of a hiatal hernia.  Surgical clips project over the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right basilar opacity is probably crowding of vessels, but may represent
 aspiration or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  1 cm opacity projects over right upper lung, likely asymmetric
 degenerative changes; however, repeat PA/lateral views with apical lordodic
 view as well suggested to exclude lung lesion.
