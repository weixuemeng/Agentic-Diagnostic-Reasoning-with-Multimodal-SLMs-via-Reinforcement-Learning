                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall while intoxicated and facial injuries  //
 aspiration evidence?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___ from
 an outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple surgical clips are seen along the right neck consistent with prior
 thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection.
 
 The heart appears somewhat enlarged but this is likely technical due to the
 projection and low lung volumes.  The aorta is tortuous and shows a calcified
 wall, as before.  Lung volumes are low however there is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Of note, this study is not particularly sensitive for the detection of rib
 fractures. Consider marking focal findings and obtaining dedicated rib
 radiographs if clinically indicated.
