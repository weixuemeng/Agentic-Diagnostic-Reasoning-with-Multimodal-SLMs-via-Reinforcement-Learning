                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML, COP/BOOP, now with worsening
 peribronchial opacities, awaiting VATS  // R/o worsening opacities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study the major interval change is interval mild positioning
 of the ET tube which is too high and should be advanced at least 5 cm,
 currently slightly E below the vocal cords. Widespread parenchymal opacities
 appear to be slightly more progressed but that potentially might reflect
 suboptimal ventilation. There is unchanged appearance of substantial:
 Dilatation. No pneumothorax is seen. Small amount of pleural effusion most
 likely present
