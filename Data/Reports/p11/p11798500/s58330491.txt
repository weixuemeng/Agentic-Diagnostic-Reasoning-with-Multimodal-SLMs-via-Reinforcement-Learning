                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Likely COP, but acutely hypoxic, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Also comparison to chest CT from
 ___.
 
 The lung volumes are slightly low. There is patchy opacity in the right lung,
 predominantly in the right mid and lower zones and most pronounced in the
 right lower zone.  There are fainter, less extensive opacities in the left mid
 and lower zones.  No gross effusion, though small effusion would be difficult
 to exclude.   No definite cardiomegaly.  No upper zone redistribution to
 suggest CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Infiltrates, right greater than left, in keeping with findings on the ___
 chest CT.  It is difficult to determine whetherthe findings  today are more
 pronounced than on the CT, but that may very well be the case.  As indicated
 on the CT report, the differential diagnosis includes COP/BOOP, but also
 includes infection and,in the appropriate clinical setting, leukemic
 infiltrates.
