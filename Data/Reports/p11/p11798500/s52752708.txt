                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little interval change
 in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Continued low lung volumes
 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  The left IJ catheter tip again extends to the low SVC or
 cavoatrial junction.  Right subclavian line has been removed.
