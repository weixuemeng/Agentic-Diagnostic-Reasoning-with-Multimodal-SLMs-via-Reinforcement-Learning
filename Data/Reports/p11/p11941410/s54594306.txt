                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with myeloma  // Prior pneumonia and pleural
 effusions; assess for changes.      Prior pneumonia and pleural effusions;
 assess for changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In a study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration.  The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and the pulmonary edema has
 substantially decreased.  There is a right chest tube in place with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Relatively small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Increased opacification in the left mid zone most likely represents
 progressive clearing of the left mid zone pneumonia.  Retrocardiac
 opacification suggests mild atelectatic changes.
