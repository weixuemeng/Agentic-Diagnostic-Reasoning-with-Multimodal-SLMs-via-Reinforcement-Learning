                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, CHF  // r/o pneumonia     
 INCREASED COUGH HX CHF,MULTIPLE MYELOMA,BRCA,EFFUSIOSN R/O PNEUMONIA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 essentially within normal limits with moderate pulmonary vascular congestion
 and stable pacer leads.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the right base,
 though the costophrenic angle is sharp.  More prominent opacification is seen
 at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle.  Although this could
 merely represent atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
