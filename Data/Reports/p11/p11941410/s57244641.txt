                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increasing dyspnea, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a very subtle but
 noticeable increase in interstitial structures.  This is particularly evident
 on the lateral radiograph, rather than on the frontal image.
 
 Given the clinical presentation of the patient, CT should be considered to
 further evaluate these changes.
 
 No acute change is seen.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumonia.
 
 At the time of dictation, 12:01, on ___, a note was put on the
 radiology dashboard.
