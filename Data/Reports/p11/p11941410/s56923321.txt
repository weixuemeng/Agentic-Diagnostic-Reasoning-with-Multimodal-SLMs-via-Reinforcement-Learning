                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations, recent pneumonia. Rule out acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right more than left. A more focal opacity in the right lower lobe is likely a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Superimposed infection would
 be difficult to exclude. The heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. There is
 central congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. Left
 pectoral electronic device is constant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Focal opacity in the right lower lobe is likely combination of atelectasis
 and pleural effusion. Superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
