                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with multiple myeloma and autologous bone marrow
 transplant in ___.  Has breast cancer and presents with fever and worsening
 nonproductive cough.  On antibiotics and Lasix since admission.  Evaluate for
 possible pneumonia or volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___.
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality persists at the lung bases, and there is new
 heterogeneous opacification in the lower lobes, and small regions of
 abnormality in the upper.  Heart is normal size and unchanged.  Mild
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature has been stable since ___, and
 there is no mediastinal venous engorgement. The sequence of changes favors an
 atypical infection, opportunistic if the patient is immunocompromised.
 
 Moderate bilateral hilar enlargement is most likely some adenopathy.
 
 This interpretation is supported by the chest CT on ___ which showed
 extensive bronchiolar and acinar nodulation, a feature of infection,
 occasionally pulmonary hemorrhage, but not pulmonary edema.  Most likely
 pathogen is a virus.  In some immunocompromised patients, bronchiolitis
 obliterans can develop with this time course.
 
 Of note, very mild septal thickening on the ___ chest CT was considered
 possible pulmonary edema.  That may well be the case, but as stated above, the
 findings of airspace disease dominate.
