                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral pleural effusions  // f/u
 pleural effusions      f/u pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains in
 place with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Some prominence of interstitial markings could be a manifestation of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure or possibly some chronic pulmonary disease.
 The opacification in the left mid zone again most likely represents residual
 scarring from previous pneumonia.  Atelectatic changes are again seen at the
 left base
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with small pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening.  No evidence of the right pleural effusion.
