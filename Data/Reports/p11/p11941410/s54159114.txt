                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. There continues to be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, perhaps slightly worse in the interval. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases are increased compared to the prior study, with small bilateral
 pleural effusions, also increased from prior. No pneumothorax is present.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval worsening of mild pulmonary vascular congestion with increased
 size of small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening bibasilar opacities,
 possibly atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
