                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New tachycardia status post 5 vessel CABG 6 days ago with new
 bilateral pedal edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe
 likely reflects atelectasis.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 perhaps minimally increased compared to the previous exam.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, perhaps minimally
 increased in size compared to the prior exam with left lower lobe atelectasis.
