                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SDH, intubated  // ?fluid status      ?fluid
 status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies
 approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, little overall change in
 the monitoring and support devices.  The medial aspect of the left
 hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, consistent with atelectatic changes in this
 region.  Vague suggestion of some increased opacification just above the
 medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectatic
 changes.
 Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
