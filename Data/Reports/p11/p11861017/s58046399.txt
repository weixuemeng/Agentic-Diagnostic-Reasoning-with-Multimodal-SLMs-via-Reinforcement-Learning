                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p craniotomy   evacuation of SDH, reintubated for
 respiratory failure  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, but there is
 increased engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with
 worsening pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the right lower lung with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with a moderate right pleural
 effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base.  Less prominent effusion and
 volume loss in the lower lobe on the left.
