                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Linear left base opacity seen on the frontal
 view, not substantially on the lateral view, most likely presents atelectasis.
 No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear left base opacity more likely represents atelectasis than pneumonia,
 seen only on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view.
