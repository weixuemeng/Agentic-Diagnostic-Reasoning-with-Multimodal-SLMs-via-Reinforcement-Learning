                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with difficulty breathing  // ? infectious process
 
 COMPARISON:  CT neck performed today.  CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided. Lung volumes are low.  Mild right
 hemidiaphragmatic elevation is unchanged.  Vague opacity in the left lower
 lung could in part reflect bronchovascular crowding, difficult to exclude a
 very early pneumonia.  Upper lungs are well aerated.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  No radiopaque foreign body.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity in the left lower lung likely reflect bronchovascular crowding,
 difficult to exclude an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
