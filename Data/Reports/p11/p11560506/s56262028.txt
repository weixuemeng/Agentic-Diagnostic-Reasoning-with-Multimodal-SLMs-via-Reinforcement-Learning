                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall with shortness of breath and
 rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No evidence
 of rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no rib fracture is
 identified, this study is suboptimal for the assessment of rib fractures.  If
 there is high clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series or chest
 CT is more sensitive.
