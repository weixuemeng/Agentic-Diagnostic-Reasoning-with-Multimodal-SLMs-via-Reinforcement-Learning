                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes contribute to bibasilar atelectasis; however,
 there are no focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.  Cardiac size is
 also exaggerated by the low lung volumes.  The mediastinum is normal given a
 tortuous aorta.  The hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process given low lung
 volumes.
