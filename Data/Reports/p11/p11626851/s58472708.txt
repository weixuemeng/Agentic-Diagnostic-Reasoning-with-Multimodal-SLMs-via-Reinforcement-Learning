                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with L5-S1 disc herniation,
 pre-operative assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mild dextroscoliosis contributes to the tortuosity of
 the aorta.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax demonstrated.  
 
 There is questionable opacity projecting behind the left cardiac silhouette
 above the diaphragm that potentially might represent posterior hernia,
 correlation with lateral view is recommended.
