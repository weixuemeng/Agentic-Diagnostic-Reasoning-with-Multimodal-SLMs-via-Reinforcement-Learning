                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough for two weeks.  Weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Streaky right basilar and left
 mid lung opacities are seen, which may be due to atelectasis.  No definite
 correlate finding seen in the lateral view, noting that the patient's arms
 project over the upper half of the chest.  There is blunting of the right
 posterior costophrenic angle compatible with trace effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No definite acute
 osseous abnormality is identified noting degenerative changes at the
 acromioclavicular joints and left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively linear left mid lung and right basilar opacities,
 potentially due to atelectasis, infection is not entirely excluded.
