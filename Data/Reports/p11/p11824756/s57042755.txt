                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncopal event.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities are visualized in the
 lung bases and may reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis or overlying
 vasculature.  No confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia or
 aspiration.  The lateral view is clear.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 No vascular congestion, pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are identified. 
 Calcifications of the aortic knob are noted.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There are degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine with dense anterior osteophytosis at multiple levels.  No
 definite compression deformity is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear opacities may be related to overlying
 vasculature or atelectasis.  No confluent opacities to suggest pneumonia or
 aspiration.  No pleural effusion.
