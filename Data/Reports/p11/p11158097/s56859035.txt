 AP CHEST, 6:48 PM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new right IJ line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 3:32 p.m. and 6:15 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax, associated pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening.  ET tube
 in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach would
 need to be advanced 6 cm to move all the side ports below the GE junction. 
 Lung volumes are lower, partially responsible for worsening mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion may be present.
