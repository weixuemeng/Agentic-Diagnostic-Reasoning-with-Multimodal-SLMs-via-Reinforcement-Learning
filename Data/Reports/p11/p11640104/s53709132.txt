                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable, including mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly and a tortuous appearance to the aorta.  Widening of
 upper mediastinal contours is apparently due to tortuosity of the great
 vessels and also unchanged.  As better depicted on the lateral view there is
 an opacity in the posterior left lower lobe that is streaky and has increased
 but noting decreased lung volumes on the lateral view on this study.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Posterior basilar opacity which appears more prominent although likely due to
 persistent atelectasis accentuated by low lung volumes.  Follow-up radiographs
 could be considered, however, if clinical findings raise concern for
 developing pneumonia.
