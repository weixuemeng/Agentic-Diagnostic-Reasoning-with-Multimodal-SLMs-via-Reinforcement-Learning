                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal image of the chest was obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low.  This is accentuating the bronchovascular structures and heart size,
 which are likely normal.  There is an enlarged azygous vein which is
 suggestive of an elevated central venous pressure.  There is no definite
 pulmonary edema.  The left costophrenic angle is obscured, possibly due to a
 small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Very limited exam due to low lung volumes.  
 2. Enlarged azygous vein suggests elevated central venous pressure, for which
 the differential diagnosis is isolated right heart failure, a pericardial
 effusion, or a large pulmonary embolism.
 3. Probable small left pleural effusion.
