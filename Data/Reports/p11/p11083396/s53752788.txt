                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Medial right base opacity at the cardiophrenic
 angle is felt to most likely be due to overlapping vascular structures with
 possible some underlying atelectasis.  No definite correlate is seen on the
 lateral view.  There is no definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly low lung volumes.  Opacity projecting at the medial
 right lung base is felt to be due to overlapping vascular structures and
 possibly some underlying atelectasis.  No correlate is seen on the lateral
 view.  No definite focal consolidation.
