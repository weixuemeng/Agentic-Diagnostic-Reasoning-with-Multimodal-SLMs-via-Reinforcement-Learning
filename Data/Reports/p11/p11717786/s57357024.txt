 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:18 PM
  1. Elevated right hemidiaphragm with adjacent right lung base opacity, which
  may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the
  right clinical setting.  2.  Nodular opacity in the left lateral lung, which
  likely represents known metastatic lung disease, but cannot exclude an
  underlying infection.--___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o advanced cholangiocarcinoma w/ squamous
 cell carcinoma of lung who p/w resp destress ___, found to have peritonitis,
 now w/ productive cough and low grade fever despite zosyn/vanc. // Is there
 evidence of pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nodular opacity in the left mid lung is perhaps slightly smaller compared to
 the prior study although the opacities were substantially better compared to
 the ___ chest radiograph which could reflect areas of prior
 hemorrhage into the nodules or superimposed infection which is now improving.
 Lung volumes are slightly improved with persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. Right basilar atelectasis is more dense than prior. Left
 basilar atelectasis is improved. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with increased atelectasis
 at the right lung base.
 
 2. Nodular opacities in the left mid lung are perhaps slightly smaller than
 prior; although, substantially larger than the ___ chest radiograph.
 These changes in size could reflect hemorrhage into the nodule or superimposed
 infection which is now improving
