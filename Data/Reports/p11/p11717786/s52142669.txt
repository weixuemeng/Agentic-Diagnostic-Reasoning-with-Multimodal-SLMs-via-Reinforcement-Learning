                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Lung volumes are low and there
 is elevation of right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis, right base
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded. A nodular opacity in the left
 lower lung likely represents one or more of multiple lung nodules seen on
 abdominal CT with others not as well seen on chest radiograph. There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right lower lobe opacity may be due to
 atelectasis, pneumonia not excluded.
 
 2.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are evaluated on abdominal CT done
 subsequently.
