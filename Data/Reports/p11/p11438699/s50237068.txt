                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity suggests minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Mild rightward convex curvature
 is centered along the mid thoracic spine, where there is also mildly
 exaggerated kyphotic curvature.  Associated with this appearance is minimal
 unchanged anterior wedging of mid thoracic vertebral bodies, as well as
 suspected bony demineralization.  There has been no significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
