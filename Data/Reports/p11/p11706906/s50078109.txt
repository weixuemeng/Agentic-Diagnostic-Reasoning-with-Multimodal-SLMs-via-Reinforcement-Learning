                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with afib, RVR, worsening BP, ? incr pulm edema  //
 eval ? worsening pulm edema      eval ? worsening pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP Chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged.  There is calcification of the
 aortic knob.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial
 edema. More confluent opacities at the lung bases are also demonstrated, right
 greater than left.  No  large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified on
 this portable radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  More confluent
 opacities at the lung bases could relate to dependent pulmonary edema,
 although aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
