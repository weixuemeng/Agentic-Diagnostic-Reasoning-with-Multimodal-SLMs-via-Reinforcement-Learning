                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated with recent endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal view of the chest is performed.
 
 An endotracheal tube is present, with the balloon inflated and the tip 4 cm
 above the carina.  A feeding tube is present with the port terminating in the
 esophagus.
 
 The lungs volumes are low.  Accounting for this, the mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Opacification of the
 retrocardiac space is thought to reflect atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactorily positioned endotracheal tube.  
 2.  Retrocardiac opacification, likely atelectasis.
 3.  Advancement of the orogastric tube by 5 cm is recommended for better
 positioning.
