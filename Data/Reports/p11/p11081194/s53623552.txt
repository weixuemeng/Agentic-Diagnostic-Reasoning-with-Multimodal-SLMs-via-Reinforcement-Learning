                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:38 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with no significant past medical history who
 developed flu-like prodrome for four weeks with worsening headaches,
 culminating in possible seizure, now requiring intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, tip between 3 and 4 cm above the carina.  An
 upper enteric drainage tube can be traced only as far as the mid-to-low
 esophagus, but the tip could be well beyond that.  I do not see an
 identifiable central venous line.  The heart is moderately to severely
 enlarged.  Mediastinal widening is attributable to vascular engorgement. 
 Pulmonary edema is not present.  Pleural effusions, if any, are not
 substantial.  No pneumothorax.
