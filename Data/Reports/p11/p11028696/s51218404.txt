                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and has increased slightly in size
 since the prior radiograph.  Aorta is tortuous.  Increased opacity overlying
 the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view, and is difficult to localize on
 the frontal radiograph, but may involve both lower lobes as both
 hemidiaphragms appear slightly obscured posteriorly.  Probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also demonstrated, with slight blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles.  Bones are diffusely demineralized. Mild compression
 deformities in mid thoracic spine, unchanged since CT of ___.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite findings to suggest active tuberculosis or previous
 granulomatous infection.
 
 2.  Patchy bibasilar opacities could potentially reflect aspiration or
 bacterial pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful to ensure resolution.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 4.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
