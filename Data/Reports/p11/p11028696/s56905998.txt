                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta
 remains tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sulci
 posteriorly on the lateral view suggests the presence of trace bilateral
 pleural effusions. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. There
 are moderate multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine with
 unchanged mild compression deformities within 2 adjacent vertebral bodies in
 the mid thoracic spine resulting in kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
