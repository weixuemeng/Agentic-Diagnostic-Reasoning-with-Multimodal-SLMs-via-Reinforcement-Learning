                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope, on amiodarone
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged
 but similar.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Low lung volumes
 result crowding of bronchovascular structures.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures with mild degenerative changes are
 again noted throughout the thoracic spine.  There is mild compression
 deformity of 2 adjacent vertebral bodies in the mid thoracic spine, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
