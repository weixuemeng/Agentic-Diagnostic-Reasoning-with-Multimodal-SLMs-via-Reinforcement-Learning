                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diarrhea, fever and tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There are patchy left basilar and right perihilar
 opacities, findings which could reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 noted. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left basilar and right perihilar opacities may reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Low lung
 volumes.
