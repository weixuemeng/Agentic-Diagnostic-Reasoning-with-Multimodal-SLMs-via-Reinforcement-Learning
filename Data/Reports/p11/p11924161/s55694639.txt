                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left lower lobe opacity resolution assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, currently there is minimal opacity seen in the
 left lower lobe and no pleural effusion.  It is better assessed on the lateral
 view.  Substantial hyperinflation of the lungs is noted with multiple rib
 fractures as well as wedge compression fractures of the vertebral spine.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Reevaluation of the patient is recommended in four
 weeks for assessment of entire resolution of left lower lobe opacity.
