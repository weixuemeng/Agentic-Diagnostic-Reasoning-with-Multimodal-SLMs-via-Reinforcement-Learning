                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a tortuous aorta.  The lung architecture appears coarsened, but
 there is no consolidation or pulmonary edema.  The hemidiaphragms are
 flattened, suggestive of chronic obstructive disease.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again clips project over the right lower
 chest.  Incompletely healed left rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Finding suggestive of chronic obstructive disease, but no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  Incompletely healed left rib fractures.
