                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left-sided
 pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:24.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single PA upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  In the
 interval since the prior study, there has been placement of a left-sided chest
 tube, terminating in the medial left lower hemithorax, with significant
 decrease in left pneumothorax with possibly a tiny left apical pneumothorax
 remaining.  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  There is left base retrocardiac
 streaky opacity.  This may represent atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Multiple old left-sided rib deformities are again
 noted.  Surgical clips overlie the lateral right lower hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with significant
 decrease in left-sided pneumothorax with possible only tiny residual left
 apical pneumothorax remaining.  Increased patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity may be due to atelectasis.
