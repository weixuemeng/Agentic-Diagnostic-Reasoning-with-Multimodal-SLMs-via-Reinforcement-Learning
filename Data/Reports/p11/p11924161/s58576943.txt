                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for pneumothorax status post removal of chest tube.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 00:35 a.m., the left-sided chest tube has been
 removed.  A small left apical pneumothorax is again seen, slightly larger. 
 Again seen is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 unchanged.  The opacities seen in the right upper zone on the prior film are
 much less apparent and appear to be resolving.  Continued attention to this
 area on followup films is requested.  Severe background COPD is noted.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 7:15 p.m. on the day
