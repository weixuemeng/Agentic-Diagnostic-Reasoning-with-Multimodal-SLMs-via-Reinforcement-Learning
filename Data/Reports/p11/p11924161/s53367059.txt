                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON  FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumothorax.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Current study still demonstrates small amount of left apical pneumothorax,
 slightly decreased since the prior study. Small amount of pleural effusion on
 the left is unchanged associated with minimal atelectasis.  Small amount of
 right pleural effusion is unchanged.  No new abnormalities within the lungs as
 well as no new changes in the appearance of the cardiopulmonary silhouette are
 demonstrated.  Right upper lung nodule is suspected, corresponding to nodular
 opacity seen on the CT torso and should be followed based on the previous
 recommendations: with a followup in three months given the history of breast
 cancer.
