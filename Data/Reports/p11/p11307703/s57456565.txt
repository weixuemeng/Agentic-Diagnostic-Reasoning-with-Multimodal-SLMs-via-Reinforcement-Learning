                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough s/p THA  // e/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes, with atelectasis at left-greater-than-right base. This may
 account for an area of increased density at the left base medially. Upper zone
 redistribution, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No CHF. No effusion or
 pneumothorax detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt but cannot entirely exclude an area of patchy opacity at the left lung
 base medially. If there is ongoing clinical concern for possible pneumonic
 infiltrate, than a lateral view could help for further assessment.
