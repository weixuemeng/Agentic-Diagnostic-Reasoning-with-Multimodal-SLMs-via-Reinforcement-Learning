                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ cellulitis, myositis s/p chest wall exploration, muscle,
 fascia bx  // assess for itnerval changes      assess for itnerval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower
 lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is
 increased opacification at the right base that could reflect either
 atelectatic changes or superimposed aspiration. The left hemidiaphragm is not
 well seen, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural
 effusion. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could reflect pleural fluid
 on that side.
 If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could be helpful.
