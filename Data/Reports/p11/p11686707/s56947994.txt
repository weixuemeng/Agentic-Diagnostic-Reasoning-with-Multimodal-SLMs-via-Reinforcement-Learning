                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope status post right pacer placement three weeks prior,
 question lead fracture.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is in place, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  No fracture of the pacer wire is detected.  No change in
 alignment is identified compared with ___.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, which could reflect COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly, with a calcified tortuous aorta.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, without CHF.  
 
 There is some focal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  This
 may account for increased opacity in the lower lobe posteriorly on the lateral
 view.  The appearance of this right cardiophrenic opacity on the AP view is
 more pronounced than on the film from ___, though similar to ___.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, the differential would include a small
 infectious infiltrate or focus of aspiration.  Otherwise, it would be
 compatible with a focus of atelectasis.
