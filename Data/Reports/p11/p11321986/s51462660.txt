                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of CHF, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate to severe
 enlargement of the heart size is re- demonstrated, unchanged.  Mediastinal
 contour is similar with central venous congestion again noted.  Hazy opacities
 are noted involving the perihilar regions and lung bases bilaterally in a
 relatively symmetric fashion, perhaps slightly worse in the left mid lung
 field compared to the previous radiograph.  No pneumothorax is present.  No
 large pleural effusion is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral hazy opacity involving the perihilar regions and lung bases, perhaps
 slightly worse in the left mid lung field compared to the prior study. 
 Findings may reflect mild pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of
 chronic interstitial lung disease which was better assessed on the prior CT
 chest.  No large pleural effusion.
