                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with status post Dobbhoff malplacement into lung
 and subsequent removal, now requiring assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval removal of the
 Dobbhoff tube from the right mainstem bronchus.  There is no pneumothorax or
 other complication seen.  Low lung volumes are again seen, which results in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Removal of Dobbhoff tube from the right mainstem bronchus without
 pneumothorax or other complication seen.  Otherwise, unchanged chest
 radiograph.
