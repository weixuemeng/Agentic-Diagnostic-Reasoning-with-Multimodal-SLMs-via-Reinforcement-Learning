                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited due to patient rotation. 
 The heart size remains top normal in size.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly likely unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There appears to be bronchial wall
 thickening noted in the left mid lung field.  Lungs remain hyperinflated,
 compatible with underlying COPD.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is visualized.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is present with a mild wedge compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, unchanged, and old left rib cage deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with bronchial wall thickening in the left mid lung field
 suggestive of bronchitis.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
