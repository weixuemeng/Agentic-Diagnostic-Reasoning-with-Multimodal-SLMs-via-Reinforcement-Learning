                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Headache and hypertension, assess for acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are linear
 densities in the lower lungs which are most compatible with scarring and
 appear essentially stable from the prior exam.  There is no definite sign of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with top normal heart size with
 atherosclerotic calcifications along the unfolded thoracic aorta.  The imaged
 osseous structures demonstrate diffuse osseous demineralization and old rib
 deformities in the left rib cage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of scarring in the lower lungs.  Please note, given this
 appearance, a subtle nodule may be obscured.  If there are elevated risk
 factors for lung cancer, non-emergent CT of the chest may be obtained.  No
 definite signs of acute intrathoracic process.
