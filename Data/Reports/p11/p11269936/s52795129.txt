                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Overdose, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.8 cm above the level of
 the carina.  There are low lung volumes.  Patchy right upper lung opacity,
 somewhat streaky, may relate to underlying aspiration, atelectasis and/or
 infection.  The left lung is clear.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely
 exaggerated by low lung volumes and supine, AP portable technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.
 
 Low lung volumes.  Streaky right upper lung areas of opacity may be due to
 underlying aspiration, atelectasis, and/or infection.
