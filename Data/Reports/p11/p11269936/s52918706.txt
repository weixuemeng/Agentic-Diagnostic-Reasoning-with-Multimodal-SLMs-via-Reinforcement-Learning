 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man complaining of chest tightness, shortness of
 breath, and lower extremity edema.  Is this CHF?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous examinations described as this patient showed development of
 pulmonary edema in the setting of probable pulmonary hypertension and moderate
 cardiomegaly in ___.  I am not convinced that the prior chest
 radiographs are properly attributed, and they may not belong to this patient.
 
 Current study shows new marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm associated
 with moderately severe atelectasis at the left lung base and severe distention
 of the stomach with air and fluid.  Left upper lung and entire right lung are
 clear.  Heart is not enlarged, and there is no abnormality involving
 pulmonary, mediastinal or hilar vasculature.  There is no evidence of
 congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or bronchospasm.
