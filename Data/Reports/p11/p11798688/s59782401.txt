                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with oxygen dependent COPD,
 history of MAC and prostate cancer, currently with shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Extensive fibrotic changes, pleural
 plaques and pleural calcifications in conjunction with upper zone loss of
 volume is re-demonstrated.  Within the limitations of the chest radiograph for
 assessment of patient with co-existing multiple abnormalities, there is no
 evidence of interval development of acute process.  If clinically warranted,
 correlation with chest CT is recommended.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax seen.
