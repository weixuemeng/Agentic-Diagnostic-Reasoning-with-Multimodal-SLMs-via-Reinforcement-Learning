 INDICATION:  Severe COPD and left apical pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs from ___.  CT-Chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  The lungs are still markedly
 hyperexpanded with biapical consolidation which is overall unchanged in
 appearance from ___.  Using ___ as a baseline, the right
 apical consolidation is chronic, but the left upper lobe consolidation
 appeared on ___, subsequently improved, and has now recurred. 
 Internal luciencies are from bronchiectasis, demonstrated on CT of ___.  There is no new opacity.
 
 Numerous pleural plaques are unchanged and consistent with asbestos exposure.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left apical consolidation has not improved from ___.  This
 relatively isolated, changing area has a treatment history suggesting
 recurrent infection.
