                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Again there are
 extensive fibrotic changes bilaterally, worse in the upper lungs but also seen
 in the mid and lower lungs.  Again there is superior retraction of the hila
 and bilateral pleural plaques seen, left greater than right.  The previously
 seen right base consolidation has improved in the interval.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes, as above without definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
