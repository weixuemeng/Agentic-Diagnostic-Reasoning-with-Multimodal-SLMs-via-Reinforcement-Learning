                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD and old lung nodules representing
 possible embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.  Also
 compared to the prior CT from ___.
 
 There is again seen hyperexpansion and pleural-based calcified densities
 bilaterally consistent with patient's known asbestos exposure.  There is
 scarring within the lung apices, which appear more prominent within the left
 upper lobe.  No definite consolidation is identified.  Heart size is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  More confluent opacity in the left upper lobe since prior.
 
 2.  Pleural plaques and hyperexpansion compatible with patient's known
 asbestos exposure.
