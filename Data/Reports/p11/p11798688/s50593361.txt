                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and multiple chest radiographs
 dating back to ___.
 
 Recently described acute parenchymal opacities in the left apex superimposed
 on chronic lung disease have partially cleared, but there is now a suggestion
 of a cystic or cavitary process in this region.  Given the extensive bullous
 emphysema in this region, it is uncertain whether this represents a localized
 bulla or a true cavity.  A more central area of increased opacity within this
 region could potentially represent a mycetoma.  
 
 Bilateral upper lobe pleural and parenchymal scarring are otherwise similar
 when compared to earlier chest radiographs. These findings are accompanied by
 chronic elevation of the hila and associated architectural distortion and
 traction bronchiectasis.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are suggestive
 of prior asbestos exposure.  Lung volumes are increased in keeping with COPD. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Left apical consolidation has slightly decreased, with newly visible
 underlying cystic or cavitary abnormality in this region. This could represent
 an infected bulla, cavitary infection (semi-invasive Aspergillus,
 tuberculosis) or cavitary lung neoplasm.  
 
 Consider a chest CT for more complete evaluation of this region, particularly
 given the history of worsening symptoms despite treatment.
 
 Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 3:10 p.m. at the time of discovery.
