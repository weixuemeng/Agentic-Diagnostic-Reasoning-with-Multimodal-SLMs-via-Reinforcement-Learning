 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low, but the only discrete area of atelectasis is at
 the left base and it is improving.  Left basal pleural drainage tube still in
 place.  There is probably a small left pleural effusion but no appreciable
 left pneumothorax.  Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes, probably
 top-normal.  Right lung clear.
