  1. Endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid thoracic trachea, nasogastric
  tube terminating in the stomach, pulmonary artery catheter terminating in the
  proximal right pulmonary artery, and bilateral chest tubes, all in appropriate
  position.
  2. Low lung volumes, with prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
  bronchovascular crowding. No focal consolidation or large pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p AVR  // position of lines and tubes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had interval median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement.
 Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. ET tube terminates at the level the
 clavicles. The Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the main pulmonary artery. A
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Mediastinal drains and a left
 chest tube are in place. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. New
 perihilar interstitial opacities are most likely due to gravitational
 pulmonary edema. Increased retrocardiac opacification at the left base is most
 likely due to atelectasis. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post aortic valve replacement with expected postoperative findings,
 including mild pulmonary edema and mild left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
