                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New seizure, hypoglycemia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes bilaterally with crowding of the vasculature in
 the lung bases.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is seen.  Pleural surfaces are
 normal without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is mild to
 moderately enlarged, however, is likely accentuated by patient positioning,
 low lung volumes, and AP technique.  Mediastinal contour and hila are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
