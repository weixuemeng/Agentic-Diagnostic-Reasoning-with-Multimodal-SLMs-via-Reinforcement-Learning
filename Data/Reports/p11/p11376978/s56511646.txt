  1. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions
  2. Left lower lobe opacity is likely combination of pleural fluid and
  atelectasis.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
  3. Enteric feeding tube tip at level of gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend
  advancing 15 cm for better positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachycardia assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  Lower lobe
 opacity is noted.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 Aortic arch calcifications are present.  A right porta cath tip is in the
 right atrium.  An enteric feeding tube tip is at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions
 2.  Lower lobe opacity is likely combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 3.  Enteric feeding tube tip at level of gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend
 advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
