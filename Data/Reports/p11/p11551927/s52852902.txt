                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest, portable semi upright.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position following re-intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___ at 5:55.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A series of two radiographs are provided from 2:15 and 2:24 am.  In the
 interval, the endotracheal tube was advanced.  In the later radiograph, the
 endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned 3.2 cm above the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous line terminates in the right atrium.  An
 orogastric tube traverses the esophagus, into the stomach, and terminates
 inferiorly out of the field of view.
 
 There are unchanged bilateral pleural effusions.  Aeration of the right lung
 has improved, which may reflect more upright positioning.  Low lung volumes
 cause crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Bilateral lower lobe airspace
 opacities are unchanged and may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
 2. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with improved aeration of right lung
 which may be secondary to more upright positioning.
 3. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis but aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
