                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute pancreatitis // interval progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved
 slightly over the interval.  Stable moderate pulmonary edema with persistent
 pulmonary vascular engorgement. Interval increase in density of left upper
 lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Endotracheal tube ends 5.4 cm from the carina. Right-sided
 internal jugular central venous line ends in the proximal right atrium. 
 Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and of the field of view.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase in density of left upper lobe opacity is concerning for
 pneumonia.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis has improved slightly over the interval.  Stable
 moderate pulmonary edema with persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement.
