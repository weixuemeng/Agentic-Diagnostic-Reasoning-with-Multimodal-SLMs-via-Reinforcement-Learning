                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dizziness and shortness of breath.  New left
 bundle-branch block.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Two nodular
 opacities are identified, one in each of the lower lobes on the frontal view,
 however, they are not clearly delineated on the lateral.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 suggesting either trace effusion or perhaps atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacities, one projecting over each of the lung bases for
 which repeat exam is suggested to evaluate if they persist.
