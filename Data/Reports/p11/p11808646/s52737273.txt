                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided gas is seen with distal aspect of the catheter seen to
 likely be within the azygos vein, not within the SVC.  On the lateral view,
 the catheter takes a posterior course and the tip of the catheter appears to
 en face on the frontal view.  There is mild left basilar atelectasis.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  Trace blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles is likely due to trace pleural effusions.  A 3-mm right
 middle lobe pulmonary nodule noted on prior CT is not well appreciated on this
 less sensitive study.
 
 Surgical clips are noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The left Port-A-Cath has migrated with the tip now terminating in
 the azygos vein, in appropriate position.  This finding was relayed to the
 Emergency Department by urgent wet reading.  Mild left basilar atelectasis and
 possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
