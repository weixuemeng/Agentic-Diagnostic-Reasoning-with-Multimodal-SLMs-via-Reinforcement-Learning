 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NHL and new onset pleuritic chest pain. 
 // r/o pneumonia, confirm placement of pheresis catheter and port.      r/o
 pneumonia, confirm placement of pheresis catheter and po
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided central catheter extends to the mid SVC.  The Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the lower SVC.  There is suggestion of mild opacification in the
 retrocardiac region, most likely reflecting atelectasis. In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
