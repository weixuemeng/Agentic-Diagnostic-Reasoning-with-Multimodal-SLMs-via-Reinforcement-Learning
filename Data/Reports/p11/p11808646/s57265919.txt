                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Lymphoma with indwelling port presenting with weakness and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in the azygos as seen on the prior radiograph. 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lower lobe is similar compared
 to the prior study and reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Clips from prior cholecystectomy
 are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant, and an additional surgical clip
 is seen in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Port-A-Cath tip remains within the azygos vein.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
