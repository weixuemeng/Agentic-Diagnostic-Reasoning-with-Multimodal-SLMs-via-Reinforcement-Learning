                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, shortness of breath, hypoxia, prostate
 cancer with metastases, recent endoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG and left upper lobectomy
 with multiple clips noted in the left hemithorax. The heart size remains
 within normal limits. The aorta is diffusely calcified. The mediastinal
 contour is unchanged. New mild pulmonary edema is demonstrated. In addition, a
 more focal opacity within the right upper lobe may reflect an area of
 developing infection.  There may be a small left pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Prior
 left thoracotomy changes are again noted with resection of several left-sided
 ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and possible small left pleural effusion. More focal
 opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect an area developing infection. 
 Continue followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
