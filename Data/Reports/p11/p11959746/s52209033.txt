  Mild interstitial edema, trace bilateral pleural effusions, and mild
  cardiomegaly all consistent with volume overload.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:38 AM
  1. Prominent interstitial markings which could reflect underlying chronic
  interstitial lung disease versus pulmonary edema. Prior CT from ___

 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominent interstitial markings are identified compatible with pulmonary edema
 with fluid within the fissures.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 Biapical scarring is again noted.  Known pulmonary nodules seen on the prior
 CT is not clearly identified on this study.  Trace pleural effusions are
 noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild interstitial edema, trace bilateral pleural effusions, and mild
