 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 There is slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles which
 may be due to atelectasis or trace pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  Bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are partially
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD.  Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be
 due to atelectasis but trace pleural effusions are not excluded. No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
