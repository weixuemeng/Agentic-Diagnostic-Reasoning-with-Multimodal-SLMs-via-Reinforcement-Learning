                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker projects leads into the right atrium and ventricle. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged. Central pulmonary vascular prominence appears minimally changed,
 though, in combination with lower lung volumes, likely represents overall
 improvement. There is no longer any appreciable edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. A previously seen a
 very large hiatal hernia is not easily seen on the current study, due to lack
 of intraluminal gas.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  No overt edema.
