                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Correction:  The pacemaker projects leads into the RIGHT atrium and
 ventricle.

  The patient's chin obscures the right lung apex. There is stable mild
  cardiomegaly. There is mild pulmonary edema. A large hiatal hernia is again
  present. Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis although
  superimposed consolidation is possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker projecting leads into the left atrium and ventricle is
 unchanged in position and orientation.  The heart size is top-normal.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The right lung apex is obscured
 by the patient's chin.  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema are present.  A large hiatal hernia is unchanged.  A small
 left pleural effusion is new.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Large hiatal hernia.
