                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Throat pain status post esophageal dilatation, please evaluate
 for pneumonia or pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  There is a moderate to marked enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Pacemaker leads positioned in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Bilateral low lung volumes.  Obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm in combination with retrocardiac opacity may suggest atelectasis
 in combination with pleural effusion, however, opacification persists on
 lateral views raising concern for pneumonia.  Streaky atelectasis identified
 in the right lower lung.  No pneumomediastinum evident.  Extensive multilevel
 degenerative changes with anterior osteophyte formation as well as
 degenerative changes at the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent combination of atelectasis and
 effusion; however, underlying consolidation due to aspiration or pneumonia may
 be present and is of concern.  
 
 2.  No pneumomediastinum.
 
 3.  Moderate to marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without prior for
 comparison, may be due to cardiomyopathy and/or pericardial effusion.
