                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure with large pericardial effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph.___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette size has increased in size
 compared to the previous exam and is concerning for increasing pericardial
 effusion. A large hiatal hernia is again seen. The lung volumes are low with
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are degenerative changes noted in both
 glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints with narrowed acromiohumeral
 intervals suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle remains in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which has increased in size,
 concerning for increasing pericardial effusion.  Probable small pericardial
 effusions and bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
