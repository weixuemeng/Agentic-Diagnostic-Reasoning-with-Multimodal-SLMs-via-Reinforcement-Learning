 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well expanded lungs.
 There is a thin-walled area of increased emphysematous changes at the left
 lung base consistent with what was previously described.  If this area is
 clinically concerning, could consider a high-resolution CT scan of the chest
 to look for possible interstitial changes.  There is no evidence of acute
 cardiac or pulmonary process.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
