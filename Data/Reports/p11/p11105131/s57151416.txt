                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia in mid
 ___ with consolidations in the right mid lobe, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 besides ___ available for comparison.
 
 The PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates normal heart size and
 mediastinal silhouette.  Lungs are essentially clear with no appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal scarring in the right middle
 lobe/lingula is unchanged since the prior study.  If the most recent study
 with pneumonia demonstrated becomes available, addendum regarding the dynamic
 changes will be gladly added.
