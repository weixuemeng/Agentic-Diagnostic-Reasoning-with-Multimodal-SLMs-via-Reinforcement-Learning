                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 549
 
 CLINIC INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with sepsis, ARDS versus pneumonia,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 549 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the right
 atrium.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  Biliary stent in place.  Low lung volumes. There has been
 no significant interval change in the patchy airspace consolidation in the
 periphery of the right upper lung and perihilar region concerning for
 pneumonia.  In addition, persistent retrocardiac opacity is seen with
 associated small left effusion which could reflect a partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration is also possible.  Clinical
 correlation is advised. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  
 Scattered air in non-distended loops of predominantly small bowel.  No
 pneumothorax.
