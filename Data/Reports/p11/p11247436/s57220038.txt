                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position
 including nasogastric tube coiled within a hiatal hernia.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multifocal
 pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated in the right mid and both lower
 lungs, which may reflect a combination of multifocal atelectasis and
 infectious consolidation.  Overall, this has slightly worsened in the
 interval.  Small pleural effusions are also noted.
