 COMPARISON:  Studies dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in

 right internal jugular vascular catheter with tip overlying the region of the
 body of the right atrium.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Lung volumes remain low.  Worsening multifocal pulmonary
 opacities, particularly within the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, but
 some improved aeration within the right lower lobe as compared to the prior
 study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged on the left and
 minimally improved on the right.
