                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sepsis status post pulling central line 2
 cm.  Please evaluate for line placement and ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to same-day radiograph from time ___ and time
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates right internal jugular
 venous catheter which has been pulled back 2 cm and now terminates at or just
 below the cavoatrial junction and could be pulled back 2 more centimeters to
 end in the distal SVC.  The endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the level
 of the carina.  The previously demonstrated multifocal opacifications in the
 right upper lung are concerning for pneumonia and are unchanged since the
 prior radiograph.  There is also a component of mild pulmonary edema with
 enlargement of the central pulmonary vasculature.  The cardiac size is
 unchanged since the prior study.  There has been interval removal of an NG
 tube.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Multifocal right upper lung opacification concerning for
 pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Right internal jugular venous catheter
 could be pulled back 2 cm to end in the low SVC.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ page at
