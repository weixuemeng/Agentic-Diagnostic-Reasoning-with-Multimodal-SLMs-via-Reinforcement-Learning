                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post lap chole with anemia, hypotension
 and hypoxia.  Concern for ARDS.  Evaluation for placement of OGT.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of
 an OG tube which is seen in standard position, terminating in the fundus of
 the stomach.  The previously demonstrated multifocal right upper lung
 opacification concerning for pneumonia is again seen in the axillary region of
 the right lung.  There has been interval improvement in the previously
 demonstrated pulmonary edema.  As before, there is left lower lobe atelectasis
 or collapse with an associated small left pleural effusion.  The right
 internal jugular central venous catheter and  endotracheal tube remains in
 unchanged position since prior study.  Biliary stent is again seen.  The heart
 size is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval placement of orogastric tube in standard position seen
 within the fundus of the stomach.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema. 
 Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis or collapse and persistent pneumonia
 predominantly in the axillary region of the right lung.
