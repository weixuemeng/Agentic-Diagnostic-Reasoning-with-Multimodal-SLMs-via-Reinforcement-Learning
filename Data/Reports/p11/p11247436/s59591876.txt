                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new tachypnea, wheezing.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia and volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of
 right internal jugular venous line.  There are persistent low lung volumes
 with bibasilar atelectasis and unchanged bilateral multifocal opacifications
 and evidence of unchanged pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 persist with some bibasilar atelectasis and associated volume loss.  The heart
 size is unchanged and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Persistent multifocal opacities and pulmonary edema with
 unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 significant change since the prior study.
