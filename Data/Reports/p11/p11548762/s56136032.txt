                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M ___, PMH HTN, CKD IV, BPH, osteoporosis, who presented to
 ___ with sudden onset of chest pain, SOB shortly requiring bipap, and
 who was transferred to ___ for further management, found to have pulmonary
 edema, EKG ischemic changes, and elevation in troponin concerning for ACS and
 new onset CHF.  // ?pulmonary edema vs pneumonia  ?pulmonary edema vs
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar
 opacification is consistent with pleural effusions and underlying compressive
 atelectasis.
 Given the extensive chest findings, it would be very difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
