  edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis, with right upper lobe collapse and ipsilateral
  tracheal deviation.  No focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob and cyanosis  // pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None provided.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left.  No focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  There is moderate central
 vascular congestion without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis, as well as volume loss in the right upper lobe with ipsilateral
 tracheal deviation, consistent with prior right upper lobe VATS wedge
 resection.  Mediastinal silhouette is widened, owing to an unfolded descending
 thoracic aorta.  There is heavy calcification of the ascending aorta and
 aortic knob.  Heart size is likely enlarged, though cannot be accurately
 assessed in the presence of bilateral effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 3. Right upper lobe atelectasis with ipsilateral tracheal deviation consistent
 with prior right upper lobe VATS wedge resection.  Moderate bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 4. Likely moderate cardiomegaly, though heart size cannot be completely
 assessed in the presence of bilateral effusions.
