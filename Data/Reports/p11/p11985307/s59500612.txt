                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the carina, approaching the right
 mainstem bronchus.  Enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm,
 through the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are
 seen within the aorta.  Mild pulmonary edema is present with perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the right.  Hazy opacity in the right mid lung field and
 right lung base could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Chronic deformities of the proximal humeri are re-
 demonstrated with absence of the humeral heads.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip at the level of the carina, approaching the right
 mainstem bronchus, and should be withdrawn by approximately 4 cm.
 2. Enteric tube in standard position.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the
 right.
 4. Hazy right basilar and mid lung field opacity could reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.
