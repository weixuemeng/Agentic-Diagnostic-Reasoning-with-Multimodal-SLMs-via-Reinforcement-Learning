                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with intermittent chest pain and left neck and
 arm pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is likely secondary to pleural thickening, as
 seen on prior CT.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with rightward
 shift of the trachea secondary to enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, as seen
 previously.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
