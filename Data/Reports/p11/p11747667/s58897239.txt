                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is likely top-normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
 Streaky linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis with trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No focal
 consolidation identified.
