                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and decreased breath sounds at left base.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No convincing evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
 
 There is a slight impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea. 
 This raises the possibility of thyroid enlargement.
