                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ chest radiographs and ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain moderately enlarged, and
 underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy as detected on the prior chest CT can
 not be excluded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Chronic
 interstitial abnormality within the periphery of both lungs likely reflects
 UIP.  Assessment for pleural effusion is limited, but no large pleural
 effusion is detected.  No pneumothorax is noted.  There is likely mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement on a background of chronic interstitial
 lung disease previously characterized as UIP.
