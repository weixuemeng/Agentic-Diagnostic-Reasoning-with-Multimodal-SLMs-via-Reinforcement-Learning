                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA head and neck ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Severe cardiomegaly is present.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  A focal hazy opacity is
 seen within the right apex  not clearly visualized on the previous CTA of the
 head and neck, potentially an area of infection but is nonspecific. No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.  Clips are seen in the right axilla. 
 Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2. Nonspecific area of focal opacification in the right apex.  This could
 reflect an area of infection, though infarction cannot be completely excluded.
 If there is high concern for pulmonary embolism, chest CTA is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):    If there is high concern for pulmonary embolism, chest
 CTA is recommended.
