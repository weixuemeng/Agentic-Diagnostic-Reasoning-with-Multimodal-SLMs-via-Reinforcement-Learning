                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and cough  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable with the cardiac silhouette
 enlarged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity may be due to vascular structures, but consolidation due to pneumonia
 is not entirely excluded.  Partially imaged cervical hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent cardiomegaly.
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity on the lateral view may be due to overlapping
 vascular structures but consolidation due to pneumonia is not entirely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
