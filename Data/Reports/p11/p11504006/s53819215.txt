                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // r/o infection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Surgical hardware is
 noted in the cervical spine. A right chest wall Port-A-Cath is seen with its
 tip in the SVC. Cardiomegaly is again noted with midline sternotomy wires.
 Lung volumes are low. Motion artifact limits evaluation of lateral projection.
 Allowing for this there is no overt sign of pneumonia or edema. No large
 effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable. Hilar congestion is noted. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with mild congestion. Limited exam due to low lung volumes and
 motion artifact.
