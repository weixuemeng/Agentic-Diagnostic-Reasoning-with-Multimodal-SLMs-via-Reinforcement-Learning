 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after chest tube removal.  Evaluate possible

 Patient has been extubated and overall lung volumes are stable, left lower
 lobe atelectasis has worsened.  Small left pleural effusion is stable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Previous mediastinal widening has improved, largely due
 to decrease in mediastinal venous engorgements.  Vascular catheter projecting
 over the upper chest follows a confusing course.  It could be subclavian line.
 It ends in the left brachiocephalic vein, as before.
