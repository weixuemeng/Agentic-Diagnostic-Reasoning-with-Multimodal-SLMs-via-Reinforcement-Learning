                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p bronch.  Eval for RLL collapse in
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the radiograph of 10:26 a.m. today, there has been interval
 re-expansion of the right lower and middle lobes.  Persistent right lower lobe
 opacity is likely due to incomplete re-expansion.  Left lower lobe collapse
 has worsened.  The mediastinum is stable since the earlier study, with
 unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
 
 No change in the positioning of the multiple support lines and tubes,
 including the right PICC, Swan-Ganz catheter, right-sided pleural drain, and
 endotracheal tube.  The NG tube has been advanced, with side-hole in the
 stomach.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval re-expansion of the right middle and lower lobes.  Persistent
 right lower lobe opacity suggests incomplete re-expansion currently.
 
 2.  Worsened left lower lobe atelectasis.
