 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall
 change.  Monitoring and support devices are stable.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Continued silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour,
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid.  The
 right hemidiaphragmatic contour remains sharp.
