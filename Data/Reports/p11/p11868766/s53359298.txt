 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been
 removed.  The right subclavian PICC line again extends to the lower SVC.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is the stable and there is no definite vascular
 congestion.  Continued retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion. 
 Mild atelectasis and possible small effusion is seen on the right.
