                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and malaise.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The tip of the left lateral
 costophrenic angle is excluded.  Nodular symmetric densities projecting over
 the bilateral lower lungs are consistent with prominent nipples shadows.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nipple shadows should not be mistaken for
 lung nodules.
