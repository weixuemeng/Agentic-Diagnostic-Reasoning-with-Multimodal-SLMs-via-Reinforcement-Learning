                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Increased work of breathing.  History of aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  The lung volumes are
 low.  There is similar elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  A mild
 interstitial process suggests pulmonary vascular congestion.  Scoliosis is
 again noted with attendant distortion of the thoracic anatomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
