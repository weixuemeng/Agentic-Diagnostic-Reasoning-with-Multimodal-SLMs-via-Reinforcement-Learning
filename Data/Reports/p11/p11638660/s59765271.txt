                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:36 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congenital encephalopathy and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower today than generally.  Greater opacification in the
 left lung could be edema or pneumonia, and should be reevaluated at a deeper
 inspiration if that is possible.  Right lung is grossly clear.  There is no
 good evidence for pleural effusion.  Heart size is indeterminate given severe
 anatomic distortion by marked scoliosis.  Right jugular infusion port ends in
 the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
