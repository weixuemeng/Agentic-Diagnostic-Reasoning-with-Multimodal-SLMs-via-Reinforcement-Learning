                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. 
 Previously described opacification in the left hemithorax has partially
 cleared with residual perihilar haziness and scattered interstitial opacities
 remaining.  This could be due to improving asymmetrical pulmonary edema or a
 resolving infection if the patient has been under antibiotic therapy.  Right
 lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
