                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lung transplant, needing medical clearance.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lumen
 right-sided large-bore catheter is seen with extending to the low SVC and into
 the proximal right atrium.  The patient is slightly rotated in position.  The
 right lung is hyperinflated.  There is biapical pleural thickening.  There is
 also patchy left upper lobe opacity, unclear of acuity given lack of priors
 for comparison, underlying infection or lesion not excluded.  There is some
 opacity along the lateral mid to lower left lung which could be scarring or
 post-operative.  Left base retrocardiac opacity is seen.  There is prominence
 in the region of the main pulmonary artery and there may be underlying
 pulmonary hypertension.  There are fibrotic changes in the left lung and
 volume loss seen including shift of the mediastinum to the left.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity seen on the lateral view is nonspecific could be due to
 underlying consolidation.  Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for
 further evaluation. If not available, or findings are changed, consider
 follow-up CT.
