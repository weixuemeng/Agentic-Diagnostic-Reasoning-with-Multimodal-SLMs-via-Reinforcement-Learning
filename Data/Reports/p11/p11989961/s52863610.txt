                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with recent fall  // please eval for intrathoracic process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Correlation is made to same day CT cervical spine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is noted.  Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is
 identified.  There is significant enlargement of the aortic arch, partially
 visualized on prior CT cervical spine.  Rounded opacity in the retrocardiac
 region potentially in part due to hiatal hernia however given significant
 aortic abnormality at the arch, it is more likely that this may represent a
 descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.
 
 Compression deformities of several lower thoracic vertebral bodies and likely
 lumbar vertebral body are age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Tortuosity and dilation of the thoracic aorta with a more
 rounded opacity in the retrocardiac region which is suspicious for a focal
 descending thoracic aneurysm.  Chest CT is suggested.
