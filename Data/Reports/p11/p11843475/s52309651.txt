 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with 3 vessel coronary disease, awaiting CABG, on
 IABP for low cardiac index. // balloon pump position?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Retrocardiac opacity is increased
 over the interval and may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. The
 endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina. The intra-aortic balloon pump
 tip ends 1.8 cm from the aortic arch and is in acceptable position. The
 nasogastric tube tip ends in the distal esophagus, with the last side port at
 the level of the carina. No pneumothorax. The pacer lead is no longer present
 on this view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Intra-aortic balloon pump tip ends 1.8 cm from the aortic arch, and is in
 acceptable position.
 
 3. Nasogastric tube tip ends in the distal esophagus, with the last side port
 at the level of the carina.
