 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in
 the appearance of the monitoring and support devices.  Continued increased
 opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region. This most likely
 represents atelectasis and possible small effusion. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
