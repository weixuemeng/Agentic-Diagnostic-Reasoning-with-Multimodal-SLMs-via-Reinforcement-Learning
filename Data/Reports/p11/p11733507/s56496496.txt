                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral pleural and diaphragmatic plaques/calcifications suggest prior
 asbestos exposure.  Additional left-sided pleural thickening is seen.  Left
 basilar atelectasis is seen.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  The aorta is calcified.  What is presumed to be a VP shunt is
 partially imaged overlying the right hemithorax.  Evidence of DISH is seen
 along the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral pleural and diaphragmatic plaques suggest prior asbestos exposure. 
 Pleural thickening is seen along the lateral left hemithorax, underlying
 mesothelioma can not be excluded on this study.  If there is concern for such,
 chest CT is more sensitive.
