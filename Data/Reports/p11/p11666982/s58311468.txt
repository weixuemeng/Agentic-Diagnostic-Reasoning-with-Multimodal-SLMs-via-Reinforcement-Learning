                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated blood sugar.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcification along the arch.  In the lateral right upper
 lobe, there is a small calcified granuloma or perhaps a bone island along the
 course of the overlying right anterolateral fourth rib.  A small band-like
 opacity in the lingula is consistent with minor atelectasis.  The lung field
 appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Moderate anterior osteophytes are noted along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
