                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with peritonitis  // free air?           .  Review
 of OMR indicates history of gallbladder cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right-sided
 infusion port, with the tip terminating in the upper right atrium.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Cardio mediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  Suspect mild cardiomegaly, with a calcified tortuous
 aorta.  There is bilateral hilar prominence.   Possible mild peribronchial
 cuffing is noted and the minor fissure is slightly thickened.  There is mild
 prominence of interstitial markings at both bases.  There is patchy opacity at
 both lung bases medially.   There is no definite pleural effusion.
 
 No pneumothorax or obvious subdiaphragmatic air detected.  Right upper
 quadrant surgical clips noted.
 
 Previously described (CT) described small pulmonary nodules that are not well
 depicted radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is probably unchanged.
 
 Mild prominence of interstitial markings and minimal patchy opacity at both
 lung bases, of indeterminate acuity.  This could reflect chronic changes, mild
 superimposed asymmetric CHF, or an early inflammatory process.
 
 No gross free air detected beneath the diaphragm.
 
 (Subsequent abdominal CT identified trace pneumoperitoneum -- please see
 separate report of that study.)
