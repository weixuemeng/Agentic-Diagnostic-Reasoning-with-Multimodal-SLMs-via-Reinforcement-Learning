                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status and cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  An irregular
 consolidation is again noted in the left upper lobe, similar to slightly more
 conspicuous from prior exam.  The lungs are hyperinflated with widened AP
 diameter of the chest, possibly reflecting COPD.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  No signs of CHF.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic
 knob noted.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Poorly-defined opacity in the left upper lobe, for which nonemergent chest
 CT is recommended to further assess.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly without signs of failure.
 3.  Hyperinflated lungs, which could be reflective of underlying COPD.
