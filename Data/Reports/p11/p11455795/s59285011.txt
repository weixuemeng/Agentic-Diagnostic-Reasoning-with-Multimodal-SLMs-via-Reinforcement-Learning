                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.2 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm,
 side port at the level of the GE junction.  Suggest advancement so that it is
 well within the stomach.  There is right basilar opacity with elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm, worrisome for partial right lower lobe collapse. 
 Underlying infection or aspiration may also be present.  It is difficult to
 exclude trace right pleural effusion.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube with
 side port at the level of the GE junction.  Recommend advancement so that it
 is well within the stomach.  
 
 Right basilar opacity with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, general
 haziness of the right lung suggests volume loss/at least right lower lobe
 partial collapse, underlying infection or aspiration is not excluded.
