                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung volumes
 accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 The costophrenic angles are blunted.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  There is no new abnormal cardiac and mediastinal contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable cardiomegaly.  Presence of small pleural effusions is difficult to
 discern without a lateral projection.
