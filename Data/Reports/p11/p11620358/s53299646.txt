                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and weight gain.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged with a lobular contour of the right heart border which
 can be accounted for by prominent mediastinal fat seen on prior chest CT. 
 Osseous structures demonstrate no acute osseous abnormality.  Accentuated
 lower thoracic kyphosis is seen due to mild anterior vertebral body height
 loss.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
