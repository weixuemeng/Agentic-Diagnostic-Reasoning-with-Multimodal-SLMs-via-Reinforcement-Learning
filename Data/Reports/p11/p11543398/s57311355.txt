                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with ureteral stent and hypotension  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dated back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lungs though poorly assessed due to underpenetration.  A retrocardiac
 opacity on the lateral projection raises potential concern for an early left
 lower lobe pneumonia.  Otherwise lungs appear clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There may be mild hilar congestion though there is no frank
 edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Previously noted left IJ
 central venous catheter is been removed.  Bony structures are intact.  Chronic
 rib deformities again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity, question early left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2. Possible mild hilar congestion.
