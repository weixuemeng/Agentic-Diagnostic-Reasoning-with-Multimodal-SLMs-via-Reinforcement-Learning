                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 04:58.  CT thoracic spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is moderate to severely enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contour remains widened superiorly, which based on the prior CT of the
 thoracic spine appears attributable to mediastinal fat and vascular
 structures.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Streaky opacities
 within the lung bases, more so on the left ,could reflect areas of atelectasis
 though infection is difficult to exclude.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple old rib fractures are re- demonstrated
 bilaterally.  Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are also
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar patchy opacities, possibly
 reflecting atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.
