                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  PNA, consolidation, volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are increasing bilateral pulmonary opacities with relative sparing of
 the left apex, which is partially obscured by an overlying tube. There is no
 pneumothorax. There is widening of the pleural space bilaterally and blunting
 of the costophrenic sulci most likely representing pleural fluid. The heart
 appears enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing bilateral pulmonary opacities most likely due to edema.  Evidence
 of small pleural effusions.  Underlying pneumonia is also possible and
 clinical correlation is recommended.
