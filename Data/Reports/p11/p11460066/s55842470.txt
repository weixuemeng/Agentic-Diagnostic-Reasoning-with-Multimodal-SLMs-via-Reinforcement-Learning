 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L VATS pericardial window.  // R/O PTX post
 CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, there has been
 interval removal of left-sided chest tube.  A small left basilar pneumothorax
 persists.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis have
 increased.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent, small, left basilar pneumothorax.
 Substantially increased subcutaneous emphysema tracking along the lateral left
 chest wall into the neck may have happened at the time of chest tube removal,
 but raises the possibility of a connection between the pleural space in
 subcutaneous tissues.  Attention on follow-up.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 5:36 PM, approximately 20
