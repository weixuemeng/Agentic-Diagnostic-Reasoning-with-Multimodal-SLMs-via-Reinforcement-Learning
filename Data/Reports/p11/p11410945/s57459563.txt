                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rheumatoid arthritis on treatment, now with fever and possible
 pericarditis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms is again
 consistent with some chronic pulmonary disease.
