                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild vascular
 engorgement.  Patchy right base opacity may relate to overlap of structures
 although a small consolidation due to infection is not excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Subtle right base
 opacity may represent overlap of vascular structures; however, a small
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
