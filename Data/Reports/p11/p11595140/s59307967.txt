                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Apparently new bibasilar opacities could reflect
 crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes, but
 focal aspiration or early pneumonia is difficult to exclude radiographically,
 and followup radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful in this
 regard if warranted clinically.
