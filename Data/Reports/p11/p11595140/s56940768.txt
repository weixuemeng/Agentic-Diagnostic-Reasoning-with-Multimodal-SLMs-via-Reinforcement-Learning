                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Reference is made to chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Slight increase in opacity above the posterior left hemidiaphragm
 on the lateral view may be artifactual given there appears to be external
 artifact coursing over the image of this location; however, an underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  No evidence of focal consolidation is seen
 elsewhere.  Prominence of the right hilum, is increased since the prior chest
 radiographs from ___; however, similar compared to CT from ___, in
 this patient where underlying right hilar lymphadenopathy was seen on recent
 prior CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
