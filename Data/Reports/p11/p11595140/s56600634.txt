                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic endocrine tumor presenting with epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Left PICC terminates in the upper
 SVC.  Heart size is stable.  Prominent bilateral hila, right greater than
 left, are consistent with known hilar lymphadenopathy.  Increased prominence
 of the central bronchovascular markings may be due to low lung volumes. 
 Bibasilar streaky opacities are most consistent with atelectasis.
 Emphysematous changes are again noted.  No substantial pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar appearance of right greater than left hilar lymphadenopathy.  Low lung
 volumes exaggerate bronchovascular markings.
