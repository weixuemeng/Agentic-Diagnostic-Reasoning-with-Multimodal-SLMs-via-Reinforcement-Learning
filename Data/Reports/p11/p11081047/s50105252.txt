                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dementia and new onset of delirium and
 elevated white count.  // Worsening venous congestion? Worsening bibasilar
 patchy opacities?     Worsening venous congestion? Worsening bibasilar patchy
 opac
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___.  The patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacification, with silhouetting of
 the hemidiaphragm on the left, is consistent with atelectasis and left pleural
 effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of
 superimposed basilar pneumonia could certainly be considered.
