                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of latent TB and bronchiectasis.  Now with dyspnea on
 exertion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___, and CT
 chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Redemonstrated are persistent streaky opacities
 within the right lower lobe, likely chronic and and due to scarring versus
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Redemonstrated is a small,
 calcified granuloma within the right upper lobe, stable in appearance.  A
 calcified right axillary lymph node is noted at the periphery of the film. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Chronic right lower lobe opacities, unchanged from prior examinations, and
 most compatible with scarring versus atelectasis.  
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ she to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 16:50
