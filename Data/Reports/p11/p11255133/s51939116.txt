                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman from ___ and history of latent TB, now with
 hemoptysis.  Please evaluate for mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT of the torso.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the right lower lobe, there is increased parenchymal
 opacification which correlates to the opacities seen on the CT from ___. 
 This could represent recurrent pneumonia vs. scarring from a prior infection. 
 This is unlikely related to tuberculosis given its location and appearance. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  The left lung is essentially clear.
