                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with EtOH/HCC cirrhosis, beta blocker toxicity,
 now with fever 100.___F  // pna/pulmonary edema/asperation     pna/pulmonary
 edema/asperation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains
 within upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged, with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bibasilar opacification, slightly more prominent on the left, is
 consistent with pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.  ,
