                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new fevers. Has been hospitalized.  //
 PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Pulmonary hila appear prominent bilaterally.  Interval decrease in size of
 small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated
 improving bibasilar atelectasis.  . There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight improvement in small pleural effusions and accompanying basilar
 atelectasis.  No new foci of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.
 
 Prominent hilar contours may reflect prominent pulmonary vascularity or hilar
 lymphadenopathy in this patient with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma.
 
 Recommendation: If warranted clinically, contrast-enhanced chest CT could be
 obtained for further characterization of the hilar structures.
