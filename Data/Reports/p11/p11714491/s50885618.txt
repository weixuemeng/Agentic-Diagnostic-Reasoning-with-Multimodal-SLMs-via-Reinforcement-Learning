                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETOH cirrhosis, HCC presenting with
 hepatic encephalopathy  // evidence of new infiltrates/pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion, without
 evidence of frank pulmonary edema.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis, and may be responsible for leftward mediastinal shift.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema.
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
