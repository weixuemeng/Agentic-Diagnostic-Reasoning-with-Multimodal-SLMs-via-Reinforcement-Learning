                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of central line placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from the same day performed at 7:41 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided IJ with the tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  There is an ET tube which is in appropriate
 position above the carina.  There is an enteric tube which terminates
 appropriately below the diaphragm. Patchy bilateral airspace opacities, left
 greater than right, appear similar-to-slightly improved compared to the prior
 exam.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax; however, please
 note that the right costophrenic angle is not visualized on this exam.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  The heart size is normal.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right-sided IJ terminates at the mid SVC.
