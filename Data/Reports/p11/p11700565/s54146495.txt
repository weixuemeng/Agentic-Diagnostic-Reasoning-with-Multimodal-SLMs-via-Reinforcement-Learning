                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Intubated.  Confirm endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm
 above the carina.  A nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  There is bilateral
 patchy airspace opacity, greater in the left lung than in the right lung,
 which may represent aspiration or infection.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The heart size is
 normal.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  Bilateral
 patchy, left greater than right, airspace consolidation, in the bilateral
 lower lobes, likely represents aspiration and/or infection.
