                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx multiple ICHs/difficult history, c/f mild
 change in neuro status, acute diffuse ABD pain with R shoulder pain, R leg
 swelling  // Eval for ICH, acute ABD pathology, R DVT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  There is partial obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm with left base consolidation seen.  Subtle opacity at
 the right costophrenic angle on the frontal view may be due to overlying soft
 tissue versus additional site of consolidation.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen but it would be difficult to exclude a trace left pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia and/or aspiration. 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the right costophrenic angle may be due to
 overlying soft tissue, additional site of consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Recommend followup to resolution.
