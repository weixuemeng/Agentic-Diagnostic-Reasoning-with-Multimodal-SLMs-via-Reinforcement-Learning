                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach; its distal course is not
 delineated.  A right internal jugular venous introducer catheter terminates in
 the mid superior vena cava.  The lung volumes are low with streaky opacities
 at the lung bases suggesting minor atelectasis.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A very
 small pleural effusion is present on the left side only.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.
