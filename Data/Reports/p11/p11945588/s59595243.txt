 Some of the apparent increase in heart size is due to differences in patient
 positioning. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate.  Low lung volumes exaggerate
 mild pulmonary edema, but increase in pulmonary vascular congestion in the

 may be small to moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Left PIC line ends in the
 upper SVC.
