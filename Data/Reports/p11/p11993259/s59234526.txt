                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:08 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Orthopnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinum is substantially widened,
 particularly in the right paratracheal station.  This could be due to vascular
 engorgement but adenopathy would have the same appearance.  Right lung is
 grossly clear.  There is a small left pleural effusion and poor aeration of
 the left lung base medially.  Conventional radiographs strongly recommended to
 look for consolidation in the left lung, and to determine what could be a
 bronchial stent in the left main bronchus is a real or an artifact.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m.
