 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:11 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new Dobbhoff catheter.  The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of
 the catheter projects over the distal parts of the stomach.  There is no
 evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the radiograph
 is unchanged and normal.
