                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post cardioversion, presents
 with dyspnea on exertion, crackles at the bases.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The overall heart size has not undergone any significant interval
 change.  There are, however, some pleural changes such as the less marked
 stability of minor and major interlobar fissure, as well as the mild blunting
 of the lateral pleural sinuses have regressed.  This may indicate some
 hemodynamic improvement with less wetness in the pleural spaces following
 correction of heart rhythm.  No evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates and no pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possibly mild changes in appearance of pleural spaces following
 successful cardioversion.
