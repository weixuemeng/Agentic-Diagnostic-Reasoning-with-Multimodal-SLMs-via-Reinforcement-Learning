 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, on
 amiodarone.  Study requested to rule out acute changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which could be
 caused by a small right-sided pleural effusion.  There is left base
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. No interstitial
 changes that might reflect amiodarone toxicity are noted.  There is left
 ventricular enlargement and a large left pulmonary artery is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No interstitial changes that might reflect amiodarone toxicity. However, if
 clinical concern, CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 2. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which could be caused by a small
