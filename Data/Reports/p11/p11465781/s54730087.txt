 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day at an outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  Right midlung opacity is likely secondary to atelectasis.  There is
 no large confluent consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Tortuosity of the
 descending thoracic aorta is noted.  There is compression deformity of the mid
 thoracic spine
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body could potentially be acute. 
 Clinical correlation regarding site of pain is suggested.
