                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric cancer, fatigue, increased oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 clear.  Blunting of left costophrenic angle is chronic, and likely relates to
 chronic pleural thickening.  Lungs are hyperinflated with mild emphysematous
 changes again noted at the lung apices.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 is detected, and there is no new focal consolidation.  Mild degenerative
 changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior with chronic left costophrenic angle
 blunting likely reflecting pleural thickening.  No pneumonia or metastatic
 disease identified.  Emphysema.
