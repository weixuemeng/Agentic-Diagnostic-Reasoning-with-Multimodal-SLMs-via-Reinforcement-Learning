 INDICATION:  Cough with sputum production for the past seven days, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis is present in the lung bases. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  The thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits.  The osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized with multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine as well as generalized loss of height of several mid and lower thoracic
 vertebral bodies, similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
