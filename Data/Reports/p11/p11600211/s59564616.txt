                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 REPORT:  
 
 Very little interval change from the prior study.  Bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques.  There is a provided history of asbestos exposure, although
 hemothorax or pyothorax might have similar appearance.  The underlying lung
 parenchyma shows a nodule in the right mid zone, not changed from before and
 some nonspecifically increased lung markings.  No definitive acute finding is
 seen.  As per prior report, a repeat chest CT may be useful.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 
 Chronic changes.  No definitive acute findings.
