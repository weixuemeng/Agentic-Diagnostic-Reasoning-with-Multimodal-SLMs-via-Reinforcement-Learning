                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with known asbestos
 plaques, COPD and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The bilateral pleural plaques are redemonstrated, grossly unchanged.  There
 are overall diffusely increased interstitial opacities in both lungs, mid and
 lower lobes, in particular.  The findings are not specific for interstitial
 pulmonary edema and more likely to represent infectious process or interval
 development of interstitial lung disease.  Given the history, interstitial
 lung disease would be a possibility, thus reassessment of the patient with
 chest CT is required.
