                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset tachypnea.  // STAT - assess for
 pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, there has not been an appreciable
 change in the appearance of the chest when consideration is given to
 differences in technical factors between the studies.  Widespread calcified
 pleural plaques limit sensitivity for detecting subtle lung abnormalities, and
 standard PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful for more complete
 assessment when the patient's condition permits.
