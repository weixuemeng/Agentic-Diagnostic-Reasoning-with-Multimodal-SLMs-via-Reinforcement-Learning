                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of dCHF, COPD, here with new ascites
 and ___. Also with new O2 requirement on 3L NC.  // eval for pulmonary edema,
 effusions, consolidations
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors the most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density compared to the prior study which suggests atelectasis
 however infection should be considered.  There are no large pleural effusions
 identified. Scattered pulmonary opacities are seen throughout the bilateral
 lungs which may be related to persistent edema or a chronic interstitial
 process.  No pneumothorax is identified. Pleural calcifications are seen and
 are unchanged from the most recent prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity suggesting atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate setting.  Persistent bilateral airspace opacities likely reflect
 pulmonary edema however underlying interstitial process cannot be excluded. 
 No pneumothorax.
