                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/shortness of breath, please eval for occult PNA  // ___M
 w/shortness of breath, please eval for occult PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  There 
 Right middle lobe opacity is more linear in appearance, consistent with
 atelectasis, though more confluent opacity is seen in the right lower lobe,
 consistent with pneumonia.  Nodular opacity at right lung base is probably a
 nipple shadow but may be confirmed with nipple marker radiographs.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Follow-up examination is recommended in 4 weeks
 after completion of antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution.  At that time,
 nipple markers may be placed to ensure that a nodular opacity at the right
 base is due to a nipple shadow rather than a lung nodule.
