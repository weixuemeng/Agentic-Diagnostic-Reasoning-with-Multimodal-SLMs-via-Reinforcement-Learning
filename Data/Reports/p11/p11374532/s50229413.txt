 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:55 PM
  New pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right lower lung resulting in
  a significant decrease in the loculated right pleural effusion.  Relative
  hyperlucency in this area reflects a small pneumothorax.  Dense consolidation
  in the right upper lobe has worsened.  Slight decrease in size of a left
  loculated pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis persists.  Findings
  discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 20:54 on ___ by telephone
  at the time of discovery.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, large
 partially loculated right pleural effusion has decreased in size, particularly
 in the lower right hemithorax near the catheter.  In this same region, focal
 hyperlucency likely represents a loculated pneumothorax.  Extensive right
 upper lobe consolidation has worsened in the interval.  Right mid and lower
 lung atelectasis adjacent to the loculated effusion have improved with
 residual opacity which could reflect combination of resolving atelectasis and
 reexpansion edema, although additional site of infection is possible in the
 setting of right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 Large left loculated pleural effusion and adjacent left mid and lower lung
 atelectasis are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased size of right pleural effusion following pigtail pleural
 catheter placement, with development of a small loculated pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Worsening right upper lobe pneumonia.
