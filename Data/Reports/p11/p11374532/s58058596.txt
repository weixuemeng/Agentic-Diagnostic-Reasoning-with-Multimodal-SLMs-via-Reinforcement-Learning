                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of recurrent loculated pleural
 effusions, now admitted with right upper lobe pneumonia and reaccumulation of
 fluid.  Patient is status post chest tube placement (on suction).  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Opacification of the right lung apex, a
 combination of known pneumonia and loculated pleural fluid appears increased
 since most recent prior.  A chest tube remains in place within the right mid
 lung.  Previously seen air adjacent to the chest tube site has decreased,
 likely due to improving loculated hydropneumothorax.  Previously seen
 loculated fluid within the right basilar pleural space has decreased in the
 interval.  However, within the adjacent right lower lobe, worsening
 consolidation is seen, which may be due to re-expansion pulmonary edema or
 progressiong of pneumonia.  Aeration of the left lung with a large left
 loculated pleural effusion is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged and within normal limits.  Pacemaker leads are intact and in
 standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening right upper lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Decreased size of right basilar pleural effusion after chest tube
 drainage.  Adjacent consolidation in right lower lobe may be due to
 re-expansion edema and/or pneumonia.
