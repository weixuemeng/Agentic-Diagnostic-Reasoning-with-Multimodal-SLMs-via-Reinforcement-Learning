                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of Castleman's disease, pleural effusions
 and pseudomonas pneumonia.  For evaluation.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Patient has dual-chamber pacemaker in situ.  There is some calcification of
 the thoracic aorta.
 
 There is some volume loss on the right side and there is diffuse right-sided
 airspace consolidation.  Some of this is bordered posteriorly by possible
 suture lines.  At the site of a prior right-sided chest drain, there is now a
 rounded opacity with discrete air-fluid level.  There is an increased left
 sided irregular pleural collection which is probably loculated.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Mild interval improvement of right upper lobe pneumonia.  Mild worsening of
 the left-sided effusion.  Loculated right hydropneumothorax at site of prior
 chest drain.
