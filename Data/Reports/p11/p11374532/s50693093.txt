                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The loculated bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged in extent and
 severity.  Adjacent areas of consolidation, likely reflecting atelectasis, are
 also constant.  The only improvement is slightly increase in radiolucency in
 the right lung, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The appearance of the
 left lung is unchanged.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  The left
 pectoral pacemaker and its leads show unchanged position.
