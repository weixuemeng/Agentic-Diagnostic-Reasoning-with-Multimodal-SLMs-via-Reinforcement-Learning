                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia, coronary artery disease, CHF. 
 Question heart failure, tachypneic on exam.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior studies, most recently chest radiograph from
 ___, PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior study, the moderate-sized,
 loculated right pleural effusion is slightly larger.  There is a markedly
 increased, now large loculated left pleural effusion.  Additionally, there is
 new airspace opacity in the right upper lobe .  There is no pneumothorax.  A
 left chest wall pacemaker is present with leads terminating within the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 normal.  Bilateral nephro-ureteral catheters are partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION
 1.  New right upper lobe airspace opacity is concerning for pneumonia or
 massive aspiration. Asymmetrical edema is less likely.
 
 2.  Loculated large left pleural effusion has substantially increased in size.
 
 3.  Moderate sized loculated right pleural effusion has slightly increased in
 size.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 12 p.m.
