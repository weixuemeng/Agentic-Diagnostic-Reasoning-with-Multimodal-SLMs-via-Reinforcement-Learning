                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with non-small cell lung
 cancer and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter is inserted through the left subclavian approach with its
 tip terminating at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size is slightly shifted to
 the right giving the interval development of right pleural effusion and at
 least partial atelectasis of the right lower lung.  Right perihilar
 consolidation reflecting combination of the mass and loculated effusion is
 redemonstrated.  Left lung is essentially clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval development of right pleural effusion or at least redistribution as
 compared to the prior PET-CT from ___.  The amount of effusion
 is at least moderate.  Right perihilar consolidation consistent with known
 lung cancer.  Left lung is unremarkable.
