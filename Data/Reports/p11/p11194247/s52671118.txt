                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient post-right-sided Pleurx catheter. 
 Study requested for evaluation of pneumothorax and/or position of the tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and prior chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Pleurx catheter terminates in the right basal pleura.  There has
 been interval improvement of a moderate to large right pleural effusion with
 some residual fluid still present. There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  The
 right upper lobe is now completely collapsed.  The known right upper lobe mass
 now looks more solid, this could be attributed to loculated pleural effusion
 or hemorrhage in the right upper lobe. The left lung is clear. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. A left infusion
 port tip terminates in the mid to lower SVC. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Right upper lobe collapse.
 
 3.  Change in character of known right upper lobe mass raises the possibility
 of a loculated pleural effusion or hemorrhage.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ on 11:55 AM.
