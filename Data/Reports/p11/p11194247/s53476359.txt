                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  The right-sided chest
 tube is in unchanged position.  There is continued evidence of volume loss in
 the right lung with slight interval increase in size of the small right
 pleural effusion.  Right upper lung field opacification is compatible with
 patient's known lung cancer with loculated pleural fluid noted along the apex
 and adjacent postobstructive atelectasis and possible pneumonia.  Left lung is
 clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in size of small right pleural effusion.  Persistent
 right upper lung field opacity representing the patient's known malignancy
 with loculated effusion at the apex and associated postobstructive atelectasis
 and possible pneumonia.
