                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Enlarged lacrimal glands.  Evaluate for sarcoidosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate normal cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours.  A left lower lung linear opacity likely represents
 atelectasis or fibrosis; the lungs are otherwise clear without pulmonary edema
 or focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged chest radiograph without radiographic evidence of sarcoidosis.
