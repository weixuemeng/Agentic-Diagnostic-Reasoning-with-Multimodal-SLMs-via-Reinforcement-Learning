 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the

 costophrenic angle is not seen due to overlying density; pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There is mild interstitial edema.  The right atrial pacer
 lead is positioned deep, probably at the level of the tricuspid valve or right
 ventricle; the right ventricular lead appears appropriately positioned on this
 single view, but is not completely evaluated.

 1. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. 
 2. Deep position of right atrial pacing lead, which may be at the level of the
 tricuspid valve or right ventricle.
