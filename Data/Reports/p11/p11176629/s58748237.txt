                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left pleural effusion.  Assess.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion is largely layering.  Left lung above that
 level is clear.  Right lung fully expanded and clear.  Heart size normal. 
 Presence of slight ipsilateral mediastinal shift suggests the pleural effusion
 is chronic, accompanied by an equivalent volume of atelectasis.
