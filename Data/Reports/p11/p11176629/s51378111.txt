                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic breast cancer, effusions.  Please evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is persistent.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 largely layering, overall stable to slightly improved compared to the prior
 exam.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Opacity in the right. Opacity
 overlying the mid left lung is only seen on the frontal view, with no
 correlate on the lateral view, and is likely secondary to prominence of the
 anterior chest wall soft tissue overlying the mid left lung.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable to slightly improved left-sided moderate pleural effusion
 compared to the exam from ___.
