                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable radiograph of chest.
 
 Comparisons were made with prior chest radiographs through ___ with
 the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present. Mediastinum and pulmonary vasculature are mildly
 congested, though I do not see evidence of frank pulmonary edema. Increased
 retrocardiac density and minimal right lower lung opacity suggests bi-basal
 atelectasis, left side more than right. Left pleural effusion is minimal.
