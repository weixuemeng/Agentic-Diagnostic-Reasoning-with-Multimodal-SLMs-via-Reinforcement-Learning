                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with difficult intubation, c/o a missing tooth-
 to evaluate for FB aspiration  // Rule out missing tooth - Forein body in lung
 Rule out missing tooth - Forein body in lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No opaque foreign body is appreciated.  However, on the subsequent CT scan
 that showed slightly lower in the abdomen, the missing tooth is clearly
 identified.
 Areas of increased opacification in several portions of the left lung are
 worrisome for pneumonia, which was confirmed on CT.  Poor definition of the
 right heart border is consistent with the middle lobe process identified on
 CT.
