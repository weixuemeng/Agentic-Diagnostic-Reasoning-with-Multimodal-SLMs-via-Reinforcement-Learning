                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:42 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with persistent hypoxia and AA gradient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest in the absence of recent prior chest radiographs, read
 in conjunction with the torso CT of ___.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Right lower lung is grossly clear.
 Left lower lung partially obscured by the cardiac silhouette is not
 consolidated.  Large branching opacities in the upper lungs, particularly the
 left could be a combination of mucoid impaction and large vessels.  The
 contour of the upper mediastinum was widened by extensive mediastinal fat in
 ___, but nevertheless raises concern for extensive adenopathy.  I don't think
 more definitive diagnosis is possible from conventional radiographs and _chest
 CT be repeated.
 
 ET tube in standard position.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
