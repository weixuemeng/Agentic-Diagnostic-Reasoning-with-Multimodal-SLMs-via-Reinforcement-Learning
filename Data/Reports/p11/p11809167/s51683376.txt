                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Increased
 interstitial abnormality could be due to mild pulmonary edema, although low
 lung volumes complicate this assessment.  Dual lumen central venous catheter
 terminates with its distal tip in the superior cavoatrial junction.  No
 definite pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax with unchanged
 minimal left apical pleural thickening.  The heart is top normal in size with
 tortuous aorta contour.  Coarse calcifications in the left axilla could be a
 calcified lymph node or intra-articular body within the left glenohumeral
 joint are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
