                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypoxia, question pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 17:08 p.m.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Possibility of hilar enlargement cannot be excluded.  Again
 seen are diffuse interstitial markings in both lungs.  Allowing for technical
 differences, the overall appearance is quite similar, possibly slightly
 improved.  There is some increased patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region. 
 No gross effusion, though minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles may be
 present.  Again seen is a large dense lobulated calcification adjacent to the
 left chest wall, possibly in relation to the axilla.  Surgical sutures in the
 region of the GE junction.  Asymmetric left apical pleural thickening is
 noted, better seen on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD and cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings, equivocally slightly improved
 compared with one day earlier.  Differential diagnosis includes CHF or an
 atypical interstitial infiltrate  such as an atypical pneumonic infiltrate.  
 
 3.  Slight worsening of patchy retrocardiac density, consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
