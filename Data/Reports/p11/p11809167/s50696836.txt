                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Prominence
 of interstitial markings again seen may be due to chronic lung disease with
 superimposed mild edema.  Right mid lung patchy opacity is seen which could
 relate to prominent vasculature; however, a focus of infection is not
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Amorphous calcification in the left
 axilla is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild prominence of interstitial markings may be due to mild
 interstitial edema superimposed on chronic lung changes.  Subtle focus of
 opacity in the right mid lung could be due to prominent vasculature; however,
 a focus of infection is not excluded.
