 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  Compared to the

 prominence, likely representing pulmonary edema superimposed on background of
 emphysema.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The heart remains
 enlarged.  No focal consolidations are identified.  Calcification in the left
 axilla is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema
 with no pneumonia.
