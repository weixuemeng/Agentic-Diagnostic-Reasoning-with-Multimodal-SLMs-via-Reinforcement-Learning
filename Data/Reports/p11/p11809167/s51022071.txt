                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Persistent cough for three weeks, increased weakness,
 question pneumonia or rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Previously noted
 endotracheal tube has been removed.  There is a calcification in the left
 axilla, possibly corresponding to a lymph node, unchanged.  Coarsened
 interstitial markings are increased from prior exam, which may represent
 interstitial edema, though an atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No lobar
 consolidation is seen.  There may be a tiny left pleural effusion.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours appear stable.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased prominence of interstitial lung markings suggests
 interstitial edema, though an atypical pneumonia is not excluded.  Probable
 small left pleural effusion.
