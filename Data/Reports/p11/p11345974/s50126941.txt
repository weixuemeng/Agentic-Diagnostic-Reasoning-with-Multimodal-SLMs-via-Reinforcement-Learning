                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IN O.R.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with TCA overdose with copious secretions.  // ? interval
 change      ? interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with a E study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains in good
 position.  The nasogastric tube again loops on itself so that the tip is just
 below the esophagogastric junction and pointing upward.
 Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size.  Again there
 is elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The right hemidiaphragm is less
 well seen, consistent with layering effusion and basilar atelectasis. 
 Atelectatic changes are also seen at the left base.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be very difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
