                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p bike accident on ___ with left pneumothorax,
 now found tohave increased in size on ___ (shoulder films). Recommended CXR
 to evaluate further // assess interval changes of left-sided pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray from ___, as well as shoulder
 radiographs obtained ___, and multiple examinations obtained on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multiple left-sided rib fractures as well as left clavicular
 fracture.
 
 The left-sided pneumothorax has increased in size significantly from initial
 chest x-ray obtained ___.  It now measures 2.4 cm from lung apex to apical
 chest wall.  There is no mediastinal shift. There is a stable persistent small
 left pleural effusion.
 
 In comparison to prior study, there is more optimal inspiratory effort.
 Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable
 in appearance.  There are no focal lung consolidations. There is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increase in size of the left pneumothorax in comparison to radiographs
 obtained on ___. No mediastinal shift.
 2.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone with Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ on ___ at 15:20, at the time of discovery.
