 As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring
 and support devices are constant. There is no evidence for of a pneumothorax
 of the chest tube removal yesterday.  The cardiac assisting device is in
 unchanged position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild fluid overload.

 left lateral part of a pleural effusion, previously masked in part by the left
 pectoral pacemaker, is better visualized.
