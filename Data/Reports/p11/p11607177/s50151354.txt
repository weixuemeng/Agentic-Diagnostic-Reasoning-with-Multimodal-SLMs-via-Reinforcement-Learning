                                 FINAL REPORT
 RADIOGRAPHS  
 
 HISTORY:  Asthma and congestive heart failure, presenting with worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours appear unchanged.  There is again hazy upper zone re-distribution of
 pulmonary vascularity with a mild to moderate appearance of perihilar fullness
 and interstitial changes in the mid and lower lungs, most consistent with
 mild-to-moderate congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.  Findings are fairly similar to the prior
 examination, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
