                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of cardiomyopathy, CHF, LV
 ejection fraction ___% and atrial fibrillation.  Patient is status post ICD
 implant on ___.  Check ventricular lead position as today the ventricular
 lead threshold is significantly higher.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with a similar PA and lateral chest
 examination obtained on ___.  The previously described
 cardiomegaly persists, rather unchanged.  Position of previously described
 permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position unaltered.  The pacer is
 connected to a single intracavitary electrode.  The distal terminal wire
 enforcement is well identified and appears in unchanged position as identified
 on PA and lateral chest views.  The distal point of the electrode points to
 the left and anteriorly which is indicative of the apical area of the right
 ventricle.  Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature as seen on the frontal
 view demonstrates that the previously existing perivascular haze has decreased
 indicating improvement of pulmonary venous congestion.  No new parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen, the pleural sinuses are free and no pneumothorax exists
 in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of single electrode ICD device in apical
 portion of right ventricle.  To evaluate possible positional causes that may
 explain increasing thresholds, fluoroscopic evaluation of the distal catheter
 is recommended as the static routine PA and lateral chest views cannot account
 for events during normal cardiac motion.
