                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD/ desatting  // eval for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is demonstrated as well as a medial component
 of the pneumothorax adjacent to the and left heart border. Overall size of
 pneumothorax is probably moderate given the supine positioning of the patient,
 but is difficult to quantify due to exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus from
 the study. Left chest tube remains in place.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable, with persistent cardiac enlargement and pulmonary vascular congestion
 accompanied by worsening edema.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, not
 fully quantify due to exclusion of extreme lung bases from the radiograph.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 4:49 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
