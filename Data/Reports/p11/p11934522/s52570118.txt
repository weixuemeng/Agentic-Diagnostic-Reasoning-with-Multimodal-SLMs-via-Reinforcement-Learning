                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diastolic congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension,
 status post thoracentesis of a right pleural effusion on ___, now
 with likely re-accumulation.  Evaluate for pleural effusion versus pulmonary
 edema versus infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back through ___, including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided pacemaker and associated right atrial and right
 ventricular leads are not significantly changed in position compared to the
 prior study from ___.  A moderate right pleural effusion is
 increased compared to the most recent study from ___, slightly
 smaller than the pre-thoracentesis radiographs from ___.  ___
 right lower lung compressive atelectasis is increased.  Minimal left lower
 lung atelectasis is not significantly changed.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion, unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased moderate right pleural effusion and ___ right basilar
