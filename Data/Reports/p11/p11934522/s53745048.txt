 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion, status post thoracocentesis, evaluation
 for re-accumulation of fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:19 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
 re-accumulation of right pleural fluid, with increasing atelectasis at the
 right lung bases.  The changes, however, are not very impressive.  Unchanged
 minimal left pleural effusion.  Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma
 and the borderline sized cardiac silhouette.  There is no evidence of a right
 pneumothorax.  Unchanged left apical pleural thickening.
