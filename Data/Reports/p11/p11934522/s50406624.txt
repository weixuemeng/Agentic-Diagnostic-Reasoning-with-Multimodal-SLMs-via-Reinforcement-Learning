                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with known right effusion, CHF, worsening
 oxygen saturations.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is slight interval worsening of a right layering pleural effusion. 
 A smaller left effusion is seen.  In addition, it appears that there is
 increasing cephalization of the vasculature suggestive of pulmonary venous
 hypertension, although no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart remains
 enlarged.  A dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place with the leads
 terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively.  Given the presence of the large right effusion, the
 airspace consolidation in the right mid and lower lung likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
