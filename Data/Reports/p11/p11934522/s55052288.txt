 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, questionable pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other
 complications.  The right pleural effusion that preexisted has substantially
 decreased in extent.  However, a small amount of effusion is still present at
 the lower aspects of the unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and moderate fluid
 overload.  The pectoral pacemaker position is constant.
