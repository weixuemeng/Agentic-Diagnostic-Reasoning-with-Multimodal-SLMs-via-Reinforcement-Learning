                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fatigue and for 2 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right right ventricle is again noted.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette
 size is difficult due to the presence of a large right pleural effusion, which
 has markedly increased compared to the prior study.  A small left pleural
 effusion is also minimally increased compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  Left apical pleural thickening is unchanged.  Partially
 imaged is hardware within the left proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large right and small left pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
