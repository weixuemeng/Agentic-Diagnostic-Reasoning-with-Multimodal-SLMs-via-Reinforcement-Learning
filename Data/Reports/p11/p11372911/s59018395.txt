                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent R. pleural effusion.  // s/p
 drainage ___ at OSH; eval effusion      s/p drainage ___ at OSH; eval
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion, partially fissural, is smaller following
 placement of a right basal pleural drainage tube.  Apparent decrease in size
 of the cardiac silhouette may be due to diuresis, since mediastinal veins are
 also smaller, or the decrease in juxta cardiac pleural fluid.
 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality at the lung bases could be edema or infiltrative
 lung disease. No pneumothorax.
 
 Transvenous right and left ventricular pacer leads follow their expected
 courses.
