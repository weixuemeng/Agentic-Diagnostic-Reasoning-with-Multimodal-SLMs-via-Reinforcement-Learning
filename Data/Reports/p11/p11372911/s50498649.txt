                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upgrade to BiV PPM, confirm lead placement.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 16:53 p.m.
 
 A right-sided battery pack is present.  Lead tips are seen in the expected
 location of the right atrium and along the coronary sinus.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 Again seen is a moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Pulmonary vascular plethora on the right is again noted, but
 improved.  Some increased markings on the left are also again noted, but
 likely accentuated by film technique.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung
 base.  No gross left effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post pacemaker-type device with lead tips stable compared with the
 prior film.
 
 2.  Right pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation at
 right base, unchanged.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly unchanged.
 
 4.  Previously seen CHF findings in the right upper zone have improved, but
 slightly increased interstitial markings in both upper zones remain visible.  
 
 5.  Probable bibasilar carotid artery calcification, not well evaluated on
 these films.
