 1.  A right-sided single-lead pacer remains in place with the tip terminating
 over the expected location of the right ventricle.  Small bilateral layering
 effusions, right greater than left.  Coarsening of the interstitium which is
 felt to most likely represent underlying chronic changes with interval

 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.  No
 pneumothorax.
