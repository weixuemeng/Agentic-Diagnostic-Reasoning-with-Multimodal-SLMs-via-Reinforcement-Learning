                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with severe COPD, now with rales on
 examination.  Evaluate for any CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains
 unchanged and is within normal limits.  Mild widening and elongation of the
 thoracic aorta is unaltered.  No mediastinal masses are seen.  Bilaterally,
 the lungs demonstrate a rather irregular pulmonary vascular distribution
 coinciding with multiple areas of increased translucency most marked in the
 lung bases where they coincide with low positioned and flattened diaphragms. 
 These findings are again indicative of rather advanced COPD/emphysema. 
 Comparison with the previous examination demonstrates increased local markings
 on the left lung base can be identified on comparison of the lateral views to
 involve mostly the anterior basal regions, thus representing infiltrates in
 the periphery of the upper lobe lingula.  No new pleural effusion can be
 identified as the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cardiac enlargement or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  General pulmonary findings consistent with advanced COPD as
 before.  A new hazy density in lingula area indicative of exacerbation in this
 area.  Followup examination after successful treatment is recommended in ___
 weeks.
