                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening shortness of breath for two weeks.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ CT chest.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Dilated ascending
 aorta is better appreciated on the CT chest.  Old rib fractures are
 demonstrated.  No definitive focal consolidations to suggest infectious
 process are noted.  Pleural thickening adjacent to the rib fractures can be
 appreciated on both CT and chest radiograph, grossly unchanged.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
