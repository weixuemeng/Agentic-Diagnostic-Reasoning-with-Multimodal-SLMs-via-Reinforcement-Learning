 AP CHEST 5:17 P.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with severe COPD and blood-tinged sputum.  Is
 there evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm accompanied by persistent severe
 gaseous distention of stomach and colon, developed between ___ and
 ___.  There is no lobar collapse, so the findings suggest severe
 progression of diaphragmatic eventration or development of a paralyzed or
 otherwise non-functioning left hemidiaphragm over the past year.  I see no
 pneumonia or large source of bleeding in the lung.  Pulmonary embolism is
 neither suggested nor excluded by this radiographic appearance.  Heart size is
 top normal, but there is no pulmonary edema or other evidence of cardiac
 decompensation.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
