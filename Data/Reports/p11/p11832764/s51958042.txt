                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CP  // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are somewhat low
 though allowing for this, there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or
 edema.  There is minimal basal atelectasis which is slightly improved from
 prior exam.  Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable though the
 heart size is suboptimally assessed given low lung volumes.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved though mild persistent basilar atelectasis.
