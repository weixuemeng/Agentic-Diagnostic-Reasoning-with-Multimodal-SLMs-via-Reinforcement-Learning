                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of vomiting and hypotension, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  The patient is status post CABG and median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  There are left greater than right bibasilar
 opacities which may represent atelectasis.  More conspiuous left basilar
 opacity obscures the costophrenic angle, possible effusion.   There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The imaged upper
 abdomen demonstrates multiple dilated air-filled loops of bowel concerning for
 an obstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis although infection is
 possible.  Probable small left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Multiple dilated loops of bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction. 
 Recommend CT abdomen and pelvis for further evaluation.
