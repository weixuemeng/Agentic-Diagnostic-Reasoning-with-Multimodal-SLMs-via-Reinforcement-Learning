                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided rib pain status post fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  Streaky opacities are demonstrated the lung bases. 
 There appears to be slight blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally,
 suggestive of tiny pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are moderate degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.  No displaced
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 displaced fractures are clearly visualized.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 If there is continued concern for a rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib
 series with a BB marker indicating the site of the patient's pain.
