 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with TBI s/p aggressive suctioning  // ETT tube
 positioning      ETT tube positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___:45.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements.  Esophageal
 drainage tube can be traced as far as the diaphragm then passes out of view. 
 Opacification at the right lung base is largely atelectasis but is probably
 accompanied by some pleural fluid.  More heterogeneous opacity at the left
 lung base is concerning for early pneumonia.  Heart is mildly enlarged but
 there is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
