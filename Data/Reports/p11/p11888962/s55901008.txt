                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with left distal femoral fracture  // Pre-operative
 clearance
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the frontal, the lungs are clear. However, on the lateral view there is
 increased opacity projecting in the subcarinal region, new since previous
 exam. This persists on multiple lateral views. While this may be due to
 superimposed shadows from hilar vasculature, left atrium and tortuous aorta,
 nonurgent chest CT is suggested to further evaluate. There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is noted as well as a prosthetic aortic valve.
 Median sternotomy wires are noted. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Mild cardiomegaly. Increased subcarinal
 opacity on the lateral view could potentially be superimposed shadows however
 is new since prior and dedicated nonemergent chest CT is suggested to further
 characterize
