 New PIC line is now looped in the right jugular vein before passing to the

 is midline.  The symmetric degree of increase in mediastinal widening is
 consistent with vascular engorgement from volume overload and/or biventricular

 Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.
