 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increasing O2 requirements, here with
 stroke.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable AP chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, likely resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures an accentuation of heart size.  Despite this, there appears to be
 new, mild pulmonary edema and increased, moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation, but bibasilar atelectasis is possible.  Pleural
 effusions are small, if any.
 
 A right-sided PICC remains coiled in the right internal jugular vein, but the
 tip has retracted somewhat and terminates within the internal jugular vein
 itself.  A a presumed VP shunt is overall unchanged in position.  A
 tracheostomy, median sternotomy wires, and valve replacement are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New, mild pulmonary edema.
 2. A right-sided PICC is coiled and terminates within the right internal
 jugular vein.
