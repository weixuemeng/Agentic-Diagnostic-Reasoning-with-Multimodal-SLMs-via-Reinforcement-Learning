 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cp  // eval for pna

 opacity in the left costophrenic angle is likely related to pleural thickening
 or post inflammatory changes. The heart is enlarged though stable relative to
 study dated ___.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
