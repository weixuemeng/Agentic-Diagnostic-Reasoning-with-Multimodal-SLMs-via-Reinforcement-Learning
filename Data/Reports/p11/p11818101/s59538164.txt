 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:10 PM
  Upper enteric tube tip terminates in the mid stomach.  Endotracheal tube tip
  in appropriate position.  Right PICC at the cavoatrial junction.  Extremely
  low lung volumes accentuate severe cardiomegaly.  Persistent left lower lobe
  consolidation and right base atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure, ___ and
 recent diagnosis of ileus  // OG tube placement     OG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 04:22.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette has increased and mediastinal
 vascular caliber is larger.  This could be due to acute cardiac decompensation
 or volume overload, but the possibility of hemodynamically significant
 pericardial effusion would need to be considered except subsequent chest
 radiograph 04:03 on ___ available the time of this review shows
 improvement in both in cardiomediastinal ___, making cardiac tamponade
 unlikely.
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion, mild edema common right lower lobe
 consolidation are unchanged since earlier in the day common the lung volumes
 remain extremely low.  ET tube, nasogastric drainage tube, transvenous right
 atrial and ventricular pacer leads, are all in standard positions.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.
 
 Than earlier.  Clinical correlation advised to see if additional abdominal
 imaging is necessary.
