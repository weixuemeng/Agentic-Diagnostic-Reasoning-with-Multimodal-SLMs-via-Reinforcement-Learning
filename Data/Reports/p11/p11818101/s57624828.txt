 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly has worsened, accompanied by mild asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  There is substantially greater consolidation in the right lower lung
 while the right upper lung is relatively clear.  Because of the discrepancy,
 this is more likely due to pneumonia than dependent edema.  Severe left Left
 lower lobe consolidation has not changed appreciably since ___,
 either persistent pneumonia or lower lobe collapse.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in close to the estimated
 location of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Transvenous right atrial
 ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements respectively.  No
 pneumothorax.
