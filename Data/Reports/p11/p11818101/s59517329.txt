                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSTEMI and dCHF  // tachypneic and
 hypertension concern for volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.
 
 Again seen is left-sided pacemaker, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.
 
 A small left effusion is present, progressed compared with the prior study. 
 As before, the left hemidiaphragm is tented laterally.
 
 Possible mild cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study.  There is slight upper
 zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 Slight increased retrocardiac density is unchanged and could reflect left
 lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 Otherwise, no focal opacities.  No obvious right pleural effusion.   No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New or increased small left pleural effusion.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF or volume
 overload.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 4. Mild atelectasis left lower lobe, unchanged.
