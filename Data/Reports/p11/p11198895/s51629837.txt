 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the
 mid superior vena cava.  Widespread opacification is seen in both lower lungs,
 more extensive on the right than left.  The likely etiology is a combination
 of substantial bilateral pleural effusions and associated extensive
 atelectasis in the lower lungs.  The pleural effusions are moderate on the
 left and perhaps large on the right side.  Upper lungs appear clear but with
 attenuated irregular lung markings suggesting there may be emphysema.  The
 aortic arch is calcified.  The main pulmonary artery contour is mildly
 prominent.  Although its contours are not well delineated, the heart is
 probably at the upper limits of normal size.  Effacement of the right
 acromiohumeral interval suggests rotator cuff pathology.  The bones are
 probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the lower lungs, greater on the right than left,
 probably reflecting pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, although an
 infectious process is hard to exclude.  Regular lung markings and architecture
 suggesting there may be emphysema.
