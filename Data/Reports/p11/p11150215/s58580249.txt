 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There are no focal
 consolidations, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  Small linear density
 projects over the left mid lung field and inferior tip of the scapula. This is
 of unclear etiology and may represent a focal area of scarring.  There are no
 pneumothoraces.  Surgical clips are seen at the left upper abdomen.
