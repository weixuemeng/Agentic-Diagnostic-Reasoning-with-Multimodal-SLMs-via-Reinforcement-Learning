                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aortic knob demonstrates minimal atherosclerotic
 calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Chronic interstitial opacities are re-
 demonstrated in the lung bases, likely reflective of paraseptal emphysema as
 seen on the prior CT torso. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
