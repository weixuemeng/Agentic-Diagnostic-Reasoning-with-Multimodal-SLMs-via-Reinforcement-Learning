                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  A very trace right pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude, although no large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Possible very minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion, improved since the prior study.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.
