                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Prominent bronchovascular markings are likely secondary to poor inspiration
 and radiograph technique. There are no overt signs of edema.  There is no
 focal opacity, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Degenerative changes are seen within the
 thoracic spine. Surgical clips are seen within the left axillary region.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
