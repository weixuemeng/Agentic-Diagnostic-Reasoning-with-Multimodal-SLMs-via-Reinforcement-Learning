                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 removal of a significant amount of fluid from the right pleural space.  There
 may be a tiny apical pneumothorax.  The patient has taken a somewhat better
 inspiration.  There is some mild reexpansion edema on the right and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
