                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with hematoma in right lower leg,
 evaluate increasing shortness of breath and lethargy.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly as
 before.  Permanent pacer in left axillary position with two intracavitary
 electrodes.  Their position corresponds to the apical portion of the right
 ventricle and right atrial appendage respectively.  The position of the
 electrodes indicates marked widening of the right atrium.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is now again more congested than on the next previous examination,
 and in addition, the lateral pleural sinuses are now again blunted indicating
 bilateral pleural effusions.  A diffuse hazy _____ density overlying the right
 lower-most lung field is suspicious for some infiltrate, and additional
 aspiration pneumonitis should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reoccurrence of severe CHF with pulmonary congestion and now
 bilateral pleural effusion.  The findings are not _____ similar to what was
 found on the first examination of ___, but the patient had a
 temporary episode of improvement on the next preceding study of ___.
