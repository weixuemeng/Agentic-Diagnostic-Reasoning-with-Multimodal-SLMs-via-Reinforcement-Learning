                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:48 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower extremity wound.  Possible pneumonia or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe.  Heterogeneous opacification throughout both lungs,
 accompanied by right pleural effusion is most easily explained by pulmonary
 edema, but other possibilities abound such as drug reaction, hemorrhage, or
 multifocal pneumonia.
 
 The transvenous right atrial pacer lead terminates more medial than the
 expected location of the normal right atrial appendage.  It could be in a
 gigantic right atrium or running through the tricuspid valve toward the
 pulmonary outflow tract of the right ventricle.  No pneumothorax.
