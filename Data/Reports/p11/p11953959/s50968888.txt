 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval improvement in the right pleural effusion with improved visualization
 of the right hemidiaphragm and previously seen right mid lung opacity likely
 represents fluid in the minor fissure as it is now resolved.  There remains to
 be some fluid in the right major fissure.  Mild atelectasis noted in the right
 lung base again noted.  Interval mild improvement in small left pleural
 effusion is also seen with improved visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Stable postoperative appearance of the trachea.  No pneumothorax. The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.    Left PICC in lower SVC. 
 Vertebral hardware unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions
