                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent tracheobroncoplasty for TBM who have apical and
 basal pneumothoraces.  // query pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  There are unchanged bibasilar
 opacities compatible with atelectasis versus consolidation.
 Small left pleural effusion.
 Mild cardiomegaly as before.
 The 2 right-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position with no residual
 pneumothorax on this radiograph.
 Right central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  EKG
 leads overlie the chest wall.
 Spinal fusion hardware projects over the lower cervical spine as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderately well inflated lungs with unchanged bibasilar atelectasis versus
 consolidation and a small left pleural effusion.
 2. Interval resolution of right sided pneumothorax with unchanged position of
 the 2 right chest tubes.
 3. New right central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
