                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall.  Pre-operative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a small right apical pleural
 thickening with an adjacent probably calcified nodule that is unchanged since
 at least ___.  A streaky opacity across the right lower lung is confirmed in
 the lateral views to be right middle lobe atelectasis.  No other focal
 opacities are identified.  Mild to moderated cardiomegaly is chronic and there
 are no vascular findings of cardiac decompensation.  Otherwise, the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.   Mild to moderated cardiomegaly is chronic and there are no vascular
 findings of cardiac decompensation.
 
 2.  Stable right apical pleural thickening with adjacent calcified nodule.
 
 3.  No displaced rib fracture is appreciated but conventional radiography is
 not designed for detection of subtle chest cage trauma; for that
 determination, detail views of the locations of physical findings would be
 required.
