                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Moderate cardiomegaly with unfolding of the thoracic aorta is
 stable.  Mediastinal contour and left hilar contour are unremarkable. Subtly
 increased opacity at the inferior right hilus is seen on frontal view only,
 without lateral correlate. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural servers are
 clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtly increased opacity at the margin of the inferior right hilus is seen on
 frontal view only, suspicious for early or developing infection but
 potentially could all be explained by low lung volumes, repeat with full
 inspiration may be helpful.
