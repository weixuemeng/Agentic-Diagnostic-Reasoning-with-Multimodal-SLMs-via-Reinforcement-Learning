                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Several days of productive cough and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  The lungs are clear. There appears to be oligemia to
 the right lung base with a cut off of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery
 (___'s sign), suspicious for a pulmonary embolus. Prominence of the
 hila is noted bilaterally.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Oligemia of the right lower lobe suggestive of pulmonary embolus.
 CTA of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
