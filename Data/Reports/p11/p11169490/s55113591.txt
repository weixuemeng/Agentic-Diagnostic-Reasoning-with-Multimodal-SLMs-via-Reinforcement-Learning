                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, COPD, here with volume overload, cough and chills.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Heart size is borderline with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There are small bilateral effusions. 
 On the left, there is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is minimal atelectasis at the
 right base.  Curvilinear densities over the diaphragm suggests calcification
 along the diaphragm and could reflect prior asbestos exposure.  
 
 There is severe osteoarthritis involving both glenohumeral joints and marked
 narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance, consistent with bilateral chronic
 rotator cuff tears.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Borderline cardiomegaly, with left ventricular configuration.
 2.  CHF with bilateral effusions.
 3.  Increased retrocardiac density, which could reflect left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.
 4.  Diaphragmatic/pleural surface calcification -- is there a history of prior
 asbestos exposure?
 5.  Severe bilateral glenohumeral osteoarthritis and chronic rotator cuff
 tears.
