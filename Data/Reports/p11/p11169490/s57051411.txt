                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ yo M transfer with CABG, pAF on Xarelto,
 pulm HTN, pulm asbestosis, diastolic CHF presents to the ED for HF
 decompensation and has had fevers to ___.8.  // Pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single view at ___:___ PM
 
 COMPARISON:   ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive pleural disease and calcification is present. Subtle CHF may be
 difficult to exclude in this field of the increased interstitial markings
 which was present on the previous study.  The interstitium markings may have
 increased slightly.  The heart is grossly enlarged and has increased in size
 somewhat since the previous study. This could be due to cardiac
 decompensation, but a pericardial effusion might be considered..  The osseous
 structures are normal for age.  The patient has median sternotomy closures and
 mediastinal clips consistent with coronary artery bypass graft.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing cardiac size.
 
 Extensive pleural calcification probably not greatly changed since the
 previous examination. However, there iis subtle increase in pulmonary density
 which may indicate CHF.
