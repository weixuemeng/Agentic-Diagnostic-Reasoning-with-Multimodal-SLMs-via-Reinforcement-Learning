                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, weight loss, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  The hila appear somewhat enlarged bilaterally, but no pulmonary
 edema is present.  Left basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests small pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence to suggest tuberculosis.
 2.  Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis. 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 4.  Enlarged hila bilaterally is suggestive of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
