                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, dementia and ligated with difficulty
 ambulating.  Evaluate for an acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There has been further aeration of the left lung base.  Increased
 patchy opacification of the right lung base is noted.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged with
 dense calcifications in the aortic arch.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased patchy opacity within the right lung base is likely
 atelectasis, although, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
