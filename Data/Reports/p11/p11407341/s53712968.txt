                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT both dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF history, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  The lung volumes
 are low.  The heart is markedly enlarged.  There is obscuration of the
 retrocardiac space, which could reflect technique.  The possibility of tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions is not excluded.  While there is no overt
 pulmonary edema, there may be minimal interstitial edema.  The mediastinal
 contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with possible mild interstitial edema and tiny
 pleural effusions.  Limited exam due to low lung volumes.
