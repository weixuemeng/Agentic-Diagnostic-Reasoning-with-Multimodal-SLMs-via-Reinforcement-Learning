 year old man with lymphoma, now with fevers, malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___.  CT
 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath is in stable position.
 
 There is a moderate right pleural effusion, slightly decreased in size from
 the most recent prior CT in ___. Additionally, there is adjacent
 pulmonary opacity involving the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, which
 could represent areas of collapse or infection. There is streaky opacity at
 the base of the left lung, most consistent with atelectasis. No left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity are minimally
 decreased in size from CT in ___.  Pulmonary opacity likely reflects right
 lower lobe collapse however underlying infection should be considered in the
 appropriate setting.  Left basal atelectasis.
