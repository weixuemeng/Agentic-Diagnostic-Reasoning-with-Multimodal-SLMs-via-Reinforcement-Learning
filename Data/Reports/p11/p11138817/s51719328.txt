                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GTC in a.m., to assess for intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the outside study of ___, the patient has taken
 a much better inspiration.  The large apparent hiatal hernia is not
 appreciated, suggesting that this represents a sliding process and any
 residual hernia is filled with fluid-containing stomach.
 
 The heart is normal in size.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature
 could reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  No evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion.
