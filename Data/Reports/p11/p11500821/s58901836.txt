                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and dyspnea // eval for edema,
 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 Liver MRI with and without contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, opacification at the left
 lung base has largely improved, with a small amount of plate-like atelectasis
 in the left lower lobe.  Lung volumes remain low.  Right lower lobe
 opacification has resolved.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There
 is no central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart is normal in size.  Dobhoff tube descends below the diaphragm into the
 stomach and out of the field-of-view.  Medial displacement of the stomach
 bubble is consistent with splenomegaly, better assessed on liver MR from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
 2. Resolved right lower lobe opacification.  Improved left basilar atelectasis
 and plate-like atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 3. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Persistent low lung volumes, likely secondary to ascites, better
 demonstrated on prior MR.
