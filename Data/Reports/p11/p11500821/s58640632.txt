                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increase shortness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are seen with overlying
 atelectasis.  Medial right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation due to pneumonia is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Subtle lateral left mid lung opacity projecting over the posterior left
 seventh rib is most likely due to overlap of structures ; previously seen left
 upper lung opacity is much less conspicuous on the current study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral, moderate right and small left, pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  Medial right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, but consolidation due to infection is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
