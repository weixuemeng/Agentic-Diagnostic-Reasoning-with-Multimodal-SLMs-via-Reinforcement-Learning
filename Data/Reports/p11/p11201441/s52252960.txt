                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from ladder with complicated ICU stay, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal view of the chest shows a newly placed
 tracheostomy tube in satisfactory position.  There has been removal of a
 feeding tube.  The right subclavian catheter tip terminates in the mid to low
 SVC.  Although there has been improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions,
 there is still a moderate right and small left pleural effusion with resultant
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinum is
 widened but stable.  There is no pneumothorax. Stable displaced rib fractures
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in bilateral pleural effusions; however, a moderate
 right and small left effusion persist.
