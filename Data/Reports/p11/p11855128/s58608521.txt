 CHEST TWO VIEWS ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  This film is taken with improved technique.  The PICC line tip is
 in the SVC.  It still projects slightly more laterally than is typically seen,
 but this could be due to vascular engorgement.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Findings are compatible with CHF.
