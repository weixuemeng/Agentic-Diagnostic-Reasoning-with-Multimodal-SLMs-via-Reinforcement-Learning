 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Severe aortic stenosis, chronic heart failure, evaluation for
 pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly with
 signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  The presence of a small
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  No new parenchymal opacity
 suggesting of pneumonia.  The signs of moderate fluid overload are slightly
 less severe than on the previous image.
