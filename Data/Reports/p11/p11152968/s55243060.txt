                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are similar, with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted, and widening of the superior
 mediastinum, likely due to low lung volumes, with rightward deviation of the
 trachea.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 again noted.  Left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive glenohumeral joint degenerative
 changes are again seen bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Chronic elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm with associated left basilar atelectasis.
