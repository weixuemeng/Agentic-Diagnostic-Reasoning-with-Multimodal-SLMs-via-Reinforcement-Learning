 moderately enlarged.  At least a small right pleural effusion is present, but
 it is hard to say whether the volume has changed.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Ends at the level of the sternal notch, no less than 7.5 cm from the carina,
 could be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating, nasogastric tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view, and the left internal jugular line ends in the
 left brachiocephalic vein.
