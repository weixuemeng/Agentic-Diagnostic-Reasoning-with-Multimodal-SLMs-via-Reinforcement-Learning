 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 3 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent aspiration causing hypoxemic
 respiratory failure now requiring NGT placement  // Assess NGT placement. This
 will be performed in a two-step process requiring two films.    Assess NGT
 placement. This will be performed in a two-step p
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube has
 been removed and replaced with a Dobhoff tube that extends to the upper to mid
 portion of the stomach.
 There is increasing opacification at the right base with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with collapse of the right lower lobe and possibly a
 portion of the middle lobe.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Again the possibility of superimposed aspiration is difficult to exclude,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
