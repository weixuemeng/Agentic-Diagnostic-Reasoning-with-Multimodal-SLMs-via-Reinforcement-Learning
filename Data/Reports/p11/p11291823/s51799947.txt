  ET tube terminates approximately 5.7 cm above the carina.  New since prior
  study is a right IJ central venous catheter with distal tip terminating in the
  low SVC. Additionally noted is a severely withdrawn enteric tube with distal
  tip visualized in the upper esophagus near the top portion of the film.  Also
  new since prior are diffuse hazy airspace opacities involving the entirety of
  the right lung, compatible sequelae of aspiration.  Also noted is new more
  prominent right mediastinal widening; although this could be secondary to
  patient rotation and/or sequela of aspiration additionally, in the setting of
  a recently placed right IJ line, this could represent mediastinal hematoma. 
  Recommend repeat chest imaging with improved technique/less rotation to
  further evaluate.
  
   The findings above, including apparent mediastinal prominence, were discussed
  by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 1:38 AM, at the
  time of discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ET tube and right IJ CVL.  // Evaluate
 ETT and right IJ CVL placement.      Evaluate ETT and right IJ CVL placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an endotracheal
 tube in place with its tip approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. Right IJ
 catheter extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.  Increased widening
 of the mediastinum on the right following central catheter placement raises
 the possibility of hematoma.
 
 The The Dobhoff tube has been pulled back so that the opaque portion is in the
 lower cervical a esophagus.  Increased haziness of opacification in the right
 hemithorax is consistent with layering pleural effusion, though the
 possibility of superimposed aspiration would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical
