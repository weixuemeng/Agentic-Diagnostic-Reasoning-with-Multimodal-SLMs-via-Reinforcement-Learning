                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from 1:18 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 6.0 cm above the
 carina.  A double lumen right IJ catheter terminates at the low SVC.  Again
 seen is severe asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the right, unchanged since
 the prior radiograph, with underlying atelectasis. A superimposed right lower
 lobe consolidation cannot be excluded..  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of severe pulmonary edema, worse on the
 right.  Superimposed consolidation at the right base cannot be excluded.
