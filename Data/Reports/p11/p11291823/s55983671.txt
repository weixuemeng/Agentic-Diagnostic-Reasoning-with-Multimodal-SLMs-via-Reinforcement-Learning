                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure, RLL
 atelectasis.  // Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube terminates
 in the left upper quadrant.  Left IJ central venous line terminates in the
 midline, in the region of the brachiocephalic vein.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Right lower lobe collapse and significant right middle lobe
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased since the
 prior study.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change in right middle and lower lobe collapse, with increased atelectasis
 in left lower lobe.
