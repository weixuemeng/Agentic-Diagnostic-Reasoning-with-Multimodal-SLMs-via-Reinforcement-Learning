                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent extubation, fluid overload, please assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable severe
 cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary edema is persistent though improved, now moderate. 
 Right pleural effusion also decreased, now small in size.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis noted, with progressive minimal increase in retrocardiac space. 
 Right dual-lumen catheter with the most distal tip in the distal SVC and
 proximal tip in right brachiocephalic vein.   Left-sided central venous
 catheter with tip likely in the left brachiocephalic vein. Endotracheal tube
 is in standard position. Nasogastric tube is seen passing into the stomach and
 out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of right lung base likely due to decreased
 pleural effusion.  Slightly increased retrocardiac opacity, likely a
 combination of increased atelectasis.
