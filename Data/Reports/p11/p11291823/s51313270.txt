 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:26 AM
  
  
  1. Two (2) subsequent frontal projections of the chest and abdomen,
  respectively, demonstrate advancement of an enteric tube.  The final image
  over the upper abdomen demonstrates the distal tip over the approximate
  location of the gastric body.
  2. Stable at least moderate cardiomegaly.
  3. Centrally predominant fluffy airspace opacities are suggestive of pulmonary
  vascular congestion and possibly mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left
  and progressed in comparison to chest x-ray from ___.
  4. Opacity at the right lung base, however, appears progressed and more
  confluent, and may represent sequelae of aspiration or pneumonia in the
  correct clinical setting.
  5. No pneumothorax.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.  No left pleural
  effusion.
  C. Hostage ___ at 22:57.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD on HD, aspiration PNA needing 2 stage
 xray for dobhoff placement  // assess dobhoff placement, 2 stage xray
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 To chest radiographs thickened ___ min apart repositioning of the feeding tube
 from the mid esophagus to the upper stomach, wire stylet still in place.
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, but not in
 overall severity.  Right basal atelectasis is still severe.  Small right
 pleural effusion is probably larger.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  No
 pneumothorax.
