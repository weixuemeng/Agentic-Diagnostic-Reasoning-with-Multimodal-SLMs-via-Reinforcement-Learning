 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration
 pneumonia and on HD  // Assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing atelectasis at the
 right lung base has almost completely resolved.  The right lung base is better
 ventilated than on the previous radiograph.  Likewise, a pre-existing opacity
 at the right lung base is substantially improved.  However, in the interval,
 the patient has developed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  A new
 retrocardiac atelectasis is visualized.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No
 larger pleural effusions.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.
