 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:58 PM
  IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia.  Particularly since
  left mid lung opacities are somewhat nodular in appearance, short-term
  followup radiographs are recommended in order to show resolution within eight
  weeks.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips again project along the mediastinum.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a new patchy
 opacity in the right lower lung worrisome for pneumonia, probably located
 posteriorly, as well as patchy left mid lung opacities, also concerning for
 pneumonia but more nodular.  Volume loss in the right hemithorax with scarring
 in the right costophrenic sulcus appears unchanged.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  The bones are probably demineralized to some degree.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia.  Particularly since
 left mid lung opacities are somewhat nodular in appearance, short-term
 followup radiographs are recommended in order to show resolution within eight
 weeks.
