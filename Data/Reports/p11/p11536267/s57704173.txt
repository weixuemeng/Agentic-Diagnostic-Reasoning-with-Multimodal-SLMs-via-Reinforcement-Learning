                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes without
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Large
 hiatal hernia is noted.  Bibasilar opacities are better seen on CT chest of
 the same date.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No focal consolidation.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.  Bibasilar opacities are better seen on CTA chest of
 the same date, which likely reflect aspiration.
