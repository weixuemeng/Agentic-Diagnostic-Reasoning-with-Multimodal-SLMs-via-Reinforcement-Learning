                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with T12 burst fracture now presenting with left
 flank/chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph and torso CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low accentuating the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Opacities at both lung bases are
 likely related to atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. No new focal
 consolidation identified. In the setting of extremely low lung volumes,
 however, it is difficult to assess the cardiovascular status.  There is no
 pneumothorax. There is a slightly displaced fracture of the anterior left
 second rib, with a slightly sclerotic border suggesting subacute etiology. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis. No new focal consolidation.
