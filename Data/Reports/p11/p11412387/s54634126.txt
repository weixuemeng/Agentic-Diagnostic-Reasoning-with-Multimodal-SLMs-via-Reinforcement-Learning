                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with RA s/p intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 5.3 cm above the carina.  The orogastric tube ends
 off of the radiograph.  The lung volumes are low and there is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely positional.  The aorta is
 unfolded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina and could be advanced 1 cm
 for optimal positioning.
 2. Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
