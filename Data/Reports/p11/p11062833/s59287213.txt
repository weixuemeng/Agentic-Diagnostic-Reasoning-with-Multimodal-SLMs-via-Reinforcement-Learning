                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 Allowing for differences in technique and projection, there has been minimal
 change in appearance of the chest since recent study except for possible
 increase in size of a moderate, partially-layering right pleural effusion.
