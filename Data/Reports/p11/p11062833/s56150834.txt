 INDICATION:  ___M with CVL placement.  // CVL placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest radiograph and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   ET tube tip terminates 6 cm above the
 carinal. OG tube extends into the left upper quadrant. A right IJ central
 venous catheter is seen extending into the SVC though the tip is difficult to
 clearly visualized given the overlapping with the AICD. No pneumothorax. No
 change in large pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter likely extending into
 the SVC though the tip cannot be clearly assessed due to overlap with the AICD
 wires.
