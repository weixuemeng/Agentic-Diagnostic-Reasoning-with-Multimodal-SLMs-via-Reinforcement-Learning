                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, cough, hypoxia  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes.  A left
 chest pacemaker is identified, its leads which appear intact and in stable
 position.  The heart is enlarged, not significantly changed.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion though obscuration
 of the left costophrenic angle may reflect trace pleural fluid or
 alternatively atelectasis.  Relative to prior examination, retrocardiac
 opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is new for which
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  Findings can be additionally secondary
 to atelectasis.  Opacification involving the right mid and upper lung zone
 appears somewhat more conspicuous relative to prior study.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures and upper abdomen are without an
 acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Right mid and upper lung zone
 consolidation as well as retrocardiac opacification are more conspicuous or
 new relative to prior study for which an infectious process is difficult to
 exclude.
