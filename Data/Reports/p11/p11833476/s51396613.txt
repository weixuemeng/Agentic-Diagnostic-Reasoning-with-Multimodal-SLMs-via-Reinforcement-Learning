                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with OG tube  // eval OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 CT chest with contrast ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The OG tube terminates in the upper to mid stomach. The left-sided PICC
 terminates at the mid SVC.  2 chest tubes remain in place with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with
 pulmonary edema appear grossly unchanged from prior.  The possibility of
 superimposed pneumonia is extremely difficult to exclude in this setting. 
 Again seen are the previously described left rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The OG tube terminates in the upper to mid stomach.  Study is otherwise
 grossly unchanged.
