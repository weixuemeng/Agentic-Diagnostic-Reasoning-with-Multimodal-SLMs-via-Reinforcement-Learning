                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with mvc, rib fx, ptx  // eval for interval change in ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 907 and CT torso from
 ___:00.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted.  The known left-sided pneumothorax is not seen on
 this supine film.  Retrocardiac opacity is likely in part due to atelectasis. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Displaced left
 lateral rib fractures are also seen.  Linear radiopaque density projecting
 over the chest is most likely external.
