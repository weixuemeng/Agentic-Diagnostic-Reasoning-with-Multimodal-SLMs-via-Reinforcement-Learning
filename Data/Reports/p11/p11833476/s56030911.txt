                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior
 study.  Subtle lucencies are adjacent the mediastinum are likely artifactual
 due to a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema.  Patchy bilateral
 airspace opacities are noted, there has been improvement in aeration of the
 right upper lobe with a more focal area of consolidation in the right lower
 lobe.  The given the rapidly changing appearance, this likely reflects
 pulmonary edema.  The previously demonstrated left pneumothorax is less
 clearly seen on today's study.  Multiple rib fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with pulmonary edema, infection cannot be excluded.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Description findings were discussed with the trauma SICU
 resident by telephone at ___ on ___, at the time of discovery.
