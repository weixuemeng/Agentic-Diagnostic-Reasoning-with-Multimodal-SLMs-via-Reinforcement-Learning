                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS  // effusion, PTX,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been placement of a second left-sided
 chest drain.  This results in a significant decrease in the left-sided pleural
 fluid however there is a small to moderate-sized left pneumothorax.  Airspace
 opacity in the right lung has progressed in the apex but improved in the right
 lower lung.  Appearances are concerning for liver pneumonia.  Multiple rib
 fractures are seen along the left lateral chest, presumed to be postoperative.
 A left-sided subclavian catheter is unchanged in position compared to the
 prior study.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the
 level of the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 Small to moderate size left pneumothorax.
 
 Consolidation in the right upper lobe suspicious for infection.
