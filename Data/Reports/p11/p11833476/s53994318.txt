 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:06 PM
  
  -Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities have mildly worsened since chest
  radiograph from earlier same day. Although findings are consistent with severe
  pulmonary edema, differential also includes multifocal infection and ARDS.
  -In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier same day at 05:06, there has
  been interval removal of the left chest tube.  A right sided PICC line is re-
  demonstrated, with distal tip projecting over the mid SVC.
  -A vertically oriented tube courses craniocaudally over the midline, with
  distal tip appearing to project over the body of the stomach, likely an
  enteric tube.
  -Left-sided pleural thickening, related to known extrapleural/pleural
  hematomas, are unchanged in appearance.
  -No right pleural effusion.  Probable left pleural effusion is unchanged in
  appearance.  No pneumothorax identified.
  -Patient is status post multilevel left rib resection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ hx of seizures and DM2 p/w with MVC, found to have L
 ___-10th rib fractures c/b left hemothorax now s/p left thoracotomy for left
 lung decortication, left diaphragmatic repair, left rib resections x2 w/ 2
 left chest tubes, recurrent fevers, now extubated.  // dobhoff placement,
 chest tube removed. evolution of pneumothorax.   dobhoff placement, chest tube
 removed. evolution of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___, 05:06.  As compared to the previous radiograph,
 the bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with multifocal pneumonia or
 ARDS have slightly worsened in extent and severity.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  The area of substantial pleural thickening along the left-sided rib
 fractures, reflecting known hematomas, is constant in extent and severity. 
 The left chest tube has been removed.  The nasogastric tube and the right PICC
 line are in constant position.
