                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trauma, hemothorax s/p washout, rib
 resection, multiple chest tubes  // please evaluate for interval change    
 please evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  The 2 less chest tubes remain in place
 with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications,
 more prominent on the right, are consistent with pulmonary edema that appears
 to be worsening at the right base.  In view of the diffuse pulmonary changes,
 the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be extremely difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 The previously described left rib fractures are again noted.
