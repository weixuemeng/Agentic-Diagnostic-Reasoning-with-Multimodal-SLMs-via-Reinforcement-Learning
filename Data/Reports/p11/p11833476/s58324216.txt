 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:16 PM
  Increased opacification of the left hemi thorax is likely secondary to
  combination of atelectasis and increase pleural fluid.  Left chest tube is
  unchanged in position.  There is increased consolidation in the right
  perihilar region which may be secondary to increased edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left hemothorax s/p chest tube  // please
 evaluate for interval change      please evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 09:34.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the left hemi thorax, progressive widening of the
 pleural margin, and some increase in rightward mediastinal shift all point to
 increasing left pleural effusion, not surprising since the left pleural drain
 has been partially withdrawn, now close to the intercostal plane.  Its side
 port in the left chest wall could drain pleural contents into the subcutaneous
 tissue.  Given the multiple displaced left rib fractures, hemothorax should be
 the first consideration.
 
 Left heart border is obscured but the heart appears larger, explaining new
 mild edema in the right lung.  No pneumothorax.
