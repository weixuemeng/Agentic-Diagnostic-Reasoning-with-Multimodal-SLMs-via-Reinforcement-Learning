                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Rotated positioning.  The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
 flattened, consistent with COPD.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead
 tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. 
 Prominence of the right perihilar structures is likely accentuated due to
 rotated positioning, as these project over the spine in the setting of right
 convex scoliosis.  Clips are noted along the right paratracheal region, with
 slight leftward deviation of the trachea.  There is minimal biapical pleural
 thickening.  Deformity of the right fifth rib raises the question of old
 trauma or surgery.  No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle posteriorly is incidentally noted.
 
 Small (18 mm), rounded lucency projecting over the heart anteriorly on the
 lateral view measuring is seen only on the lateral view and most likely
 represents artifact due to superimposition of soft tissue structures and
 vascular markings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No significant change compared with ___.  Doubt acute pulmonary process.
 In particular, no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  
 
 2) Evidence of right paratracheal surgery for which clinical correlation is
 requested.
