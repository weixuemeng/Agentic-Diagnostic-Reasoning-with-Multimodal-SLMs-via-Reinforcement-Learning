                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus with report of right-sided weakness before
 seizure onset.  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No
 supine evidence of pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is identified.
 The heart size is top normal.  Fullness of the mediastinum is presumably
 related to positioning.  There are remote right sided rib fractures.
 
 An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip approximately 5 cm above
 the carina.  An esophageal catheter is in place with tip within the stomach
 and side port at or just beyond the expected location of the gastroesophageal
 junction.  A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is in standard position.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy.
