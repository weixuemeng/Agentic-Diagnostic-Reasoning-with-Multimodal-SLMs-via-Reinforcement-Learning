 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy.  ICD remains

 surgery as surgical chain sutures are also demonstrated centrally in the right
 juxtamediastinal region at the level of the clavicle.  Lungs are well expanded
 and clear.  Bones are remarkable for above-mentioned rib deformities as well
 as scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.
