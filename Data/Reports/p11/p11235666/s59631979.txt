                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, s/p fall, assess for fractures, effusion,
 consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms,
 unchanged in appearance since prior examination.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and
 hila are unremarkable.
 
 There are intact median sternotomy wires.  A left anterior chest wall
 pacemaker device lead tips are in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for chronic left rib
 deformities and chronic mid left clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of
 chest cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged
 with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
 3.  Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of emphysema and chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.
