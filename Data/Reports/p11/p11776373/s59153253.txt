                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall with right rib pain and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Coarse interstitial markings are again
 noted suggestive chronic underlying lung disease.  Persistent opacity projects
 in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe potentially due to scarring. 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base and left lung laterally is again
 compatible with pleural plaques.  There is no evidence of effusion.  There is
 no new consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No
 displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  If high clinical concern for
 fracture, dedicated rib series could be performed.
