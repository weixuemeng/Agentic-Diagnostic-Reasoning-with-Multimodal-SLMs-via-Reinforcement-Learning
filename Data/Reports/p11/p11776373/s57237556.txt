 FINDINGS:  Chest, AP and lateral.  There is no significant interval change
 from the prior study.  Again noted is chronic of changes related to COPD with
 extensive parenchymal scarring and bilateral calcified pleural plaques. 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is also chronic.  There is no
 airspace consolidation.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is dense calcification of the aortic valve, aortic annulus, and mitral
 annulus.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.

 plaques.
