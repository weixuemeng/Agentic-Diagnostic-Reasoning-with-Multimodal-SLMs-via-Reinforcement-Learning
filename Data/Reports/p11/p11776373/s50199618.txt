                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tingling all over, tender to palpation of right chest, question
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is read in conjunction with the CT torso on the same day. 
 There is prominence of interstitial markings consistent with emphysema. 
 Peripheral nodular thickening is consistent with pleural plaques as seen on
 CT.  Hazy opacity in the right upper lobe most likely represents pneumonia. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 notable for a tortuous aorta, but is otherwise unremarkable.  Mild
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe emphysema and pleural plaques.
 2.  Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe which most likely represents
 pneumonia.
