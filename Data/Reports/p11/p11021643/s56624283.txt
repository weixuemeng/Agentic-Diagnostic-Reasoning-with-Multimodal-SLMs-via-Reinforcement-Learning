                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as CTA chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are noted.  There is mild perihilar opacity which represents
 central airways inflammatory process or possibly an atypical pneumonia. 
 Please note this finding is equivocal and possibility of crowded
 bronchovasculature is also considered.  No lobar consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. 
 Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes of the right shoulder noted.
 Clips in the upper abdomen noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle perihilar opacity could represent an atypical pneumonia or
 airways inflammation.  Please correlate clinically.  No lobar consolidation or
 convincing signs of CHF.
