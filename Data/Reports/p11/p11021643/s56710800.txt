 INDICATION:  ___F with abd pain, cough, CHF  // Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires are
 again seen.  Lung volumes are somewhat low though allowing for this, the lungs
 are clear.  Subtle linear peripheral opacities in the left upper lung are
 unchanged and could reflect subtle areas of perifissural scarring.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. 
 Imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
