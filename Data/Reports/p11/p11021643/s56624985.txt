                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The vascular pedicle is widened suggesting
 fluid overload.  Mild central hazy pulmonary vascular prominence suggests
 slight congestion, but less striking than on the recent prior examination with
 reduced perihilar fullness.  The lungs appear hyperinflated.  Streaky left mid
 lung opacities suggest minor atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
