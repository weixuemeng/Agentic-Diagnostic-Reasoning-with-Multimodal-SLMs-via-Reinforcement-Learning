                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and nausea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are median sternotomy wires which appear intact.  There are
 surgical clips projecting over the mediastinum.  Lung volumes are somewhat
 low, and there is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature without frank
 pulmonary edema.  There is no focal airspace opacity.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Given AP technique, the heart size is likely
 normal.  There are significant degenerative changes at the AC and glenohumeral
 joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
 2.  No focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
