                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post right central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 7:13 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine portable view of the chest.  There has been interval
 placement of a right IJ central venous catheter whose tip is likely in the
 right atrium.  Retraction by 3 cm would be ideal for placement within the
 mid-to-distal SVC.  Given lower lung volumes, the appearance of the lungs has
 not changed.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right-sided central venous catheter with tip likely in the
 right atrium and retraction of 3 cm would be ideal.  This was conveyed to Dr.
