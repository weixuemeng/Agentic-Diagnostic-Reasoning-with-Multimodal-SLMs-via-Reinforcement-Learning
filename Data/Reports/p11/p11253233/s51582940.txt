                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for chronic aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with some flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  Prominence of
 relatively coarse interstitial markings could reflect chronic lung disease,
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both.  No definite acute focal
 pneumonia.
 
 There is generalized osteopenia of the thoracic spine with loss of height of
 several vertebral bodies.
