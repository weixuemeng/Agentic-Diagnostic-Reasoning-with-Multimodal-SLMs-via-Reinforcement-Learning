                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process, pneumonia versus
 widened mediastinum, in a patient with severe chest pain radiating from the
 back.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a likely normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left base opacity is likely related to a
 combination of a small to moderate left pleural effusion and associated
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small to moderate left pleural effusion with associated adjacent opacities.
 A CT should be considered to evaluate for an underlying cause for the pleural
 effusion.
 2. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
