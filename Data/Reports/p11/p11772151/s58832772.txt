 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD3 CABG  // evaluate for effusion/PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes continue to remain low.  There is a right-sided central line
 terminating in the distal SVC.  Patchy left lower lobe opacities compatible
 with worsening atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.  Likely tiny left apical
 pneumothorax status post removal of left-sided chest tube.  Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Sternotomy sutures, surgical clips project over
 the mediastinum.  Bony thorax remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post removal of left-sided chest tube with a tiny left apical
 pneumothorax measuring 4 mm.  Mild interval worsening of left basilar
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.  Rest of the findings are stable.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Continued followup chest radiographs to assess stability
 of the tiny left apical pneumothorax recommended.
