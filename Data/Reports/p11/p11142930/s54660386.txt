                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement.  Evaluate for effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate intact
 median sternotomy wires.  Compared to the prior radiograph there has been
 interval increase in lung volumes with continued bibasilar atelectasis and
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There has been interval resolution of the
 left apical pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is identified.  Stable
 cardiomegaly is again noted.  Prosthetic aortic valve is seen on the lateral
 view. Expected post operative mediastinal air is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in lung volumes with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2.  Interval resolution of left apical pneumothorax.
