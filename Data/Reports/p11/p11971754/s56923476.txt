                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with microcytic anemia  // Eval for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are hyperinflated.
 Patchy opacities in the lung apices, more pronounced on the right, likely
 reflect areas of scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Biapical patchy opacities likely reflect areas of scarring, more pronounced on
 the right.
