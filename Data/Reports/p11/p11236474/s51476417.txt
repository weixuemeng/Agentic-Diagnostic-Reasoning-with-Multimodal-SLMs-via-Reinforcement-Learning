 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute gastrointestinal bleed, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 upper lobe parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved.  However, there
 is a newly appeared left-sided pleural effusion of moderate extent.  The
 effusion is not associated with a substantial elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  However, atelectasis at the left lung base has developed.
 
 Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The course of the
 dialysis catheter is constant.
