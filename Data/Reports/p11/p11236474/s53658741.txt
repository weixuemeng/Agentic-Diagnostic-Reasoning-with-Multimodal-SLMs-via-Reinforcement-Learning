                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemodialysis line which was pulled.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Previously noted opacity within
 the right upper lobe has somewhat improved with residual linear opacities
 likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  Additionally, aeration of the
 left lung base is improved and subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Inferior vena
 cava filter is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe and left
 lung base.  Minimal residual subsegmental atelectasis is noted in these
 regions.  No hemodialysis catheter is identified.
