                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotrachial intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip terminating
 approximately 3 cm from the carina.  The heart size remains moderately
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged with the aorta appearing
 tortuous and likely dilated.  Widening of the superior mediastinal contour
 also may in part be due to the presence of lymphadenopathy.  Hazy
 opacifications of both lungs likely indicate the presence of moderate-sized
 layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis, but infection is difficult to exclude.  Peripheral
 wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field is re- demonstrated.  There
 appears to be mild pulmonary edema.  Assessment for pneumothorax is limited on
 this supine exam though no large pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip in standard position.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Layering
 moderate size bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities
 persist as does a wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field.  Tortuous
 and likely dilated aorta with probable mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
