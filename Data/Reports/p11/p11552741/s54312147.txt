  1. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. 
  Infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
  setting.
  2. Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field is concerning
  for an area of infarction. Further assessment with chest CTA is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, fatigue
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is at least moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous, and potentially dilated.  There may be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar airspace opacities with moderate
 size bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, likely reflective of
 compressive atelectasis though infection or aspiration is not excluded.  A
 peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field may reflect an
 area of infarction.  No large pneumothorax is detected though assessment is
 limited as the patient's neck and chin project over the left apex.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.  Degenerative changes are seen involving
 both shoulders and within the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
 2. Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field is concerning
 for an area of infarction.  Further assessment with chest CTA is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CTA is recommended for further assessment for
 pulmonary embolism.
