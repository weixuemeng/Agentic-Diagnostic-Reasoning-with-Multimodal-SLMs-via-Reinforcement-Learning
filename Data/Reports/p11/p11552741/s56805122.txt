                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decreased O2 sat  // fluid overload      . 
 Review of OMR indicates a history of metastatic lung carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  From ___ at 15 46
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with ___ at 15:46, the right IJ catheter is no longer
 seen.  There is suggestion of a small right apical pneumothorax, new or
 significantly more pronounced than on compared with the prior study.
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly and what appears to be vascular engorgement
 and CHF, as well as extensive opacity of both lungs, including air
 bronchograms in the retrocardiac region and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm Again seen is thickening of the minor fissure with some hazy
 focal opacity immediately above lateral portion of the minor fissure.
 
 The possibility of small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 The overall degree of vascular engorgement and opacity in the lungs is similar
 to the prior film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval removal of right IJ central line.
 2. New or significantly more pronounced small right apical pneumothorax.
 3. Cardiomegaly.  Allowing for obscuration by surrounding opacities, this is
 similar to prior.
 4. Probable CHF, with interstitial edema, similar to the prior study.  The
 presence of an alveolar component in certain areas cannot be excluded.
 5. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and opacity at the right lung
 base, similar to the prior film.
 6. Neoplastic abnormalities in the lungs would be difficult to distinguish
 from other opacities radiographically.
 
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings, in particular, the new right apical pneumothorax,
 were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.___ by phone 2 minutes
 after discovery at 16:54 pm on ___.
