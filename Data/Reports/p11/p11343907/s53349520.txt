                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the history of congestive heart failure
 with mechanical mitral valve, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia and ejection
 fraction of 30%.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Extreme cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is interval improvement in pulmonary
 edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Because of the large
 cardiac silhouette, it is hard to exclude underlying consolidation, but no
 overt pneumonia is demonstrated.
