                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___,
 chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube had been pulled back and is now 2.7 cm above carina.  Right-sided PICC
 line and new right subclavian line ends in the lower dilated superior vena
 cava.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Mild pulmonary congestion has completely
 resolved and small bilateral pleural effusions have improved.  Severe
 cardiomegaly in this patient with prior sternotomy and mitral valve repair is
 most explained by dilation of both atrium.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position including the NG tube.
 
 2.  Severe cardiomegaly is stable without sign of pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Small pleural effusion has improved.
