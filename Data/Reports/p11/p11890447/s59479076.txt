                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with possible pneumonia and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is within normal limits.  There are bilateral opacities
 most prominent within the right perihilar region and the left upper lobe. 
 This may represent aspiration or developing pneumonia.  Vascular pedicle is
 not widened.  Thus this is felt to be less likely related to pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothoraces.  Degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are seen.
