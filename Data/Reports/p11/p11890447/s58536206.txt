                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with rib pain after fall, question fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate minimal left
 basilar atelectasis.  There is slight interval elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm as a result.  A granuloma is again noted in the left lung apex. 
 There is no displaced fracture.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Pectus excavatum
 deformity is again seen. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base atelectasis and slight elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm which are likely due to splinting.  If there is continuing
 concern for fracture, repeat dedicated views are recommended with a BB marker
 to mark the site of pain.
