                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral pleural effusions  // any
 interval change in pleural effusions?      any interval change in pleural
 effusions?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparisons to ___ at 20:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest radiograph ___ 08:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given differences in positioning, the moderate-sized bilateral effusions with
 associated bibasilar airspace opacities favoring atelectasis are likely not
 significantly changed.  However, there has been interval appearance of mild
 perihilar and interstitial edema.  The more rounded opacity in the left mid
 lung is stable.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult to assess due to the pleural
 effusions.
