                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with infra hilar infiltrate.  Now after antibiotic
 treatment.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___
 
 There is some broncho vascular crowding in the left infrahilar region, but I
 see no consolidation.  If symptoms persist, then CT scanning would be
 appropriate, but if the patient is asymptomatic, I do not believe that
 additional imaging is warranted at this time.  The lungs are otherwise
 entirely clear.  There is no pleural or contour abnormality of the
 cardiomediastinal hilar silhouette.
