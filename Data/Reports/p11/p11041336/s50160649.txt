                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a new dual-chamber pacemaker.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker with 2 leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  A right internal jugular catheter is seen.  There
 has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube.  There is stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes
 are decreased bilaterally.  There is mild, new pulmonary venous congestion
 bilaterally.  There is a new small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Subtle opacity at the right base reflects a probable, new,
 small right pleural effusion with adjacent minimal atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, minimal pulmonary venous congestion.  New, small left pleural effusion
 with a probable small right pleural effusion.
