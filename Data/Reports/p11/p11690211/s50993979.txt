  Relatively low lung volumes. Right greater than left bilateral pulmonary
  opacities with differential diagnosis including multifocal infection, fluid
  overload, pulmonary hemorrhage, underlying neoplastic process not excluded. 
  Possible mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. No prior from
  comparison.
  Follow-up chest CT would provide further assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, mild cough  // Eval for
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are
 seen, right greater than left, with differential diagnosis including
 multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage.  Right
 peritracheal and peribronchial/perihilar soft tissue opacity may be due to
 lymphadenopathy.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 Anchor screws project over the right humeral head from presumed prior rotator
 cuff repair.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes.  Right greater than left bilateral pulmonary
 opacities with differential diagnosis including multifocal infection, fluid
 overload, pulmonary hemorrhage, underlying neoplastic process not excluded. 
 Possible mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.  No prior from
 comparison.
 Follow-up chest CT would provide further assessment.
