                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral arm pain, questionable opacity over the right shoulder.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No evidence of parenchymal pathology at the level of the lung apices.
 The perithoracic soft tissues and bones appear normal.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Normal lung volumes.  No evidence of acute lung disease. 
 Decreased radiolucency at the left lung bases is likely caused by a
 pericardial fat pad.  No pneumothorax.  No osteodestructive lesions at the
 level of the shoulders.
