                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms and relative lucency within the lung apices
 compatible with underlying emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  On the lateral view, there is a patchy opacity identified in the
 lower lobe, possibly on the left, which could reflect an area of infection. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle opacity within the lower lobe on the lateral view, possibly within the
 left lower lobe.  This could reflect an area of developing infection in the
 correct clinical setting.
 
 Emphysema.
