                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Each hilum is enlarged and indistinct
 suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  Very small pleural effusions are
 suspected, particularly on the right.  Posterior basilar opacities are new,
 not specific, although most likely due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggest mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Suspected small pleural effusions and probable associated posterior
 atelectasis at the lung bases.
 
 Although no nodular opacity is persistently visualized in the left mid lung on
 this study, this does not negate the possibility of a pulmonary nodule as
 mentioned in the prior report.
