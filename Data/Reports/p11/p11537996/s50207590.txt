                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are patchy interstitial infiltrates bilaterally, most
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Some of the infiltrates are more
 confluent, particularly on the left, and superimposed infection is difficult
 to exclude.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy interstitial infiltrates likely represent mild pulmonary edema,
 though superimposed infection is difficult to exclude, particularly on the
 left.  Consider repeat radiograph after diuresis.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
