  1. Low lung volumes.  Basilar atelectasis.  No focal pneumonia.
  2. Multifocal osseous abnormalities involving several ribs, unchanged from
  prior, likely reflective of myelomatous involvement.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with multiple mylemoa on active chem p/w general maliase,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a slightly suboptimal inspiratory effort and low lung volumes. 
 Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 bilateral hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear, although subtle hazy
 opacity at the lung bases is likely reflective of crowding of bronchovascular
 structures in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is no focal lung
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Again seen are
 multifocal osseous abnormalities involving several bilateral ribs, likely
 reflecting myelomatous involvement, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Basilar atelectasis.  No focal pneumonia.
 2. Multifocal osseous abnormalities involving several ribs, unchanged from
 prior, likely reflective of myelomatous involvement.
