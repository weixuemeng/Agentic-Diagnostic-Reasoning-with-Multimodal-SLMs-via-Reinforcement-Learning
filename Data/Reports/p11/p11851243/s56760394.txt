 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:31 PM
  There is a persistent left apical pneumothorax, small in size, and unchanged
  since prior study.  There is also increased opacification at the left lung
  base, which likely reflects atelectasis, but a developing consolidation cannot
  be excluded.  There is persistent right basilar atelectasis.
