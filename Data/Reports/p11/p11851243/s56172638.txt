 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube placement for left ptx  // eval
 for ptx/ CT position      eval for ptx/ CT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___:27.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous moderate left pneumothorax has decreased substantially following
 insertion of a new basal thoracostomy tube.  Severe atelectasis persists at
 both lung bases.  Surprisingly, the previous moderate right pneumothorax is no
 longer evident.  Postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 has imp increased since earlier in the day, but this may be a function of
 lower lung volumes.  Upper lungs are clear.
