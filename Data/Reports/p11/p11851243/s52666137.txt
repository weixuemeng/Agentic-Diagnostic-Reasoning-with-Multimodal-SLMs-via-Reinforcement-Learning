                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent L PTX CT on WS  // evaluate for L
 PTX on water-seal PLEASE DO AT ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tiny left apical pneumothorax remains visible.  On the current exam, lucency
 seen in the left costophrenic angle is again noted --___ much of this is
 accounted for by a pneumothorax at this time is unclear.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema is probably similar to the prior study.  No right-sided pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 Atelectasis at the left base is similar, but probably slightly more
 pronounced.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is
 unchanged.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  The known calcified left ventricular aneurysm is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. A tiny left apical pneumothorax remains visible, grossly unchanged. 
 Lucency at the left costophrenic angle again noted.  Please see comment above.
 2. Possible minimal increase in left base atelectasis, but the overall
 appearance is similar.
