                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pains, evaluate for effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple median sternotomy wires are identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable.  Slight opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle likely reflects
 crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  Mild interstitial prominence, with prominent
 interlobular septa, is compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 is no frank pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  No effusions.
