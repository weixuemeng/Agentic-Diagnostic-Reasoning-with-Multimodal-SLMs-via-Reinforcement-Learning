                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution performed approximately
 five hours prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is an ill-defined opacity in
 the right lower lung region with apparent obscuration of the right heart
 margin, suggesting right middle lobe consolidation.  There is also
 consolidation along the right cardiophrenic angle.  Otherwise, there are
 increased interstitial opacities and Kerley B lines, most prominent in both
 lower lung regions.  Bilateral hilar engorgement is also apparent.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac sihouette is within normal
 limits.  The sternotomy wires are intact.  A prosthetic aortic valve is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema, which
 appears slightly improved compared with radiograph performed five hours prior.
 Consolidation in the right middle lobe might represent asymmetric edema vs
 pneumonia.
