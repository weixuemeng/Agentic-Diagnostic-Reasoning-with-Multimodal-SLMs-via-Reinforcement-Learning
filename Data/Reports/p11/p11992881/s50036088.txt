                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hip dislocation  // pre-op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation and positioning. Heart size is
 mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Calcification projecting over
 the to right apex is unchanged. Extensive degenerative changes are again
 demonstrated in the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study. Left basilar patchy opacity, likely atelectasis, but infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
