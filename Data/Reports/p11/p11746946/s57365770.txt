 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:40 A.M.

 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.

 opacification at the left base likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis
 secondary to a layering effusion.  A small right pleural effusion is also
 seen.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 2. Endotracheal tube lies 1.5 cm above the carina.  Pullback of 2 cm would be
