                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION; Status post extubation, to rule out aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are remarkable for persisting mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  The retrocardiac density has worsened reflecting an
 increased atelectasis in the left lower lung. Mild atelectasis in the right
 lower medial lung has also minimally worsened.  Pleural effusion if any is
 minimal on the right side and stable.  Heart size is mildly enlarged and
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persisting mild pulmonary edema and increased bilateral lower
 lung atelectasis.
