                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Relatively linear opacities in the right lung base are likely due to
 subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring.  No consolidation, pleural effusion,
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Linear lucency seen adjacent to the level
 of the ascending aorta is felt to be artifactual and represent air in the
 right mainstem bronchus rather than pneumomediastinum.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 18:20 on ___ via telephone.
