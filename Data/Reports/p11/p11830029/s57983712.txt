                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The pulmonary architecture appears somewhat
 irregular, which may reflect underlying pulmonary obstructive disease. 
 Streaky opacities in each costophrenic sulcus suggest minor scarring or
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  An expanded anteroposterior dimension of the chest
 suggests mild hyperinflation.  Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Findings which may suggest obstructive pulmonary disease, but no
 evidence for acute process.
