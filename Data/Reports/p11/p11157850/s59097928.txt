 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip
 approximately 3.3 cm from the carina, in appropriate position.  An enteric
 tube is seen with tip in the region of the gastric fundus side port likely in
 the distal esophagus.  Low inspiratory volume is seen.  Increased opacity at
 the right lung apex suggestive of right upper lobe collapse.  Elsewhere the
 lungs are grossly clear noting left basilar linear opacity suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe collapse.  Recommend repeat exam at some point to document
 re-expansion.
 
 Enteric tube is seen with tip at the gastric fundus, side port not visualized
 but likely in the distal esophagus and should be advanced for optimal
 positioning.
