                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:06 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New veil-like opacification at the base of the right chest could be pleural
 effusion, but I suspect new right lower lobe collapse because of mild
 rightward mediastinal shift. Atelectasis of the left lower lobe is also more
 pronounced.  Upper lungs are clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  ET tube in
 standard placement.  No pneumothorax.  Dr. ___ was paged.
