                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exams dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall, assess for intrathoracic injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low which limits evaluation.  Allowing for bronchovascular
 crowding, there is no overt consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is grossly within normal limits.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Old right rib cage deformities are unchanged from prior exam. 
 Compression deformities in the lower T-spine and upper lumbar spine appear
 stable from prior exam.  No definite acute bony injury.
