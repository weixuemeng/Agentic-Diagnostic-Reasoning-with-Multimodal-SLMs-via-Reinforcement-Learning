                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Posturing, intubated for airway protection, assess ET tube
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest provided.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube resides 1.2 cm above the carina.  Retraction by 1 to 2 cm is
 advised for more optimal positioning.  The NG tube is seen with its tip just
 beyond the GE junction and advancement would be recommended for more optimal
 positioning.  There is subtle perihilar opacity, which could reflect
 aspiration or mild congestion.  No supine evidence for effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size appears within normal limits.  Bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low-lying endotracheal tube for which retraction by 1 to 2 cm is
 advised.  NG tube should be advanced for more optimal positioning.  Perihilar
 opacity which could reflect mild edema or aspiration in the right clinical
 setting.
