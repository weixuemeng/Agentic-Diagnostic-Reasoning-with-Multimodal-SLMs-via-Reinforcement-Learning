                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and left lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Patchy medial right
 basilar opacity obscuring the right cardiophrenic sulcus suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus persists but is less
 striking than before.  Lungs appear hyperinflated.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax although a very small persistent left-sided
 effusion is hard to exclude.  Two calcified left lung nodules appear
 unchanged.  Streaky left mid lung opacities suggesting minor scarring are
 likewise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute process.
