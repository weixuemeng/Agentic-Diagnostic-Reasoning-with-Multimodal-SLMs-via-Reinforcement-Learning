                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for clearing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been almost complete
 clearing of the consolidation in the left mid and lower zones.  Some residual

 However, a repeat study in another month would be helpful to demonstrate
 complete clearing.
 
 The calcified nodule in the left lower zone and possible nodule in the left
 mid zone are again seen as on the CT of ___.
