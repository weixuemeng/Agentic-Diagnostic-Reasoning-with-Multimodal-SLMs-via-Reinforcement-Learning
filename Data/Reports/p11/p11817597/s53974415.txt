                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate no focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia.  Relative to prior study dated ___, cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable in appearance, within normal limits. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 thought likely secondary to atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild basilar atelectasis with no focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia.
