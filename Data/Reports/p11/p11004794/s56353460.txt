                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough for several weeks and history of prior
 lung cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 I do not see vascular clips at the hilus or resection ___ in the right
 lung, the right hemithorax is smaller than the left, and the perihilar right
 lung, particularly just superior to the hilus, has the appearance of localized
 radiation fibrosis.  Elevation of the right diaphragmatic pleural surface
 could be due to volume loss alone, but the contour suggests a small pleural
 effusion, with or without pleural thickening is present as well.  
 
 On the frontal view the mediastinal contours are normal, and the hila are not
 enlarged.  But on the lateral, there is mild prominence to the retrotracheal
 hilar region, usually formed by the left hilus but in this case, it is
 conceivably the summation of both hila and perihilar radiation fibrosis. 
 Comparison to prior chest radiographs would be required to detect change in
 this area and elsewhere in the chest.  Heart size is normal.  The entire left
 lung and periphery of the right lung are clear.
