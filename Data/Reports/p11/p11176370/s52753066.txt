                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart failure of unknown etiology and ___ 
 // pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right  IJ Swan-Ganz catheter similar in configuration.  Cardiomegaly is also
 grossly unchanged.   Please note that pericardial fluid would be difficult to
 exclude on this study.
 
 Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm suggestive of a small left effusion.  This is 
 similar to the film from 1 day earlier, but degree of increased retrocardiac
 density and obscuration of left hemidiaphragm has increased.  Also again seen
 is a right pleural effusion, now somewhat larger --  moderate in size -- and
 extending into the minor fissure, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Mild upper zone redistribution is not significantly changed.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, grossly unchanged.
 
 Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 Interval worsening of previously seen left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation,  probably with small left effusion.
