                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, rule out infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left chest pacer device with associated dual leads projecting in
 unchanged configuration.  There are low lung volumes, likely accentuating
 cardiac size.  Within this limitation, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged from prior chest x-ray from ___.  There is probably
 mild cardiomegaly.  Calcified pleural plaques most conspicuous at the right
 lung base, unchanged from prior exam.  There is diffuse, hazy right lung
 airspace opacity, all involving the right lower lobe most conspicuously. 
 Additional airspace opacities involving the left lung base obscure the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right more than left lower lobe airspace opacities are new from prior exam,
 and while this appearance may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 particularly in the setting of trace bilateral pleural effusions and mild
 cardiomegaly, this appearance could also represent multifocal infection. 
 Correlate with signs/symptoms and lab findings suggestive of infection.
 2. Calcified pleural plaques are unchanged.
