  Calcified pleural plaques. Although there is no prior to assess for interval
  change, there is suspected superimposed consolidation at the right lung base
  which could represent pneumonia. Correlation with prior exams would be helpful
  to assess for interval change. Followup will be necessary.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with productive cough, dyspnea  // evaluate for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are calcified pleural plaques particularly at the lung bases. Linear
 opacities  in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view is also suggestive
 of a calcified pleural plaque, likely localizing to the right mid/upper lung
 on the frontal view. There are some regions of opacity particularly at the
 right lung base medially which could represent a superimposed consolidation
 within the lungs. Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles on both sides
 may be due to chronic scarring versus small underlying effusions. Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size. Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Calcified pleural plaques.  Although there is no prior to assess for interval
 change, there is suspected superimposed consolidation at the right lung base
 which could represent pneumonia.  Correlation with prior exams would be
 helpful to assess for interval change. Followup will be necessary.
