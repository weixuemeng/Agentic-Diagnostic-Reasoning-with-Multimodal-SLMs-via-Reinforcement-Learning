                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia.  History of cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Left chest wall port
 is seen with catheter tip in the mid SVC.  There is subtle increased opacity
 in the infrahilar region on the left.  This could potentially be due to
 portable technique and poor inspiratory effort; however, is asymmetric. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased opacity in the infrahilar region on the left for
 which dedicated PA and lateral views are suggested to further characterize.
