 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)

 please evaluate for pneumothorax or other abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided. There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Subtle hazy opacity adjacent to the right heart
 border likely represents a epicardial fat in a setting of a mild pectus
 excavatum deformity. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
