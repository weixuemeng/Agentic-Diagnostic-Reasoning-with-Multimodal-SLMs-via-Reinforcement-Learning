 INDICATION:  ___F hx of etoh abuse s/p fall with TBI, SDH, SAH  and left
 sphenoid sinus fracture, possible L posterolateral orbital wall fx, L temporal
 bone fracture.  // dobhoff placement - would like to coordinate timing of XRay

 timing of XRay with PICC placement today
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ one.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New feeding tube with the wire stylet in place ends in the upper stomach. 
 Heart size top-normal.  Lungs essentially clear.  No pleural abnormality.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
