                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers with vomiting and Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia versus volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 worsening pulmonary edema which is mild to moderate.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are new since the prior study.  Increase in opacity at the right
 base may be vascular engorgement or developing concurrent pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal contour is enlarged since the prior study.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of pulmonary edema and enlargement of cardiac
 size with development of small bilateral pleural effusions indicative of heart
 failure. To adequately evaluate for concurrent infection particularly in the
 right base, follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
