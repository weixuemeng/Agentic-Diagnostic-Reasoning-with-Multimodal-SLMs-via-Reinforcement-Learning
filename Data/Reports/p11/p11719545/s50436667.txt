                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM: Large transfusion, GI bleed, COPD, status post prior partial
 lobectomy.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.  Cardiac size is top
 normal.  There is evidence of surgery in the left lung with multiple surgical
 chains and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Right lower lobe opacities
 are likely atelectasis.  There is minimal thorax or pleural effusion.  The
 right upper lobe is hyperexpanded suggesting the presence of COPD.  The left
 hilum has an unusual appearance this could be due to prior surgery, but
 comparison to prior studies would be helpful to assess for any change.  There
 is if any very mild interstitial edema.
