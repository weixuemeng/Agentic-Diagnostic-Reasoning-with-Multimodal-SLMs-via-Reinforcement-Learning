                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of colectomy and AVMs.  Admitted for
 GI bleed and new fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Hyperinflation and bullous transformation in the upper lungs, particularly the
 right, indicate emphysema.  A new small area of irregular opacification in the
 anterior segment of the right upper lobe is consistent with pneumonia.  A
 second region of peribronchial infiltration at the left apex is stable,
 probably scarring, perhaps due to previous tuberculosis.  Interstitial
 abnormality at both lung bases is of uncertain chronicity, could be a chronic
 change.  Enlargement and nodularity of the left hilus is also of uncertain
 age, as well as significance.  Older chest radiograph should be obtained to
 see whether further analysis with CT scanning is justified at this time.
 
 Heart size is normal and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.
