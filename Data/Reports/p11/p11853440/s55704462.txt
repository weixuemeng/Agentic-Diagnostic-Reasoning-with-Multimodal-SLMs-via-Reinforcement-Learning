                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is opacification of the left lower lobe consistent with atelectasis and
 less likely infection.  There is a focal opacity in the left mid lung which
 most likely represents loculated fluid along the major fissure.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is identified and unchanged from the prior study.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular redistribution, edema or pleural effusion seen.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis and a focal opacity in the left mid lung which
 most likely represents loculated fluid in the major fissure.
