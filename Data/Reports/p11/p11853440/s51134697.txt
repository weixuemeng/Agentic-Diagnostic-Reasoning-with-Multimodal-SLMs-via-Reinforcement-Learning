                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent CABG, presents with chest pain
 and shortness of breath, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.  A nodular opacity in the
 left mid lung is less conspicuous than on prior exam and could represent a
 focus of scarring, though a CT may be obtained to further characterize if it
 is not completely resolved on followup exams.  There are bibasilar opacities,
 most compatible with bronchovascular crowding given the low lung volumes.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable, reflective of a somewhat unfolded thoracic
 aorta.  The bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with lower lung opacities most compatible with
 bronchovascular crowding.  Left mid lung nodular opacity is less conspicuous. 
 Recommend continued followup to resolution.  If this opacity does not resolve,
 a CT should be obtained.
