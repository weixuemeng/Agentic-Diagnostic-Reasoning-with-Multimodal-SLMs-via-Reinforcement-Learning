                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chills, headache today.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally slightly hyperexpanded.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no definite evidence of
 pneumonia.  The heart is exaggerated by AP technique and likely top normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact. 
 Anterior cervical fusion hardware is incompletely evaluated on this study. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis, but no convincing evidence of pneumonia. 
 2. Mild hyperexpansion of the lung may reflect COPD.
