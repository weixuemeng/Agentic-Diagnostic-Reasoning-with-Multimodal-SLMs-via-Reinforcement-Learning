 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained on ___.
 
 The post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasal atelectasis, overall
 unchanged.  Multiple compression fractures demonstrated on the lateral view
 are noted, progressed with progression of one of the mid thoracic vertebral
