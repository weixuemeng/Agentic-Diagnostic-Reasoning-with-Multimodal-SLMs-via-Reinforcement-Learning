                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a history ___ ___'s Disease   multiple prior
 ischemic strokes with subsequent deficits in cognitive impairment,
 word-finding difficulty, R lower facial droop   L-sided weakness, who
 presented to OSH with potential seizure activity, unresponsiveness, and
 emesis, who upon transfer to ___ was thought to have seizure and possible
 aspiration pneumonitis  // NGT placement in stomach
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 11:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube is coiled in the proximal stomach, with tip in the gastric
 cardia.  Shallow inspiration accentuates heart size, pulmonary vascularity. 
 Interstitial prominence has improved since prior exam.  Prominent right
 lateral chest skin fold.  There are small pleural effusions, stable on the
 left, more apparent on the right.  Bibasilar opacities, worsened on the right,
 may represent atelectasis, consider pneumonitis in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved interstitial prominence, likely improving edema.
 Worsened left basilar opacity, may represent atelectasis, consider pneumonitis
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
