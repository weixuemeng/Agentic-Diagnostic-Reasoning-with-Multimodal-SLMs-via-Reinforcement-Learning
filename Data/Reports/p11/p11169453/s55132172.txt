                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Substernal chest congestion.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are slightly increased lung markings, more so on the left than on the
 right, which may be related to pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly within normal limits.
 There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is relatively unchanged
 since the prior examination.
 
 There are deformities of left-sided ribs related to old, healed fractures. 
 Degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joints are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild prominence and crowding of vascular structures primarily on the left
 suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion or mild edema.  No clear
 consolidative process is present.
