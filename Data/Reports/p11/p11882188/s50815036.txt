                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are somewhat hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Right-sided
 chest deformity is again seen.  Patchy left base opacity is grossly stable
 over prior studies, most likely due to atelectasis.  No pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  A tubular structure/drain is partially
 imaged overlying the right abdomen.
