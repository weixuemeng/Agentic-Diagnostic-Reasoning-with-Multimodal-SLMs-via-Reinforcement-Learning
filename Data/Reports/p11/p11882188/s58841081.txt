                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and URI symptoms, history of pancreatic cancer,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 left lower lobe opacity, which could represent a very early pneumonia. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures appear intact. 
 Partially imaged tubing in the bilateral upper abdomen likely reflect
 nephrostomy tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the left lower lobe could represent a very
 early pneumonia.
