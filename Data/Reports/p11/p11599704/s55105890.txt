                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The right apex is obscured
 by the patient's neck and chin.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No
 focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or left-sided pneumothorax is
 identified.  Remote fracture of the right third rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment of the right apex.  Low lung volumes with patchy opacities
 in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
