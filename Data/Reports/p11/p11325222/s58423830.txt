                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The first and third
 wires from the top are fractured.  The cardiac silhouette size remains
 moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is mild upper
 zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities may reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
