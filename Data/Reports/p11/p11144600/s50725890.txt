                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:30 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multifocal pneumonia, assess interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Substantial improvement in opacification in both lungs is due to at least
 decrease in moderate pulmonary edema.  The heterogeneous almost nodular
 abnormality in the right lung is probably residual of pneumonia and when
 compared to ___, before the patient was in pulmonary edema, is somewhat
 better at the lung base, less so in the right mid and upper lung zones.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions have improved.  Heart is normal size but pulmonary
 vasculature is still severely engorged.
 
 Transsubclavian right ventricular pacer lead is sharply angulated, an unusual
 orientation due to marked left ventricular enlargement and rotation
 counterclockwise of the interventricular septum.
