                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, question improvement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Examination as originally submitted as the sides reversed.  The pacemaker
 power pack is in the left anterior chest wall.
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved.  Lung nodules throughout both
 lungs continue to enlarge in size and number, relative to ___.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions have decreased.  Consolidation in the right upper
 lobe is stable.  Aeration in the right lower lobe has minimally improved. 
 Heart size is normal.  ET tube in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Pacer lead ends in the right
 heart, perhaps the atrium, but has not migrated appreciably over the past
 several days.  Overall, findings are most readily explained by extensive
 multifocal pneumonia, predominantly in the right lung, and progressive septic
 emboli in all lobes.
