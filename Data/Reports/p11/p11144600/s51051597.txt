                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Worsening diffuse airspace opacities
 in the right lung may reflect an evolving infectious pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also
 present as well as interstitial edema and a moderate right pleural effusion.
