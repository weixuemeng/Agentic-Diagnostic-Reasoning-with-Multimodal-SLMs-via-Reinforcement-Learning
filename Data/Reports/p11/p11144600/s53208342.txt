 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of one week of productive cough, assessment for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change. 
 A zone of minimally increased density at the right lung base is completely
 unchanged as compared to the prior image, both on the frontal and on the
 lateral view.  No other parenchymal opacities are noted.  Thus, there is no
 evidence of recent pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
