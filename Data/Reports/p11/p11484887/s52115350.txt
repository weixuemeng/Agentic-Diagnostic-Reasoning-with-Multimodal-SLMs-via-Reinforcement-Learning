                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible left scapular fracture after fall, left back pain, now
 requiring assessment for pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with left shoulder and scapular radiographs
 from ___, ___ and chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute fracture or dislocation is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  No acute fracture or dislocation detected, however conventional chest
 radiographs are not sensitive in detecting chest cage trauma.  If the patient
 has focal findings, bone detail views should be performed of those areas.
