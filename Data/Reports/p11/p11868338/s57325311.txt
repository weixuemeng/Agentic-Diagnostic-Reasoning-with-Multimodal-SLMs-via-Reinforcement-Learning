                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with persistent cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  In comparison to prior technically limited study,
 there is new density projecting over the left base though this appears to
 reflect crowding of the pulmonary vasculature in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  There is no significant change from prior study including no
 convincing evidence of pneumonia.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs remain otherwise well aerated.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged, with mild cardiomegaly exaggerated by low lung volumes.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change from prior study including no convincing
 evidence of pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature, though if there is ongoing concern for infection,
 follow-up radigraphs could be obtained.
