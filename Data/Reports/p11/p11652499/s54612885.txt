                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sepsis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Correlation is made to previous
 exam from  ___.
 
 There is stable left basilar opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm,
 potentially due to any combination of effusion and atelectasis or
 consolidation.  Linear opacity at the right lung base is suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Tracheostomy tube is in stable position.  Cardiac silhouette is
 stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Left basilar opacity,
 potentially due to atelectasis, effusion; however, consolidation from
 infection is not excluded.
