                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea.  Question aspiration versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been increased opacity at both lung
 bases.  Opacity at the right lung base is linear and is most consistent with
 atelectasis.  Opacity at the left lung base is less linear and may represent
 consolidation secondary to aspiration or pneumonia.  There is blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle which has increased consistent with pleural effusion. 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in good position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with right lower lobe atelectasis, left
 pleural effusion, and left lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia and/or
 aspiration.
