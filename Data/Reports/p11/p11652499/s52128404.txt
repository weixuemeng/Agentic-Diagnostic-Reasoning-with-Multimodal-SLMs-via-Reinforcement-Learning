                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with complex medical history with
 tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 The tracheostomy is in standard position.  Lung volumes are very low,
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Atelectasis is seen at the right lung
 base.  There is no large pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute intrathoracic
 process.
