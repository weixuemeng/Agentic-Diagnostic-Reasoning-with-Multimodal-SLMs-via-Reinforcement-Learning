                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Balloon dilatation for subglottic stenosis, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Scattered radiation related to the size of the
 patient somewhat obscures fine detail.  However, there is no evidence of
 post-procedure pneumothorax.  The lower cervical trachea appears to be
 somewhat narrower than usually expected.  No evidence of pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.
