                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  Liver failure.  Dobbhoff placement, assessment requested.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new Dobbhoff tube terminates in the stomach.  The lung volumes
 are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  In
 addition to a spread background fine reticular abnormality, greater on the
 left than right, which appears similar to somewhat increased, a newfocal
 consolidation is present in the right mid lung.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New nasogastric tube with weighted tip, terminating in the
 stomach.  New consolidation developing in the right lung.  Persistent and
 increased diffuse interstitial abnormality most suggestive of moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
