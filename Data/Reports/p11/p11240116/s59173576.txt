                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and altered mental status, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extremely low lung volumes could account for opacification of the
 lung bases, greater on the right, due to atelectasis as well as mild
 engorgement of pulmonary vasculature.  A small right pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected, however there is a crescent of
 lucency in the left diaphragmatic region that I discussed with Dr ___ ___
 said pneumoperitoneum is excluded clinically . The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  Partially imaged
 spinal fusion hardware is noted at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis. No likely pneumonia or edema.
 
 ___ (In Hospital, On Page), ___ and I discussed these findings at
 8:30am, ___.
