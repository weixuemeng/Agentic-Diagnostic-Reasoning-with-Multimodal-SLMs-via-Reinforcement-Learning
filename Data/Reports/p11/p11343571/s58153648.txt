                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Neutropenia and fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for questionable nodule in the left apex that could also potentially be
 a bone island within the first rib.  For precise assessment of this area,
 lordotic view is recommended.  No focal consolidation to suggest infectious
 process is present.
