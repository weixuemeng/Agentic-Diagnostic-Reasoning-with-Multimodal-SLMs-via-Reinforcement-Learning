 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The lung volumes are low.  There is a
 patchy left basilar opacity that appears unchanged and is likely due to minor
 atelectasis or scarring, probably within the lingula.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.  There has been no significant change aside from
 removal of a venous catheter.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
