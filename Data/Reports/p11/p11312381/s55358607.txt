                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia in a patient with systemic lupus
 erythematous and end-stage renal disease, on immunosuppressive therapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent ___ and CT
 chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  Mid left lung and bilateral basilar linear opacities are
 unchanged since ___ and likely represent scarring.  Unchanged low lung
 volumes likely represent chronic volume loss due to scarring.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
