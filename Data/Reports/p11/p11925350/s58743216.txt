                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, assess tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 semi upright portable chest radiographs were obtained separated
 by 6 minutes. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is satisfactorily positioned on the second of
 the 2 images, 3 cm above the carina.  On the first image, the nasogastric tube
 curls within the mid esophagus terminating cranially out of view but was
 repositioned before the second image to terminate within the stomach.  The
 lungs are low in volume on both images without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax with mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  The heart is top
 normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of lines and tubes with low lung volumes.
