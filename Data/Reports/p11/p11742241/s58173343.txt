                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unresponsive, intubated, assess for acute process and
 position of tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  2 supine portable AP chest radiographs were obtained during
 placement of the endotracheal tube approximately 16 minutes apart. The first
 film demonstrates right mainstem intubation with complete whiteout of the left
 lung.  The second film was obtained 16 minutes later shows retraction of the
 endotracheal tube with its tip now positioned approximately 1.4 cm above the
 carina.  There is interval expansion of the left lung.  The NG tube resides in
 the left upper abdomen with its tip positioned only approximately 5 cm beyond
 the GE junction.  Advancement of the NG tube may result in more optimal
 positioning.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. 
 No bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low position of ET tube positioned 1.4 cm above the carina.  Please
 retract by at least 1 cm for more optimal positioning.  
 2.  NG tube tip just beyond the GE junction and can be advanced for more
 optimal positioning.  
 3.  Aerated lungs post retraction of ET tube.
