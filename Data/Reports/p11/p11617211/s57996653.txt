                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough, tube feedings, assess for aspiration.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the
 projection and low lung volumes.  Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe
 could be atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be totally excluded.  Faint
 opacity in the left perihilar region could also represent aspiration.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
