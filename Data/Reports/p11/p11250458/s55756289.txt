                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AMS, stroke evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung volumes are
 low with bronchovascular crowding likely accounting for the subtle opacities
 in the lower lungs.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.  Crowding of bronchovasculature likely
 accounts for the subtle lower lung opacities.
