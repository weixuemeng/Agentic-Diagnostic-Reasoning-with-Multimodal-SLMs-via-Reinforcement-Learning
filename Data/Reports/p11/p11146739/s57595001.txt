                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  There are subtle lateral and left mid lung patchy opacities which
 are nonspecific, but could be due to underlying infection or contusion.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and mechanical fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are coarse interstitial markings bilaterally, which could be
 due to underlying edema versus chronic lung disease, less likely atypical
 infection; correlate clinically.  There is prominence of the right hilum and
 to a lesser extent the left hilum which may be due to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Prominence of the right hilum may be due to combination of
 vascular structures; however, underlying consolidation or lymphadenopathy may
 be present.  There is bibasilar scarring/atelectasis.  Costochondral
 calcifications are seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  High-riding bilateral humeral head suggests rotator
 cuff disease.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion,
 although trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.
