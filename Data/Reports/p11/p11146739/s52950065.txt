                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardia  // evidence of infection or
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Limited examination secondary to patient motion. Within this limitation,
 moderate cardiomegaly has slightly progressed from the prior examination in
 ___. Subtle, diffuse interstitial markings are stable from the prior
 examination, and likely reflect underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.
 There is no large pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive, now moderate cardiomegaly. Diffuse interstitial abnormality,
 similar to prior, compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease. If
 symptoms persist, repeat chest radiographs can be performed.
