                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F presenting with cough, rhinorrhea, and possible
 shingles rash.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 10:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance is
 re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 prominence of the hila again noted bilaterally.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
