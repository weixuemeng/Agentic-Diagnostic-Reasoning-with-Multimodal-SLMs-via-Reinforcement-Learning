                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed to multiple prior
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum remain stable with mild cardiomegaly.  The lung
 volumes are low.  The PA view reflects no abnormality.  The lateral view
 demonstrates suspected small amount of pleural effusion as well as
 retrocardiac opacity most likely in the left lower lobe that potentially might
 reflect pneumonia.  Followup of the patient four weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy is recommended.
