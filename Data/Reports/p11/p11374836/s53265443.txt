                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Vagal nerve stimulator battery change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Low lung volumes explain bronchovascular crowding, but make it difficult to
 exclude mild interstitial edema.  It also is likely responsible for
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe simulating consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 low lung volume.  Electrode passes from the left low pectoral power pack to
 the left paraspinal neck.
