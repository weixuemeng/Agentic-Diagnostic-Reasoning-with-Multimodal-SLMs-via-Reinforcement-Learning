                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 22:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:   ___-year-old with new hypoxia and shortness of breath
 after thoracentesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:18.
 
 Single AP upright chest film ___ at 22:40 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right basilar pigtail catheter with decrease in
 size of a right pleural effusion.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although
 there are several lucencies in the right medial lung which could reflect
 loculated air.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is some coarsening of the interstitium,
 particularly at the right apex, which appears to be chronic and may reflect
 underlying interstitial disease or possibly prior granulomatous infection. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall, this does not appear to be
 significantly changed since ___.  The heart remains enlarged.
