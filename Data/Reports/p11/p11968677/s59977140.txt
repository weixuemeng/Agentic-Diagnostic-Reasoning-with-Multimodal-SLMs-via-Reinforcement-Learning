                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Coarsened lung
 markings with widened AP diameter of the chest suggests underlying fibrosis
 and/or emphysema.  There is no prior study to assess the stability of this
 finding.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour appears grossly
 unremarkable, though faint atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic
 knob noted.  There are two levels of thoracic wedge compression deformities in
 the mid to lower T-spine.  Otherwise, the imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarsened interstitial lung markings which likely reflect chronic
 lung disease/fibrosis.  Clinically, no definite signs of pneumonia.
