                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Once again lung volumes are very low, but aside from subsegmental atelectasis,
 there is no focal pulmonary abnormality.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Indentation on the left side of the upper trachea is more
 likely a vascular indentation than due to an adjacent mass or even thyroid
 nodule.  A prominent first costosternal junction should not be mistaken for a
 lung nodule, particularly when compared to chest radiograph on ___ when
 there is no suggestion of a lung nodule.
