                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p OPCAB  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is unchanged approximately 5.6 cm from the carina.  Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in the junction of the main and right pulmonary arteries.  Lung
 volumes remain quite low.  Mild cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema are
 unchanged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis, left greater than right, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No significant change including persistent moderate pulmonary edema and
 mild cardiomegaly.  A superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to detect in
 the setting of pulmonary edema.  Recommend repeat imaging after diuresis.
 2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, is unchanged.
