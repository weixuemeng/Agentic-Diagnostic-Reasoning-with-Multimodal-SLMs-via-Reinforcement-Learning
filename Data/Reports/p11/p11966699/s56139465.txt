                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left-sided
 AICD is stable in position.  The cardiac silhouette remains mild to moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Subtle linear left basilar
 opacities are improved since the prior study and likely represent chronic
 changes.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
