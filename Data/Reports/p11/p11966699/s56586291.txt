                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ventricular tachycardia, chest pain,
 evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal upright view of the chest is provided. 
 Left-sided AICD is stable in position.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 to markedly enlarged, appears increased in size as compared to the prior study
 given differences in technique. he mediastinal contours are relatively stable.
 In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is increased perihilar
 opacification with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema.  Vascular markings also accentuated by low lung volumes.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are given haziness of the diaphragms.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires and numerous surgical clips are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  In comparison to the prior study, the lung volumes are low resulting in
 pulmonary vascular crowding.  However, there is increased perihilar
 interstitial prominence with less well defined vascular markings suggestive of
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  Moderate to marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appears
 increased, given differences in technique. Likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
