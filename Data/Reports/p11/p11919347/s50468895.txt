 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, intubation,
 questionable changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices are constant, including the
 Swan-Ganz catheter.  The Swan-___ catheter, however, needs to be pulled back
 by approximately 2-3 cm, as the tip is relatively far advanced in the right
 pulmonary artery.
 
 Minimally improved ventilation of the lung apices.  However, substantial
 pleural effusions and signs of moderate pulmonary edema persist bilaterally. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
