                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe heart failure, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:16 a.m., no significant change is detected.
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, with upper zone re-istribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is confluent opacity at the
 right base and in the lower portion of the right mid zone, which could
 represent a combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is also increased retrocardiac density ,consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Some more focal patchy opacity
 in left midzone could represent either interstitial edema related to CHF or an
 area of focal infiltrate.  
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Incidental note made of right upper quadrant surgical clips.
 Probable thoracolumbar scoliosis.
