                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 22:35.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF on Lasix with acute respiratory
 distress.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:39.
 
 A single portable upright chest film ___ at 22:35 was obtained.  These
 are the best possible images obtained in this patient given his current
 clinical condition.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A left-sided pacer remains in place, likely unchanged, although the distal
 portion of both leads is not well seen due to differences in technique.  The
 patient's mandible obscures the right lung apex.  Lung volumes are low and
 there are likely bilateral effusions, right greater than left which are likely
 not significantly changed.  Overall, the degree of pulmonary edema is stable. 
 The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  No pneumothorax is seen given the limitations of this examination.
