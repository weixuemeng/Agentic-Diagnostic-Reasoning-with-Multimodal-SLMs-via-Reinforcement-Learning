                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, increasing dyspnea post-intubation
 and orogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip
 approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen at least to
 just below the level of the diaphragm but the tip is not identified.  A
 dual-lead left-sided pacer is again seen with the right atrial lead in
 appropriate position and the tip of the right ventricular lead not included on
 the image.  Overall, there is slight improvement in aeration at both lung
 bases.  There are persistent, right greater than left, pleural effusions with
 moderate pulmonary edema with associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis
 and/or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 remains enlarged, likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Overall stable mediastinal contours.
