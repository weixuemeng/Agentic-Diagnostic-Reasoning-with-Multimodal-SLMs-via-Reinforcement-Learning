                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs from the same day and chest CT dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but it only passes
 beyond the hemidiaphragm by about 6 cm and it may be appropriate to advance it
 further to secure optimal drainage.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  No free air is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach.  Advancing the tube
 is recommended, however, to obtain optimal drainage.
