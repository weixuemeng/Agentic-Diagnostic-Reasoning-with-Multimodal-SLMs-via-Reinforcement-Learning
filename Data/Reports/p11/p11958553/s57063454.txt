  subcutaneous emphysema within right chest wall. bilateral low lung vol with
  crowding of bronchovascular markings. widened mediastinum may be related to

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy, postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with
 evidence of esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  Nasogastric tube tip is
 at the level of the carina.  There is some indistinctness of engorged
 pulmonary vessels.  It is unclear whether this represents elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure or is merely a manifestation of low lung volumes.
 
 Right chest tube is in place without pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas is seen
 along the chest wall on the lower and the upper abdomen.  Bibasilar
 atelectatic changes are noted.
