 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post minimal invasive esophagectomy, ___. 
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Widened mediastinum is stable. 
 Small right effusions with adjacent atelectasis have minimally improved. 
 Linear and reticular opacities in the hila bilaterally, worse in the left, are
 consistent with bronchiectasis.
