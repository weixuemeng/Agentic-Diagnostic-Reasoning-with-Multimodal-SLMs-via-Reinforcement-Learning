                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with increased seizure frequency  // Eval for evidence of PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is a vague asymmetric
 opacity projecting over the left lung base best appreciated on the frontal
 view which in the correct clinical setting could represent a very early
 pneumonia versus atelectasis.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of
 edema or congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle vague opacity at the left lung base could represent a very early
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
