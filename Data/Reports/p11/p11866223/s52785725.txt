                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, though there may be some background
 hyperinflation.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged.  There is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated due to low
 inspiratory volumes.  There is atelectasis at both lung bases.  No focal
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.  Slight prominence of the
 paratracheal soft tissues likely relates to low inspiratory volumes and body
 habitus.
