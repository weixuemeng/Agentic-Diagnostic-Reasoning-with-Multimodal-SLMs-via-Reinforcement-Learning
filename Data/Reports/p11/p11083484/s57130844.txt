 INDICATION:  Elevated calcium and vitamin D.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report from chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded with left
 apical thickening, likely a sequela of prior radiation treatment.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Surgical
 clips in the left axilla are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiopulmonary process to explain elevated calcium and
 vitamin D.
