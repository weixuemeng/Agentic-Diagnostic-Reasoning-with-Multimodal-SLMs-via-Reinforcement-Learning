                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, cough, and right-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating heart size.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  Bronchial cuffing
 and diffuse prominent interstitial markings suggest an interstitial
 abnormality, possibly bronchitis.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality compatible with bronchitis. 
 Followup chest radiograph indicated if symptoms persist more than two weeks.
