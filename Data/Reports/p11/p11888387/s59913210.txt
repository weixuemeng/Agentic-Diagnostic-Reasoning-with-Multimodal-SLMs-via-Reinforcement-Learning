                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there are bilateral perihilar opacities, which may be due to edema, although
 infectious process is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with the leads extending to the
 expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bilateral perihilar opacity which could
 relate to edema, however, infection may be present.
