                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Attempted aborted IJ attempt.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___ at 22:24 p.m.
 
 Soft tissues of the patient's neck obscure the uppermost lung apices. 
 Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is detected on either side.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over
 right atrium and right ventricle.Mild prominence of cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, which
 could reflect an element of CHF.  There is patchy opacity in the right
 mid/upper zone, with upward bowing of the minor fissure suggesting some volume
 loss in the right upper zone, together with an apparent focal upper lobe
 infiltrate.  There is patchy retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A small left effusion is likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  Opacities in (i) the right upper lobe with slight
 volume loss and (ii) the left lower lobe with a small effusion.
