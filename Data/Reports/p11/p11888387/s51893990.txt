                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, rule out CHF.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 2:37 p.m.
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, the patient is more kyphotic on the
 current exam, with lower lung volumes.  However, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and opacities in the right upper zone and left base are grossly
 similar.  Small left-greater-than-right effusions noted.  The small right
 effusion is new or slightly larger on today's exam.  Left-sided pacemaker with
 leads over right atrium or right ventricle noted.  Mild upper zone
 redistribution and probably some background pulmonary vascular plethora is
 also similar to prior.  Please note that the right upper zone opacity, though
 similar to the most recent prior film, is new compared with ___ and could
 represent a new superimposed pneumonic infiltrate. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Mild CHF, similar to prior. Small b/l effusions, with the right effusion
 new or slightly larger.
 
 2) Right upper zone and LLL opacities.  The ddx includes pneumonic infiltates.
