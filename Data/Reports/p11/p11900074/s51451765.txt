  Interval retraction of the endotracheal tube, which now terminates 5.6 cm
  above the level of the carina.  Marked interval progression of pulmonary edema
  in a short time interval, in keeping with the history of drowning.

 INDICATION:  Status post drowning, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously malpositioned endotracheal tube is repositioned and
 the tip now projects 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is in unchanged
 position, the course is normal.  Newly developed massive bilateral
 predominantly perihilar parenchymal opacities with a consolidation component
 and a small peripheral opacity component containing air bronchograms.  There
 also are smaller peripheral parenchymal opacities throughout the lung
 parenchyma.  The image suggests a combination of acute cardiogenic and,
 potentially, vascular permeability edema.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
