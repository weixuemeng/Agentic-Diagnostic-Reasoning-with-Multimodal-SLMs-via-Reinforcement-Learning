                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tracheostomy and recent pneumonia presenting
 with worsening respiratory status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  Right-sided PICC
 is seen with tip likely in the proximal right atrium.  Indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings are seen compatible with mild congestion.  There is no
 evidence of frank pulmonary edema.  There is blunting of the lateral
 costophrenic angles, potentially due to technique and overlying soft tissues,
 although small effusions are also possible.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
