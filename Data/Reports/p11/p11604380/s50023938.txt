                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:12 A.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma.  Evaluate pulmonary
 complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pneumoperitoneum, attributable to PEG placement, although the PEG catheter is
 not discernible, is smaller today than on ___.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened accounting for progressive
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm above a distended gastric fundus or
 splenic flexure.
 
 Right lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal bulge in the region
 of the tip of the left PIC line is more pronounced today than it has been in
 the recent past, with the exception of ___.  I believe this is a distended
 mediastinal vein, rather than anything more significant.
