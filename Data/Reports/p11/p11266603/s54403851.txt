                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right thoracentesis with subsequent
 hypoxemia.  // eval for change in right lung field - ? re-expansion pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The entire right hemithorax is opacified, largely due to pleural effusion, but
 there is also a component of underlying pulmonary edema and atelectasis.  This
 is a dramatic change compared to the prior radiograph performed yesterday
 evening, which suggests re-expansion pulmonary edema. The left lung is
 essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax. Left heart border is
 unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities. The VP shunt is unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant worsening opacification of the entire right hemithorax, suggesting
 re-expansion pulmonary edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.
