                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion.  ICD placement recently.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to AP chest on ___ and prior
 PA and lateral ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild, but persistent.  Relative enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette compared to ___ suggests some increase in
 moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  If there is pericardial
 effusion it is probably not hemodynamically significant but that determination
 would require echocardiography.  Small right pleural effusion which increased
 between ___ and ___ is stable.  A left pleural abnormality
 could be due to a combination of pleural thickening and small effusion, is
 unchanged since ___.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is
 unchanged in position, tip projecting over the floor of the right ventricle
 close to the anticipated location of the apex.  No pneumothorax.
