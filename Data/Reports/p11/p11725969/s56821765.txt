  Interval decrease in size of cardiac silhouette status post pericardial window
  which still remains prominently enlarged.  A left apical chest tube is in
  place without pneumothorax.  There has been significant improvement in
  bilateral pleural effusions with small amount of remnant fluid.  Heterogeneous
  opacities in the bilateral lower lung fields likely represents a mixture of
  atelectasis and re-expansion edema.  Mild fluid overload remains.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pericardial windowing, evaluation for interval change
 and chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 pericardial windowing, an according device is in situ.  Moreover, bilateral
 chest tubes have been placed, that led to substantial decrease in extent of
 the pre-existing pleural effusions.  The chest tubes are correctly positioned,
 there is a millimetric left-sided pneumothorax as manifested by a linear
 lucency along the left cardiac border.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette has mildly decreased; however, it is still
 moderately enlarged and areas of reexpansion edema and atelectasis are seen at
 both lung bases.  No evidence of tension.
