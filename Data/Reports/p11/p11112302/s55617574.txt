                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with GI bleeding, wheezing, history of CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Heart size is moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible
 with mild pulmonary edema.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally also suggests
 dilated pulmonary arteries.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis is
 noted.  No large pneumothorax is seen however the medial aspect of both lung
 apices is obscured by the patient's chin and neck projecting over this area. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions appear to be present.  There are moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
