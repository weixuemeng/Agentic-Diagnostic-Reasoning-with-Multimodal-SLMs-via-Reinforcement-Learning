                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated to the right in the patient's chin overlies the lung
 apices, partially obscuring the view.  Given the above, there is likely a
 small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild to moderate interstitial
 edema.  More focal right upper to mid lung opacity is not well assessed due to
 patient positioning, could be due to consolidation due to pneumonia.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to patient rotation in patient's chin overlying the medial
 lung apices.  Given this, small right pleural effusion.  Mild to moderate
 interstitial edema.  Right upper to mid lung opacity is not well assessed, but
 could be due to consolidation due to pneumonia.
