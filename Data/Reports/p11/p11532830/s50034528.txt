                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for 2 weeks with a history of sarcoidosis.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Severe end stage changes from sarcoidosis are seen, predominantly in
 the upper lungs.  Increased opacification at the left lung base is impossible
 to discern pneumonia from different inspiratory effort.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Extensive end stage fibrosis from sarcoid limits sensitivity for
 detecting pneumonia.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:55 on ___
 by telephone at the time of interpretation.
