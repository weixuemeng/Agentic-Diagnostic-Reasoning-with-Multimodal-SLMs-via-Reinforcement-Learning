                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS, to assess for pneumothorax and effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest
 tube remains in place.  However, there appears to be a pleural line and in
 absence of vessels in the upper portion of the right lung, is worrisome for
 pneumothorax.
