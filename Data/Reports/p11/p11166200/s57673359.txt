                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pulmonary nodules status post
 right VATS, upper lobe wedge resection, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size remains
 normal.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.
 The pulmonary vasculature again does not demonstrate any congestive pattern
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid
 accumulation.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area on the frontal
 view.  In comparison with the next preceding chest examination the at that
 time visible pulmonary abnormalities seen in the right upper lobe area
 laterally and in contact with the pleura as well as similar changes in the
 left base have clearly regressed.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are
 present.  No remaining abnormality at the site of the previously performed
 wedge resection in the right upper lobe area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of previously identified multiple scattered
 nodular parenchymal densities in the lungs in this patient with a complex
 history of waxing and waning pulmonary abnormalities, possibly explained by
 sarcoidosis.
