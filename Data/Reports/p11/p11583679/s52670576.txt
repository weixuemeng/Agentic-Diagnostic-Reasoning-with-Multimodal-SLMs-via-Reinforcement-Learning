                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with decreased breath sounds in left mid and
 lower lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggesting chronic pulmonary disease.  No
 evidence of cardiomegaly, vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 There is a vague asymmetry in opacification in the mid zone, more prominent on
 the left.  This could represent a region of consolidation, though it is not
 confirmed on the lateral view.
