                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman newly tranfered from OSH s/p PEA arrest with
 hypoxemic respiratory failure, ?CHF, liver and renal failure, intubated with R
 L central access  // please evaluate for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube tip lies approximately is 6.1 cm above the carina, below the level
 of the clavicular heads.  .  An NG tube is present, tip overlying the stomach.
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Prominence of the mediastinal silhouette is
 noted, but could relate to vascular structures and supine positioning.  Upper
 zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring is compatible CHF and inter,
 stitial edema.  Hazy opacity at the right base could represent a small to
 moderate layering pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The left costophrenic sulcus is
 grossly clear.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as described.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly.
 3. Increased upper zone vasculature and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.
 4. Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, with probable layering right
 effusion.
