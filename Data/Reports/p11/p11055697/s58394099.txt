                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with DOE, orthopnea, substernal CP  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of the right internal jugular approach dialysis catheter. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate
 cardiomegaly.  A small right pleural effusion is worsened compared to the
 prior study.  The lungs are well expanded with atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  Previously seen left retrocardiac opacity is improved. There is no
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Cephalization of vessels with
 increased prominence of the azygos vein indicate mild volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion, increased compared to prior, with cephalization
 of pulmonary vessels, consistent with mild volume overload.
