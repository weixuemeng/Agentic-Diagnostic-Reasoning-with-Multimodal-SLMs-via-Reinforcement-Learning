                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:59 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, after intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right lower lobe collapse has probably improved, but small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion remains.  Heart is slightly larger and coupled with
 distention of mediastinal veins and hilar contours, an indication of cardiac
 decompensation, though I do not believe edema is present.  Moderate-to-severe
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe is unchanged.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube, with the chin slightly flexed, is no more than
 14 mm above the carina.  Subsequent chest radiograph, 2:48 a.m., available at
 the time of this review showed appropriate repositioning.  No pneumothorax.
