                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:24 AM.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5
 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates below the diaphragm beyond the
 limits of the film.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There are bibasilar
 hazy and right upper heterogeneous opacities, which appear more conspicuous
 than the study 5 hours prior, consistent with worsening pulmonary edema with
 pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis or consolidation.  No pneumothorax
 appreciated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube
 terminates below the diaphragm.  
 
 2.  Worsened pulmonary edema since the study 5 hours prior with bilateral
 pleural effusions and adjacent opacities, which could represent atelectasis,
 infection, or aspiration.
