                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.  Question pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a widespread interstitial abnormality that is increased
 and suggestive of moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  There are apparently
 substantial degenerative changes of the shoulder, but not well evaluated here.
 There is similar moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 compared to the left due to an anterior eventration.  Cholecystectomy clips
 project over the right upper quadrant.  There is exaggerated kyphosis and
 similar degenerative changes at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
