                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated same day approximately 1.5 hr previously.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a patient rotated
 toward his left. Low lung volumes are seen.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 Patient is status post valvular repair. The heart is stably enlarged.
 Bilateral opacification diaphragms may reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.  Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles likely
 reflects pulmonary effusions. Unchanged since most recent study, there are
 patchy parenchymal opacities bilaterally. In a patient with known heart
 failure, this likely reflects pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bilateral opacities with small pleural effusions. In a patient with
 cardiomegaly, this is thought to reflect mild pulmonary edema. Obscuration of
 bilateral diaphragms likely reflects a component of atelectasis, though
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
