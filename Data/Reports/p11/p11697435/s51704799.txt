                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman pre op lap chole on ___  // Pre op lap chole
 on ___ Surg: ___ (lap chole)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are within normal limits.  Even allowing for the projection, the
 heart is mildly enlarged and there is mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature, particular in the upper lobes consistent with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No frank pulmonary edema seen.  No consolidation or
 pneumothorax seen.  No pleural effusion seen.  There is a relatively acute
 scoliotic curve convex the right centered at the thorax lumbar junction, there
 may be a compression deformity at this level, this is incompletely evaluated
 on this AP view only.  Degenerative changes in the left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with mild
 congestive heart failure but no frank pulmonary edema.
 2. Relatively acute scoliotic curve convex the right at the thorax lumbar
 junction, a compression fracture at this level cannot be excluded.
