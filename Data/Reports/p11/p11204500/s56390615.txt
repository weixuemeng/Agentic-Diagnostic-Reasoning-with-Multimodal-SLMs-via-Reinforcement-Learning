                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, weakness, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CTA performed ___ and PET-CT
 performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Heart size is top normal with a configuration
 suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy.  No lobar opacification is evident
 within the lungs.  However, there are faint reticular nodular opacifications
 in the left lung possibly due to underlying atypical, possibly viral
 infection.  No findings to suggest emphysema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint reticular nodular opacifications within the left lung may
 represent an atypical infection, possibly viral.  No large focal
 opacifications evident.
