                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is a focal opacity overlying
 the right lower lobe, which may be representative of a developing pneumonia in
 the proper clinical setting.  There is also a small right pleural effusion.
 Otherwise, the remainder of the lungs are clear. The heart is severely
 enlarged, slightly increased in comparison to prior studies.  The aorta
 appears large and tortuous, with calcifications, not significantly changed in
 comparison to prior study.  Diffuse osteopenia of the thoracic spine is again
 noted.  Decreased loss of height of multiple vertebral bodies as previously,
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Right lower lobe opacity with a small right pleural effusion. These
 findings are likely representative of pneumonia in the proper clinical
 setting.
 2. Severe cardiomegaly, increased in comparison to the prior study.
