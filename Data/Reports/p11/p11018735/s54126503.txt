                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, significant
 tobacco, presenting with acute on chronic shortness of breath, decreased
 breath sounds at the bases, evaluate for pulmonary edema, consolidation or
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  AP radiograph from ___.  PA and lateral radiographs
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Haziness
 at the right base most likely represents atelectasis; however, infectious
 process cannot be completely excluded.  There is prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature with upper zone redistribution, which is mostly
 unchanged from the prior exams and likely due to chronic CHF.  The heart is
 enlarged, but unchanged from the prior exam.  The aorta is tortuous with
 calcifications at the arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: Haziness at the right base most likely atelectasis; however,
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Please refer to subsequent CT
 for further details.
