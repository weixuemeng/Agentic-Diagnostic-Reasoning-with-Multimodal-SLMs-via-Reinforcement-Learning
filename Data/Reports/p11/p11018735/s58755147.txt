                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, cardiac risk factors with acute
 right-sided chest pain.  Question COPD exacerbation versus cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___. 
 CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.  Hazy opacity at the right base
 is unchanged from the prior radiographs and is most likely atelectasis.  There
 is no definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and notable for mild cardiomegaly
 and a tortuous dilated aorta.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened with
 hyperexpansion consistent with known history of COPD.  There are no acute
 fractures and wedge deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies are
 unchanged. Embolization coils in the right upper quadrant and abdominal aortic
 stent graft are noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hazy opacity at the right base is unchanged and is likely atelectasis.
 2.  Findings consistent with COPD.
