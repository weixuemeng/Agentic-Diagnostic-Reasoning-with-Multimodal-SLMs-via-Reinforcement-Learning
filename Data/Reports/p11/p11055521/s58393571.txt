  The left chest tube appears to be located anterior to the heart in within the
  chest wall and may extend beyond the left pleural lining.  The tip of the
  chest tube still projects over the right thoracic spinal border.
  
  There appears to be a new small right apical pneumothorax.  Left apex is not
  included in the image and inhibits the evaluation of the left apical
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple rib fractures s/p fall, L chest
 tube placed at OSH. Please obtain a frontal and a lateral chest xray to
 evaluate location of the L chest tube. Concern that chest tube is not actually
 positioned inside the chest (crosses midline on previous film). Lateral view
 needed to clarify location.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left chest tube is in unchanged position, crossing the midline on the
 frontal view and located  retrosternally  on the lateral view.  Epicardial
 pacer wires in dual-chamber pacemaker leads are in satisfactory position. 
 Previously seen left apical pneumothorax is not well appreciated secondary to
 exclusion from the field-of-view.  Right apical pneumothorax is small. 
 Moderate left basilar atelectasis persists.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest tube within the thorax, in the retrosternal space, crossing the
 midline, impinging on the anterior mediastinum.
