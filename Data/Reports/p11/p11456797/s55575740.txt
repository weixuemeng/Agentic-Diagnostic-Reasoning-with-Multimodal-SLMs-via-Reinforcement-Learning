                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST ___, AT 18:06 HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma from fall with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.  Please
 note the patient had an intervening chest CT dated ___, which is
 also available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  As previously noted, there is left hemithorax volume loss due to
 prior left lower lobectomy.  A consolidative and fibrotic process with
 associated fiducial markers remains in place laterally in the left upper lung
 zone.  This is stable compared to multiple prior exams.  While there is a mild
 accentuation of the interstitial markings, no focal consolidation or
 superimposed edema is noted.  Mild aortic tortuosity with calcified plaque at
 the arch is again noted.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. 
 No definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Degenerative changes are noted
 throughout the thoracic spine and in bilateral shoulders.  No displaced rib
 fractures are evident.  There are no suspicious lucent lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall stable chest x-ray examination with slight diminished
 lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There may be mild edema;
 however, no frank failure is identified.
