                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size remains
 moderately enlarged with continued aortic tortuosity and calcified
 atherosclerotic disease at the aortic arch.  Volume loss in the left lung is
 again noted secondary to prior left lower lobectomy.  Fiducial markers are
 again seen in the periphery of the left upper lobe with surrounding opacity
 compatible with prior CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment, the findings of which
 appear unchanged compared to the prior radiographic study.  Emphysematous
 changes are again noted in both lungs, with a patchy opacity seen within the
 right lung base.  This could represent an area of atelectasis though
 developing infection cannot be completely excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen, nor is there a large pleural effusion.  Pleural thickening about the
 left hemithorax is unchanged, and there is no pneumothorax.  Old left-sided
 rib fractures are present.  There is no free intraperitoneal air seen below
 the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-operative changes and post-treatment changes in the left
 hemithorax which are similar compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacity in
 the right lung base may reflect an area of developing infection or
 atelectasis.
