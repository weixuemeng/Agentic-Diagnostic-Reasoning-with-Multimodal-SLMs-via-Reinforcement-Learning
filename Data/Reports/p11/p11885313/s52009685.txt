                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post subclavian line placement and nasogastric tube
 placement, in a patient with bleeding esophagitis and possible upper GI bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, an enteric tube terminating at the GE
 junction, with the side port in the mid esophagus, and a left subclavian line
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  A right internal jugular line is no
 longer present.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There is atelectasis of the
 right middle lobe.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, is similar to
 slightly increased.  Mild pulmonary edema is improved.  There is a trace left
 pleural effusion.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube terminating at the GE junction, with the side port in the mid
 esophagus.
 2. Right middle lobe atelectasis.
 3. Trace left pleural effusion and improved edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  The enteric tube can be advanced at least 11 cm to place
 the side port within the stomach, as clinically indicated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 15:04 on ___, approximately 5
