 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:37 PM
  
  1. There is an enteric tube with distal tip projecting over the approximate
  location of the gastric body, with side-port seen approximately 5.8 cm distal
  to the GE junction.
  2. Low lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this, stable
  cardiomediastinal silhouettes.
  3. Diffuse interstitial prominence likely relates to crowding of
  bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes.
  4. Likely left greater than right bibasilar atelectasis.
  5. No pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT  // ?placement      ?placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. 
 Much low or lung volumes make it difficult to exclude mild interstitial edema
 and progressive mediastinal venous engorgement.  Heart size is normal. 
 Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.
