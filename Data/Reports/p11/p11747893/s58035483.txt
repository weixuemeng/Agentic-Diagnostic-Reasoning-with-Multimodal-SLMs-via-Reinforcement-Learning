                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT ___
 coming in with neutropenia and SOB, concern for infectious etiology  //
 evidence of PNA?     evidence of PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 14:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 10:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No focal airspace consolidation
 is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is mild crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature with slight prominence of the interstitium which is felt to most
 likely be related to lower lung volumes rather than representing an atypical
 infectious process or underlying interstitial abnormality.  Clinical
 correlation, however, is recommended.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema. 
 No pleural effusions.
