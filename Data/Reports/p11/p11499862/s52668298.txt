                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male on dialysis, treatment missed for past three weeks,
 now with weakness, shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.  There are new bibasilar opacities,
 seen both on the frontal and lateral views.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear. 
 Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles may represent small effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted over the regions of the axillae.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities potentially in part due to atelectasis;
 however, there may be a component of infection in the proper clinical setting.
