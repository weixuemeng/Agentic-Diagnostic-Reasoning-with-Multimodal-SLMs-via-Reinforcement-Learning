                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset ascites.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. 
 The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, which could
 reflect atelectasis, though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Probable small trace right pleural effusion is noted. 
 There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable small right pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes with
 probable bibasilar atelectasis.
