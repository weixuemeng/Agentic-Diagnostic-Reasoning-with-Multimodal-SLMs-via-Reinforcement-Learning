                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath.  Followup opacities in the right lower
 lobe.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lower lobe consolidation
 consistent with pneumonia is unchanged.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries are again
 noted.  Component of pulmonary edema has markedly improved.  There is no
 pneumothorax or increasing effusions.
