                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chylous effusion, status post chest tube on the left.  Continuing
 to have chest pain.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 11:43 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  As
 before, there is a pigtail catheter ending at the left lung base, not
 significantly changed.  A moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly
 changed.  Consolidation at the left lung base is similar in appearance to the
 prior radiographs from earlier today, likely compressive atelectasis, although
 infection in this region is not excluded.  Increased heterogeneous opacities
 at the right lung base are thought to be related to bronchovascular crowding
 in the setting of slightly lower lung volumes on the present study.  The heart
 size is difficult to assess but is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal
 contours are also unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No significant interval change in moderate left pleural effusion or
 consolidation at the left lung base that is thought to represent atelectasis,
 although infection in this region is not excluded.
 
 2.  No significant interval change in position of left basilar pigtail
 catheter.
