                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever, hypotension and ascites. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  A left pleural effusion is
 increased from ___. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is similar.
 Left basilar opacity is probably associated atelectais. Supervening infection
 cannot be excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, left larger than right, with left
 basilar atelectasis.  Supervening infection cannot be excluded.
