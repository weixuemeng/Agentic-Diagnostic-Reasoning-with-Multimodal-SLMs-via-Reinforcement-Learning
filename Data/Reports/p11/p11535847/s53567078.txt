                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  NASH cirrhosis and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and MR from ___.
 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size with a left ventricular configuration.  Moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted compared to the left side. 
 Patchy opacity along the posterior aspect of the right hemidiaphragm can
 probably be attributed to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded by
 this study; the opacity is new since the prior radiographs but perhaps similar
 to an interval MR allowing for differences in technique.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar opacification that could be seen with
 atelectasis associated with moderate relative elevation; although developing
 pneumonia is not completely excluded.  patchy opacification was already
 present on the prior MR study and suggestive of atelectasis.
