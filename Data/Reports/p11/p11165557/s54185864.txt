                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, recent travel to ___, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits the evaluation.  While there is no focal consolidation, there
 is a mild increase in interstitial opacity bilaterally could reflect crowding
 of bronchovasculature.  An atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded, however.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No lobar consolidation, though mild increase in interstitial
 opacity raises concern for atypical pneumonia.
