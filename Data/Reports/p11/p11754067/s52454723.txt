                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of NG tube placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which
 appears to course below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film,
 however with the sideport in the body of the stomach.  The lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated.  Streaky left basilar opacity is unchanged compared to the
 prior exam and likely secondary to atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 arch.  Lower thoracic upper lumbar vertebral hardware is unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which extends below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of view, but the sideport is in the body of the
 stomach.
