                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is extensive
 opacification of the right lower lung, mostly involving the right lower lobe,
 which is largely consolidated perhaps with a right middle lobe component of
 opacification.  The left lung remains clear.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive opacification in the right lower lung most consistent
 with pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended within eight weeks in
 order to show resolution.
