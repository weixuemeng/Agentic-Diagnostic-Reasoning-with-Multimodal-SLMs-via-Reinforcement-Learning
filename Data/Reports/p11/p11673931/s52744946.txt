                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea  // eval for edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Small the moderate bilateral effusions, larger on
 the right are again noted.  There is more dense opacity in the retrocardiac
 region.  Mild pulmonary edema may be slightly worse compared to prior.  Median
 sternotomy wires and cardiomegaly are unchanged.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.
 Superimposed retrocardiac opacity is noted, potentially in part due to
 atelectasis although infection at either base would be difficult to exclude. 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
