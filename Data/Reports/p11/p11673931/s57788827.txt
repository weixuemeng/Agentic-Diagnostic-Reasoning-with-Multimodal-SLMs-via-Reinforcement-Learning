                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  CAD s/p CABG and MVR on ___, sCHF (EF ___%) who presented
 ___ with N/V/headache/dizziness, found to be in shock. Suspected septic
 initially, s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy with concern for possible
 gallbladder source and also concern due to left saphenous vein also with
 superficial infection. ICU course complicated by PEA arrest x10 min on ___
 without clear precipitant. Patient extubated and stable in MICU and called out
 to the floor on ___ now with hypotension  // concern HCAP, fluid status
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with apparent prosthetic valve.  A left
 IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora, slightly more pronounced than on
 the prior film.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left
 lower Lat left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior
 film.  As before, the possibility of a left-sided effusion cannot be excluded.
 On the right, there is opacity at the right lung base, suggestive of a right
 pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, also overall
 similar to the prior film.
 
 A pigtail catheter overlies the right mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Vascular plethora with interstitial and probable early alveolar edema,
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.
 2. Cardiomegaly with right and question left pleural effusion and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study.
 3. No pneumothorax detected.
