                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, intubated, IABP.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 ET tube and NG tube are unchanged.  The intra-aortic balloon pump lies
 approximately 4.4 mm below the inferior edge of the aortic knob, appearing
 slightly higher on today's exam.  Again seen is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter
 with tip over distal pulmonary artery.  
 
 As before, there is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with
 obscuration of left hemidiaphragm and a small left effusion, which appears
 slightly worse compared to one day earlier. There is upper zone redistribution
 and mild vascular blurring, consistent with mild fluid overload.  Minimal
 patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle again noted and could
 represent a small amount of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Slight interval worsening of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 and small left effusion.
 3.  Mild vascular plethora.  Question mild CHF.
