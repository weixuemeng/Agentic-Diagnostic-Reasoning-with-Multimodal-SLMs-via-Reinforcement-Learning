                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute heart failure, respiratory failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 7 ___ a.m., the ET tube, NG tube, and Swan-Ganz
 catheter are grossly unchanged.  The NG tube extends beyond the inferior
 border of the film.  An aortic balloon pump is present.  It may lie slightly
 lower than on the earlier film, currently approximately 17 mm below the
 inferior edge of the aortic knob.  As before, the Swan-Ganz catheter tip
 overlies the distal portion of the right pulmonary artery.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is patchy opacity in left
 upper zone, which appears more pronounced than on the earlier film.  Some of
 this may relate to structures overlying the patient, but it raises the
 question of an early area of infiltrate  or aspiration or early changes
 related to fluid overload.  No gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Aortic balloon pump now lies slightly lower than on yesterday's film.  
 2.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip remains relatively distal -- clinical correlation
 requested regarding possible retraction.
 3.  New patchy opacity left upper zone, ?  early infiltrate or aspiration
 early changes related to fluid overload.  Clinical correlation and attention
 to this area on followup films is requested.
 4.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, somewhat more pronounced on
 this study.
