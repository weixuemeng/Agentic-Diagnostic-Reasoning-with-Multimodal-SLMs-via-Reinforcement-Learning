                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain x 2 days.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: An abnormality on the right involves elevation of the lung base,
 best seen on the lateral view, as well as a opacity evident on the frontal
 view of unclear etiology. The left lung appears clear.  There is no pulmonary
 edema and the hilar contours are normal. The cardiac size is normal.  The
 aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: Elevation of the right lung base and associated opacity noted on
 the frontal view. Shallow oblique views may be helpful in discerning if there
 is any focal process which could contribute to the patient's chest pain.
