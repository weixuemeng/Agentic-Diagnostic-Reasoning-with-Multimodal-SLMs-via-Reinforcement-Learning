                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post right mastectomy and right axillary node dissection
 with multiple clips seen projecting over the axilla.  The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the thoracic aorta are noted. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is continued prominence of the
 pulmonary vascular markings with some upper zone vascular redistribution
 suggestive of chronic mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear scarring is
 noted within the right lower lobe. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings with upper zone re-
 distribution, suggestive of chronic mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
