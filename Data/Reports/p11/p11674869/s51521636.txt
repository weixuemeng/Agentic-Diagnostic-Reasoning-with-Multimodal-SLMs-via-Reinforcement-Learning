                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest, four views.
 
 INDICATION:  Feeding tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 3 chest radiographs centered above the diaphragm and one centered below the
 diaphragm show successive repositioning of an nasogastric feeding tube with
 the wire stylet in place from the upper midline, in the esophagus or right
 main bronchus, to the upper stomach, and finally to the lower stomach close to
 the pylorus.
 
 Lungs are low in volume but clear.  Heart size is normal.  Widening of the
 upper mediastinum could be due to vascular engorgement, fat deposition or even
 adenopathy.  Conventional radiographs are recommended when feasible.  No
 pleural abnormality.
