                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with confusion.  // compare to prior ?pna     
 compare to prior ?pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 The prominence of the superior mediastinum is no longer seen.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits and there is no appreciable vascular
 congestion.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen.
 Although there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia, this would be
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
