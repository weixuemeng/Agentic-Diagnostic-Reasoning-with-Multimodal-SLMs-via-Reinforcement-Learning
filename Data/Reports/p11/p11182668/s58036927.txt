 COMPARISON:  ___ CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the confluence of the

 demonstrated, as noted on the prior CT.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable with calcification of the aortic arch again noted. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  Previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules in the right upper
 lobe on CT are not clearly seen on the current exam due to their small size. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
