                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are clear.  A tiny radiodensity
 projecting over the underside of the right posterior tenth rib does not have
 definite correlate on lateral view and could potentially represent a small
 calcified granuloma.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Tiny radiodensity projecting over the right posterior tenth rib could
 represent a small calcified granuloma.
