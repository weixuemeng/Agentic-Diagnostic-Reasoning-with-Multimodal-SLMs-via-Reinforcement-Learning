                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic cancer and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to CT torso from ___.  Most recent
 prior chest radiograph was performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities, multiple, consistent with the
 patient's known metastatic disease; difficult to accurately compare to prior
 given differences in modality to the prior CT, however, overall, nodular
 opacaities appear to have increased in size, and possibly number, worrisome
 for worsening metastatic disease.  No definite new focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Osseous metastatic disease better
 assessed on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive pulmonary metastases worrisome for progression since the prior CT
 from ___, given differences in modality.
