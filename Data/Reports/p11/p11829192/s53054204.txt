                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post endobronchial biopsies.  Study
 requested for evaluation of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple diffuse rounded opacities, many of which were previously
 identified on chest CT from ___, are present and are consistent
 with known metastatic pulmonary nodules.  Some nodules identified on prior
 chest CT examination are difficult to appreciate on today's film. Overall,
 size of the right perihilar and upper lobe lesions are not essentially
 changed.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. A right Port-A-Cath
 catheter terminates in the low SVC.  There is no definite pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Multiple diffuse rounded opacities consistent with known pulmonary
 metastasis. No definite pneumothorax.
