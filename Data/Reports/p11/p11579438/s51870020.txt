                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval progression of previously visualized
 retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm and may be
 suggestive of pneumonia in this region.  Furthermore, there is now a new
 opacity silhouetting the right heart border suggestive of right middle lobe
 pneumonia.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  While evaluation
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due to silhouetting by
 opacities, the visualized cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 There is a new right middle lobe opacity suggestive of middle lobe pneumonia.
 Furthermore, there has been progression of the previously visualized
 retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm and is
 suggestive of left lower lobe pneumonia.  
 
 In the proper clinical setting, the combination of these findings may be
 representative of multifocal pneumonia.
