                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 clearing of the opacification at the right base medially.  Mild retrocardiac
 opacification consistent with atelectasis and effusion persists.
 
 There is a vague suggestion of some asymmetry in opacification in the upper
 zone, more prominent on the right.  This could represent a developing focus of
 consolidation and should be carefully checked on subsequent radiographs.
