                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Small linear
 opacities in the left lower lung are likely due to atelectasis; otherwise,
 there is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
