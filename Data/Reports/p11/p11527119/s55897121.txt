                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with progressive shortness of breath and
 dry hacking cough.  Patient is status post kidney transplant
 (immunosuppressed) for ___ years.  Aortic valve replacement last year and his
 previous CHF resolved as of recent visits.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy as before.  Again
 identified are the tiny metallic circular structures in the aortic valve area
 indicative of Medtronics valve prosthesis placement.  Position is unchanged. 
 Heart size and configuration has not undergone any significant interval
 change.  As before, a few mitral ring calcifications are identified
 demonstrating also a mild enlargement of the left ventricular contour
 posteriorly.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated but no
 local contour abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  There exist bilateral peripheral pleural scar formations with mild
 blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses probably representing
 post-operative changes.  No evidence of any new acute parenchymal infiltrate
 and no evidence of increasing CHF.  The apical area is clear on the frontal
 view excluding the possibility of any pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No radiographic evidence of increasing
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates during the last five-month
 examination interval.
