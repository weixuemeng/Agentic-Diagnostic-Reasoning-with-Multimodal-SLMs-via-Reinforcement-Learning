                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post assault with possible loss of
 consciousness and left posterior rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Chest, PA and lateral.  The lungs are clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. No displaced rib fractures seen.  However, the chest radiograph is an
 insensitive test for subtle rib fractures.  If there is continued clinical
 concern, dedicated rib radiographs with a radiologic marker at the site of
 patient's pain could be obtained.
