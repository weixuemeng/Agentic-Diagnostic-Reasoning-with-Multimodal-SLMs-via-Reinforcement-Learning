                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with crackles, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Substantial scoliosis convex to the right is again seen.  Enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles persists.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the
 bases, though no definite acute pneumonia.
 
 Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is again seen on the right.
