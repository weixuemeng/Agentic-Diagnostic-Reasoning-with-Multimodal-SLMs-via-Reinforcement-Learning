                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with orthopnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  The aorta is
 tortuous, following the contours of a marked thoracic dextroscoliosis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is mild atelectasis at the
 right lung base but no consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Degenerative change
 of the bilateral humeral heads is seen with loss of joint space and
 subchondral cysts.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with significant thoracic dextroscoliosis.
 No evidence for congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
