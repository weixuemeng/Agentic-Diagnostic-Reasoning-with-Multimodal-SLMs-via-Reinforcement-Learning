                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of VP shunt, confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Allowing for differences in patient positioning, there is redemonstration of a
 right-sided pleural effusion with fluid tracking into the minor fissure. There
 is severe dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine, limiting evaluation of the
 left effusion.  Upper lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.    A right-sided catheter likely reflects a ventricular peritoneal
 shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Redemonstration of moderate-sized right pleural effusion.  No definite
 additional change is seen.
