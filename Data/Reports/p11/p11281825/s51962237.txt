 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation. This is particularly notable at the
 lung bases. A small to moderate right pleural effusion persists.  Severe
 scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the ribcage and mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette but currently no overt pulmonary edema. Minimal atelectasis
 at both lung bases, no pneumonia.
