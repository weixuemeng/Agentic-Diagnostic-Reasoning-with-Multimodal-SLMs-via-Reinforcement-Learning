                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with fluid
 tracking within the fissure.  Evaluation for left effusion is limited
 secondary to severe scoliosis.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Severe dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracic spine is again noted.  Catheter projects over the right chest, likely
 a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  No definite other change
 since prior noting limitation due to the patient's scoliosis.
