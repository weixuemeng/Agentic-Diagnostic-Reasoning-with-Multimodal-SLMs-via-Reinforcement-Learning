                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ili  fever  // ili  fever
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a new
 parenchymal opacity in the lateral aspects of the right lower lobe.  The
 opacities ill-defined and shows several air bronchograms.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, the changes are highly suggestive of pneumonia. Because of
 the rather rounded appearance of the opacity on the lateral radiograph,
 complete resolution must be documented radiographically. No pleural effusions
 or other complications.  Normal size of the heart.
