                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for varicella pneumonia in a pregnant patient with
 chickenpox and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a subtle linear opacity in the
 left lower lung field, without a correlate on the lateral view.  This most
 likely represents atelectasis rather than a focal consolidation.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There are no findings to suggest varicella pneumonia. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No findings typical of varicella pneumonia.
 2.  Subtle left lower lung field opacity, seen only on the PA view, which most
 likely represents atelectasis rather than a focal consolidation.
