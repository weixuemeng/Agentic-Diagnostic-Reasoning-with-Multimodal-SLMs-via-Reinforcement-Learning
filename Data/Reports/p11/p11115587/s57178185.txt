                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD, COPD, s/p C3-C6 Lami and Occiput-C7
 Fusion, Intubated, for evaluation of ETT, OGT, and Lungs  // Eval placement of
 ETT, OGT, Lungs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated,
 with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 8.3 cm above the carina, with
 notification detailed on the wet reading.  Orogastric tube has been placed,
 with tip terminating in the stomach beyond the field of view.  Diffuse veil
 like opacity in the left hemi thorax may reflect layering pleural effusion. 
 Known left hilar mass has been more fully evaluated by a recent CT, and note
 is made of worsening left retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation.  Multiple
 lytic bone lesions have also been more fully evaluated by a recent CT scan.
