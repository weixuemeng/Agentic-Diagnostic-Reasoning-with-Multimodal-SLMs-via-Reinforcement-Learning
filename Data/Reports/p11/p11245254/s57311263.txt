                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal but stable compared
 to prior exam.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable.  The
 lung volumes are slightly low, accentuating equivocal opacity in the
 retrocardiac space; this may reflect crowding of normal structures vs.
 atelectasis, and a superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded,
 although felt unlikely.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
