                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, status post right internal jugular line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:45 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular
 catheter.  The tip cannot be visualized due to pacemaker leads, but it at
 least reaches the upper SVC.  The endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube follows the expected course ending below the
 diaphragm, although the tip is not visualized.  There is gaseous distention of
 the stomach.  Left upper lobe and possibly right lung pneumonia is unchanged.
 There is diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular catheter is not seen below the level of
 the upper SVC due to overlying cardiac pacemaker leads.  An oblique or lateral
 view could be performed for further confirmation of placement, if needed.
