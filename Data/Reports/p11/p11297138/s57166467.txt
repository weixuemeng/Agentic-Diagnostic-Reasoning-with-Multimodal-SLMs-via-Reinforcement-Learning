                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Massive PE, now atrial flutter, increasing dyspnea.  Increasing
 hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 similar.  Prominent right hilum is again seen.  Pulmonary vascular markings
 are more balanced, though peripheral vessels may be attenuated on both sides. 
 There is no evidence of CHF.  Aside from some bibasilar atelectasis, no focal
 infiltrate or gross effusion is identified.  Small effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No CHF, frank consolidation, or gross
 effusion.
