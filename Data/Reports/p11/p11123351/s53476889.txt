                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of leukocytosis,
 concern for delirium.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Projecting
 over the right upper lobe is a 0.5 cm calcified nodule, likely a granuloma. 
 There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  At the lateral left lung base,
 there is a 4-5 mm rounded opacity which could represent a vessel on end,
 however underlying pulmonary nodule cannot be entirely excluded and can be
 further evaluated on an outpatient chest CT.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  4-mm rounded nodular density at the
 lateral left lung base may relate to a vessel on end, although an underlying
 pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Recommend non-urgent chest CT for
 further evaluation.
