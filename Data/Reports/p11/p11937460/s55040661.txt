                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p valvuloplasty, now extubated, concern for
 aspiration PNA, patient also now with missing tooth evaluate for Interval
 change in L sided consolidation? presence of tooth in lung?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and PET
 scan dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior radiograph, the left lung base opacity is
 improved.  A layering right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is
 new.  A moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is largely obscured
 by effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.  Radiopacity projecting at the
 level of the right hilar structures may represent the aspirated tooth within
 the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in left lung base consolidation.
 2. Moderate left layering pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
 3. Radiopacity projecting at the level of the right hilum may represent the
 aspirated tooth.
