                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 1:36 P.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bradycardia and syncope, here to evaluate
 for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact wires. 
 Multiple mediastinal clips are compatible with prior CABG.  Mild enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The descending thoracic aorta is moderately tortuous in
 its course.  Eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  The lungs
 are symmetrically well aerated.  Mild atelectasis is noted in the left lung
 base.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears chronic, likely related
 to pleural thickening. No significant pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Mild
 increased interstitial opacities at the lung bases appear to be chronic. The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
