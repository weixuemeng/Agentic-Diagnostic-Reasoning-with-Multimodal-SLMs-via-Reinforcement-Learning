 HISTORY:  Syncope, shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ most

 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker device is again noted with the single pacemaker lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 with multiple mediastinal surgical clips, compatible with prior CABG.  The
 lungs again demonstrated prominent interstitial markings, not significantly
 changed compared to prior study.  No focal opacity is identified.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 
 2. Stable prominent interstitial markings, possibly due to chronic intersitial
 lung disease.
