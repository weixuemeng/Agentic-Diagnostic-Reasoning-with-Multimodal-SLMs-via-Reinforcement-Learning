 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, now with cough, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia or evidence of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.  CT
 T-spine of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacer device is unchanged in position with a single
 lead terminating in the right ventricle as before.  The patient is status post
