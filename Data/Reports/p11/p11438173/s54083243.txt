                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with tachypnea and
 hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternal wires,
 mediastinal clips, and a left chest wall pacer device with the lead overlying
 the right ventricle.  Heart size is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  There is
 obscuration  of the left heart border consistent with a lingular
 consolidation.  Additional patchy opacities are noted in the right lower and
 upper lung. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal patchy opacities, most prominent in the lingula.  This may reflect
 pneumonia versus sequela of aspiration.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
