                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vasovagal syncope, elevated white count, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with multiple mediastinal clips.  There
 is mild cardiomegaly, with a tortuous aorta.  There is hyperinflation, with
 flattened diaphragms, suggesting COPD.  The left hemidiaphragm is also
 eventrated.  There is some increase in interstitial markings, ?related to
 scarring.  I doubt CHF.  There is atelectasis at the left lung base.  There is
 a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening in the left costophrenic
 angle and along the left chest wall, unchanged compared with ___.  No
 focal infiltrate or consolidation is identified.
 
 Incidental note is made of an anterior wedge compression fracture of the T12
 versus L1 vertebral body.  This appears to have been described on a spine MRI
 dated ___.  Those films are currently offline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 COPD and cardiomegaly.  Atelectasis and minimal pleural fluid and/or
 thickening at left base.  No focal opacity to suggest acute pneumonic
 infiltrate.
