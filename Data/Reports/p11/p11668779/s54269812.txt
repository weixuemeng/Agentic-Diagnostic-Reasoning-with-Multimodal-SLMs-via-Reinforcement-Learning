                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Flank pain and dysuria.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle nodular increased interstitial markings bilaterally which could be due
 to an atypical infection.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacities, right more so than left lung, could be
 due to atypical infection.  Suggest comparison with any prior studies,
 follow-up chest radiograph when acute symptoms subside.
