                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and shortness  // pneumonia/COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Diffuse interstitial
 reticular nodular opacities are present, similar to previous examination with
 slight lower lobe and mid lung predominance.  In addition there is
 questionable new nodule in the right mid lung.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No definitive evidence of lymphadenopathy is present. 
 Overall the findings are concerning for stable but extensive reticulonodular
 disease with potentially new nodule and does father assessment with chest CT
 would be justified .
