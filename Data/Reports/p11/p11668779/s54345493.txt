                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath  // shortness of
 breath and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal with and without change. Small calcified
 right upper lobe nodules appear unchanged. A diffuse, subtle micronodular
 pattern also appears unchanged but is not fully characterized radiologically. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle micronodular pattern, which is not fully characterized by conventional
 chest radiographs.  Dedicated chest CT may be helpful to better characterize
 these findings, and to help differentiate granulomatous processes
 (sarcoidosis, prior granulomatous exposure) from indolent infection as well as
 the unlikely possibility of slowly growing miliary metastases.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
