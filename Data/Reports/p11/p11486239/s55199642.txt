                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:54 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a right pleural effusion and pneumothorax,
 chest tube in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right upper pleural tube unchanged in position.  Small right pneumothorax is
 predominantly lateral and inferior.  Tube function should be evaluated to see
 if it is fissural.  Consolidation in the right lower lung has been stable
 since thoracentesis.  Whether this is re-expansion edema, residual
 atelectasis, or primary pulmonary pathology is radiographically indeterminate
 at this stage.  Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.  No pulmonary edema.
