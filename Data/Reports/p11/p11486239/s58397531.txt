 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. There is
 suggestion of increased opacification in the bilateral lung bases, which
 appears interstitial. This could simply be a manifestation of chronic
 pulmonary disease or elevated pulmonary venous pressure. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia is considered.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
