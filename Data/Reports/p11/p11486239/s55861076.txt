                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS with new OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of
 a nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body or proximal antrum of the
 stomach.  The chest is not optimally evaluated on this study.  There are now
 two chest tubes in place, though the apices are not seen so that the
 pneumothorax cannot be evaluated.  Routine chest radiograph would be necessary
 for this purpose.
