                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and recent pulmonary emboli.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the subcutaneous gas along the
 right lateral chest wall and extending into the neck has substantially
 decreased.  Post-operative changes are again seen at the right base with
 blunting of the costophrenic angle consistent with pleural fluid and some
 atelectatic change.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 There is again prominence of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
