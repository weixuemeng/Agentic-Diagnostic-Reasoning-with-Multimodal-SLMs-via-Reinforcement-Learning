                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  AFib with RVR, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Additional patchy
 bilateral lower lobe opacities, particularly on the right may be due to
 underlying consolidation, which may be due to infection and/or consolidation. 
 Accurate assessment of the cardiac silhouette is suboptimal due to the
 bibasilar opacities.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  The patient is rotated to
 the left.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Additional bibasilar opacities, particularly at the right mid-to-lower lung
 may be due to infection and/or aspiration.
