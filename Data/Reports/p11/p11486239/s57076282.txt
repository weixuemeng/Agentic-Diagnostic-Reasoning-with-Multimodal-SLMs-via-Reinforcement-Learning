 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AFib, on amiodarone, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lungs are substantially
 better inflated.  There is no evidence for a basal fibrosis or other fibrotic
 changes.  Relatively dense area at the right lung bases is not seen on the
 lateral radiograph and likely corresponds to the crossing of two ribs.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.  Mild overinflation.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
