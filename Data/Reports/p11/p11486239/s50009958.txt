 reaccumulation of fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two right-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position, one oriented

 is unchanged, consistent with prior surgery and a small amount of residual
 pleural fluid.  Stable subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right upper
 abdominal wall.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  A small left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no new consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  A right PICC
 terminates in the mid SVC and is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of two right-sided chest tubes and mild
 opacification at the right base.  No evidence of reaccumulation.
