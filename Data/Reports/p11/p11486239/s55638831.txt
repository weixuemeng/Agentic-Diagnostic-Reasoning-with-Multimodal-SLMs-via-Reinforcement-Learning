                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:20 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tube in place.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 7:54.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 8:20 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Right chest tube remains in place.  A loculated hyperlucency is seen in the
 right lateral lower thorax which could reflect a loculated pneumothorax. 
 There is improving aeration at the right base with residual patchy opacity
 which likely reflects resolving atelectasis or edema related to re-expansion. 
 There is a residual small right effusion.  Left lung is grossly clear.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable
 given differences in patient positioning.
