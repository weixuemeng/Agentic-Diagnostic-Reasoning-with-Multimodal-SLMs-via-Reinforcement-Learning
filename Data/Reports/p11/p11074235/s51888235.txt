                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with reported history of pneumonia presenting with
 fever, afib  with rapid ventricular rate// please eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is new compared to the previous
 exam.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis,
 but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes are noted involving
 the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, new from the prior chest
 radiograph which may reflect cardiomyopathy, though a component of a
 pericardial effusion is not excluded.  Echocardiogram is suggested for further
 assessment.
 2. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
