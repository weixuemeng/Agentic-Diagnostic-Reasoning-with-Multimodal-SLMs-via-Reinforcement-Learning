                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic malignant  peripheral nerve sheath
 sarcoma, currently with fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are unchanged.  Right lower lung opacity appears to be
 slightly prominent than on the prior study, potentially representing worsening
 infection.  Pulmonary nodules in the right upper and lower lobes can be seen
 as well as left para-aortic mass.
