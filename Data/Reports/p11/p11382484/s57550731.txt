                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic sarcoma and lung cancer, pain, question new infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes. Again seen is the right-sided
 indwelling catheter and sutures in the right mid-lung.Patchy bibasilar
 opacities, slightly more pronounced than on ___, on both sides.   The left
 base opacity is definitively new compared with ___.   The differential
 diagnosis includes atelectasis and early pneumonic infiltrate.  Right mid lung
 opacity associated with surgical sutures is similar, allowing for differences
 in technique.
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. No CHF or gross effusion is identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening patchy opacity left base could reflect an early
 pneumonic infiltrate.  Right cardiophrenic opacity also slightly worse.
