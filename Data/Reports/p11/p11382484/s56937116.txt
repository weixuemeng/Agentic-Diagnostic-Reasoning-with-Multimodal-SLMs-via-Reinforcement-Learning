                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic sarcoma, lung carcinoma, is admitted for control of
 Port-A-Cath position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lungs show improved
 ventilation on today's examination.  However, areas of scarring and
 atelectasis are still seen at the right lung basis.
 
 The patient has received a right Port-A-Cath.  The vascular part of the port
 is in correct position.  The course of the line is unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
