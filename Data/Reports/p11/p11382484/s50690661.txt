                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  VATS wedge resection for lung nodules.  Chest tube removed. 
 Question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right pleural tube has been removed.  Small right pleural effusion persists
 but there is no pneumothorax.  Atelectasis at the lung bases, particularly the
 right, has worsened.  Multiple lung nodules are noted.  Mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes.
