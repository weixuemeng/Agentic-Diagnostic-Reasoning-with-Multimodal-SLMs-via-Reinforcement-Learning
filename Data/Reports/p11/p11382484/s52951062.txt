                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the SVC, unchanged.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mass adjacent to the aortic arch as well as bilateral pulmonary
 nodules are again demonstrated, and relatively unchanged, better assessed on
 the prior CT.  Small left pleural effusion persists.  Streaky opacity in the
 left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  Chain sutures are noted within
 the right lower lobe.  Patchy opacity within the right lung base also appears
 relatively unchanged compared to the prior studies.  No pneumothorax or
 right-sided pleural effusion is identified.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.  No free air is
 seen under the diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively similar appearance of the chest compared to the prior study with
 continued bibasilar patchy airspace opacities and small left pleural effusion.
 Multiple pulmonary nodules and mass adjacent to the aortic arch are unchanged.
 No free air is identified under the diaphragms.
