 INDICATION:  ___M with delirium  // Evidence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Gas-filled loops of bowel noted
 below both right and left hemidiaphragm which limits evaluation for
 pneumoperitoneum.  The lungs appear relatively clear though lucent appearing
 which may reflect emphysema.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged with unfolded thoracic aorta. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.  No signs of pneumonia.
