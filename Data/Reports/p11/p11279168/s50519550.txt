                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing confusion  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, on ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again
 noted is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  In the right infrahilar region,
 there is a opacity which was not definitively seen on prior examination though
 this may be related to technique and poor inspiration.  Opacity is also seen
 in the posterior portion of the chest on the lateral view.  In the appropriate
 clinical context, this may represent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe/left lower lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 context.
