                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, with a missing tooth.  Evaluate for traumatic
 injury or foreign body.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There is no consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Again, there are extensive
 calcifications of the costochondral junctions.  There is mild loss of height
 in several of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies, which is likely chronic. 
 Comparison is difficult, as there is no lateral view in the prior exam.  No
 acute fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Mild loss of height in multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies is likely
 chronic.  Recommend clinical correlation with symptoms.
