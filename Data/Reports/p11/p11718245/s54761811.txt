                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known ulcers, sudden onset abdominal pain radiating to the
 chest, question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is no free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Contrast is noted in the upper abdominal
 large bowel loops.  A subtle nodular density is new at the left lung base seen
 only on the frontal projection may represent a nipple shadow or possibly early
 focus of pneumonia.  Please note this nodular focus was not seen on the CT of
 the lung bases from earlier today.  Aside from this, no abnormalities are seen
 within the chest.  Heart and mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Subtle nodular
 opacity at the left lung base, new from prior CT from earlier today, question
 nipple shadow or early focus of pneumonia.  Consider repeat with optimized
 inspiration and nipple markers.
