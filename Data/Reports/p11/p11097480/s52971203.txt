  Low lung volumes contribute to focal atelectasis in the right middle and lower
  lobe.  The right lower lobe atelectasis on the frontal view has a somewhat
  nodular appearance.  Given this, a short term interval follow up PA and
  lateral views of the chest are recommended in to assure that no more worrisome
  underlying lesion is present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  Lung volumes
 are low causing areas of focal atelectasis such as of the right middle and
 lower lobe.  The right lower lobe atelectasis on the frontal radiograph
 appears slightly nodular.  There is no evidence of pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal sillouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes contribute to focal atelectasis in the right middle and lower
 lobe.  The right lower lobe atelectasis on the frontal view has a somewhat
 nodular appearance.  Given this, a short term interval follow up PA and
 lateral views of the chest are recommended in to assure that no more worrisome
 underlying lesion/mass is present.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with  ___ at 12:15 pm
