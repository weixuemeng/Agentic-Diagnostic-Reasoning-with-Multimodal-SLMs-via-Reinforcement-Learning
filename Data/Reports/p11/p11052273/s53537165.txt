                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to
 the prior study.  Aortic knob calcifications are again noted.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable.  Previously noted pattern of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion has essentially resolved.  Streaky opacity in the right
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for congestive heart failure.  Patchy
 streaky opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis though
 infection is difficult to exclude.
