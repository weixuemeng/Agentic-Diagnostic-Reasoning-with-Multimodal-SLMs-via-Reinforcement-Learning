                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hematemesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 probably unremarkable.  Mild interstitial prominence suggests some degree of
 mild fluid overload but no focal opacification is appreciated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perhaps slight fluid overload but no focal opacification or free air seen.
