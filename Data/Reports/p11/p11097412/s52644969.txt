                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right middle cerebral artery
 infarct, now intubated and ventilated.  Evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 obtained one and a half hours earlier during the same day.  During the
 interval, an NG tube has been placed but is seen to reach well below the
 diaphragm, pointing in the stomach in the direction towards the pylorus.  No
 interval changes are seen on the portable chest examination in comparison with
 the preceding study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate position of NG tube.
