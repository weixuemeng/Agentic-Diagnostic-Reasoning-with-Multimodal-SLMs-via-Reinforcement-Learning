                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with decreased breath sounds in the upper right
 lung.  Patient with progressive nausea and history of VATS on the left.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 stable.  There is evidence of loss of volume in the left upper lobe. 
 Irregular faint opacity in the left upper lobe could be postoperative changes.
 Ill-defined opacities in the right upper lobe and larger in the right lower
 lobe are new.  If the patient has symptoms of infection, this would correspond
 to pneumonia.  The left hilum is shifted towards the apex, unchanged from
 prior.  There is no pneumothorax or pleura effusion.
