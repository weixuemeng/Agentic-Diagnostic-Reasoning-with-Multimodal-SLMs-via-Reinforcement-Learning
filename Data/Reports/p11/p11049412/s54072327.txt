                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old s/p liver transplant. s/p revision today, was on RA
 now requiring 3 L otherwise asymptomatic  // r/o acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable, and pulmonary edema has
 nearly resolved in the interval with minimal residual interstitial edema
 remaining.  Pleural effusions have nearly resolved.  Bibasilar opacities are
 improved on the left and slightly worse on the right.  Findings are likely due
 to atelectasis, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration and infectious
 pneumonia.
