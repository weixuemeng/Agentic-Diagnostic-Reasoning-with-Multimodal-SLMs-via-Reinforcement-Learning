                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic RCC, now with productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Diffuse, rounded, multifocal opacities are seen, likely reflecting the
 patient's known metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  There is no larger opacities
 with air bronchograms suggest a lobar pneumonia.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is identified.  Significant bilateral hilar
 lymphadenopathy is noted.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No definitive radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
 
 2. Diffuse, multifocal rounded opacities are consistent with the patient's
 known metastatic disease.
