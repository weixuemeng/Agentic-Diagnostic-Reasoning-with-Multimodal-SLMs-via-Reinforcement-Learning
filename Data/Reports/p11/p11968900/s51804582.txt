                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with known pneumothorax with hypoxia on NRB  // eval
 for pneumonia/pneumothorax expansion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___.  Outside hospital
 radiograph from ___ P
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse widespread pulmonary airspace opacities more confluent in
 the right middle lobe and lingula compared to the CT from ___. A
 small to moderate left pneumothorax is similar to the outside hospital
 radiograph from earlier today. Mild septal thickening may be due to pulmonary
 edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal in size however largely obscured by airspace opacities. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small to moderate left pneumothorax, unchanged from the radiograph obtained
 earlier today.
 2. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with more confluent opacities in the
 right middle lobe and lingula which may represent rapid worsening of
 metastases or coexisting multifocal pneumonia.
 3. Septal thickening likely due to mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were reported to Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ ___ telephone at 12:30 on ___ immediately after
 discovery.
