                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Bulging of the right mediastinal contour
 in the region of the ascending aorta could be due to aneurysm or mass. Hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. No pneumonia.
 2. Right mediastinal contour abnormality. If there is no prior imaging already
 explaining this, recommend further evaluation with chest CT.
