                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement, respiratory failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.9 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter tip terminates in the SVC.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Bilateral perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Bilateral hilar
 enlargement is also noted which could reflect underlying lymphadenopathy or
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Additionally, ill-defined nodular opacities
 are noted throughout both lungs, with some appearing cavitary, such as a 12 mm
 lesion within the left lung base.  Bandlike opacities within both lung bases
 may reflect focal atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely
 reflects a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Support lines and tubes are in standard positions.
 
 2. Ill-defined nodular opacities scattered in both lungs, some of which appear
 cavitary.  These findings are concerning for a diffuse infectious process,
 with septic emboli or fungal organisms in the differential, or possibly
 metastases.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 4. Enlargement of the hila bilaterally could reflect underlying
 lymphadenopathy or pulmonary arterial hypertension.
