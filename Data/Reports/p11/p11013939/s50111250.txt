  There has been rapid worsening of diffuse alveolar pulmonary edema in the 3
  hour interval since the prior chest radiograph.  The heart size is unchanged
  raising concern for non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema.  If other
  clinical data support ARDS, this is a possibility.  Multiple nodular opacities
  are again seen, not markedly changed from the prior study.  ETT and support
  lines unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  --___ were communicated to Dr. ___

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:08 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a rapid worsening
 of the bilateral parenchymal opacities.  Mainly suggesting centralized
 pulmonary edema.  At the current time point, there are no major pleural
 effusions.  The multiple bilateral lung nodules, likely metastatic in origin,
 are unchanged.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 monitoring and support devices.
