                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph at 09:55.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina and could be pulled back
 1-2 cm. A vascular stent overlying the subclavian vessels has stable position.
 NG tube terminates below the diaphragm beyond the limits of the image. Heart
 size is normal. The vascular pedicle is widened, similar to prior. Diffuse
 airspace opacities widely involving both lungs is consistent with pulmonary
 edema though superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina and could be pulled
 back 1-2 cm.
 
 2. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
