 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with feeding tube in place, check to see if
 the Dobbhoff tube is post-pyloric.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11:18, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The Dobbhoff feeding tube has its tip within the stomach and is not in a
 post-pyloric position.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant,
 consistent with cholecystectomy.  The visualized lungs appear grossly clear. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given
 differences in positioning between studies.
