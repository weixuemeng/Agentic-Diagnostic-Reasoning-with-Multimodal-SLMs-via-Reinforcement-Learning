                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of Crohn,
 immunosuppressed with history of atypical mycobacterial infection and sputum,
 currently with weight loss and diarrhea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are well inflated and
 essentially clear except for focal linear opacities that might potentially
 represent minimal bronchiectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Overall slight progression of the atypical mycobacterial infection in
 particular in the left lower lung cannot be excluded and correlation with
 chest CT for precise assessment of this area is recommended.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
