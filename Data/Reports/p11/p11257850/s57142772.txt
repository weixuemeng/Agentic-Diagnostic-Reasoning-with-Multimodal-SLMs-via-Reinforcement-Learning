                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right IJ placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Right IJ line is
 identified with tip in the proximal right atrium.  There is no visualized
 right apical pneumothorax.  No definite left pneumothorax.  There is, however,
 horizontal line at the left lung base suggesting air-fluid level, raising
 possibility of hydropneumothorax.  Alternatively, this could be due to
 relatively flat diaphragm and effusion.  Mild blunting seen at the right
 cardiophrenic angle as well.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Mitral
 annular calcification is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right IJ central line in the proximal right atrium.  Possible air
 fluid level at the left lung base, raising possibility of hydropneumothorax
 versus pleural effusion and flattened hemidiaphragm.  Two-view chest x-ray
 suggested to further characterize.
