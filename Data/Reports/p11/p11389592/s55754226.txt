                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Hyperinflation suggests air trapping due to small airways disease or
 emphysema.  Mild interstitial abnormality is unlikely due to cardiac
 decompensation because heart size is normal, pulmonary vasculature is not
 overcirculated and there is no pleural effusion.  It could be related to
 smoking or asthma or bronchial infection.  Findings need to be correlated with
 clinical circumstances, and followed with repeat radiographs if symptoms do
 not resolve.  
 
 There is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
