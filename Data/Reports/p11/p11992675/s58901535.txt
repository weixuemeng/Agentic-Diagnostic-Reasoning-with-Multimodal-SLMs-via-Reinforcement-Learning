                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chills and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The left cardiac contour probably
 corresponding to the atrial appendage appears somewhat prominent and central
 pulmonary arteries are probably slightly enlarged.  There is a mild
 interstitial process with Kerley B lines, particularly evident in the right
 lung, and this suggests mild vascular congestion.  There is exaggerated
 kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine and a lower thoracolumbar mild
 superior endplate compression deformity that is age indeterminant.  The bones
 appear demineralized.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of mild pulmonary congestion.
