                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with failure to thrive after recent admission for
 pneumonitis presents with increased dyspnea, dysphagia somnolence and
 decreased PO intake
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning.  Lung volumes remain low.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures persists without overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is continued patchy opacities in both lung bases,
 which may reflect atelectasis and/or aspiration, not substantially changed in
 the interval.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Fracture of the left sixth posterior rib is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. 
 Continued bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and/or aspiration.  No new focal consolidation.
