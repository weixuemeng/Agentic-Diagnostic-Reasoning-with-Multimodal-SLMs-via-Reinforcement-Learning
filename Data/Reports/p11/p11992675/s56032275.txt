                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, dysphagia and productive cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  The aorta appears diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are not substantially changed in the interval.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is noted and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 likely present.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient rotation.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
