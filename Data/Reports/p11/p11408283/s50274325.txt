                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, left lower lung crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unchanged, with
 a small hiatal hernia noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There is mild retrolisthesis at the thoracolumbar junction,
 unchanged, likely T12 on L1 and L1 on L2.  Mild loss of height of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body is also stable.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 compatible with underlying COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
