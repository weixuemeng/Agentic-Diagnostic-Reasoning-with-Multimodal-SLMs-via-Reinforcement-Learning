                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with impaction with pneumomediastinum  // food
 impaction, pneumomediastinum eval
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous imaging studies on PACs record for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the visualized portion of the lower left
 neck.  There is a small focus of lucency at the extreme upper apex of the left
 lung.  This could be due to some overlying subcutaneous emphysema. A tiny left
 apical pneumothorax is considered less likely, but is not entirely excluded.
 
 In addition, there is equivocal minimal air to the left of the trachea,
 adjacent the left lung apex --___ real, this could represent a very small
 amount of pneumomediastinum.
 
 Elsewhere, no evidence of pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is otherwise within normal limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion
 detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema over the lower left neck and question over the left
 lung apex.  A tiny left apical pneumothorax is in the differential for the
 latter finding, but is considered less likely.  No other evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Equivocal minimal lucency to the left of the trachea could lie within the
 mediastinum or could represent overlying subcutaneous emphysema.  No other
 evidence of pneumomediastinum is detected.
 
 Otherwise no acute pulmonary process.
