                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal perforation  // Please assess for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___:00.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen ET tube has been removed and replaced with a mask which
 overlies portions of the left neck, at the site of previously seen
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Technical factors limit re-evaluation of areas where
 subcutaneous emphysema and possible paratracheal emphysema was seen on the
 prior study.
 
 Relative lucency along the right mediastinal contour could reset represent
 either ___ ___ artifact or small amount of pneumomediastinum.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, with probable mild
 cardiomegaly.
 
 Of note, there are faint alveolar opacities at both lung bases, that appear to
 have progressed compared with 1 day earlier.  There is minimal , if any, upper
 zone redistribution, making CHF unlikely.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Alveolar opacities at both bases, new or considerably progressed compared with
 1 day earlier.  No upper zone redistribution to suggest CHF.  Clinical
 correlation is requested.  These could reflect bibasilar pneumonic infectious
 infiltrates or areas of aspiration pneumonitis.  Other etiologies for alveolar
 opacities remain in the differential.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly, similar to prior.
 
 No gross pneumomediastinum, though linear lucency along the right mediastinum
 could reflect either trace mediastinal air or more likely ___ artifact.
 
 Areas where gas was previously seen about the neck pain and question upper
 trachea are not well visualized on the current study, in part due to overlying
 O2 mask.
