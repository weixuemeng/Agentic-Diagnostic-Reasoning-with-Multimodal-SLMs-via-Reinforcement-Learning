                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 PA chest abd LAT chest radiograph.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Mediastinal position is
 slightly shifted to the left.  There is right middle lobe
 consolidation/atelectasis.  There is also suspected basal loculated
 pneumothorax on the right.  Air-fluid level on the left projecting to the left
 of the spine is of unclear origin.  It potentially may represent a slightly
 higher than usual position of the stomach but loculated hydropneumothorax
 cannot be excluded.  Correlation with decubitus view might be considered. 
 Multiple rib fractures are noted.
