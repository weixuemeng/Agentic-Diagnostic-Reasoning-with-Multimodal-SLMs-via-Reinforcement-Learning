                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 lung volumes are low, which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Aside from minimal left lower lobe
 atelectasis, lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
