                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, dropping O2 saturation, assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 Comparison is made with a CT abdomen and pelvis from earlier today at an OSH.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Pleural thickening and
 atelectasis at the right lung base is better assessed on the prior CT abdomen
 and pelvis.  There are calcified granulomas scattered throughout both lungs. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen. There is a prominent right epicardial fat
 pad which obscures the right heart border better seen on prior CT. Heart size
 is grossly within normal limits though better assessed on the outside hospital
 CT.  Mediastinal contour likely reflects vascular ectasia.  Bony structures
 appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis and pleural thickening.  Calcified
 granulomas.  No definite acute intrathoracic process.
