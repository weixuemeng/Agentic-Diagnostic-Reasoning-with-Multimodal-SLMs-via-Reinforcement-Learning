                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with afib, hypotension  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded. Ill-defined opacity at the left base on the
 frontal projection is not confirmed on the lateral and may reflect a
 pericardial fat pad. The heart is not enlarged. The mediastinal hilar contours
 are normal. Mild blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulcus may reflect a
 small pleural effusion of unclear laterality. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 A curvilinear opacity just under the medial right hemidiaphragm is likely
 contained within bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Faint opacity at the left base likely reflects pericardial fat pad, less
 likely pneumonia.
 2. Curvilinear opacity at the medial right hemidiaphragm is likely contained
 within bowel. Intraperitoneal free air is difficult to exclude completely,
 however a left lateral decubitus radiograph of the abdomen should be able to
 answer the question.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were telephoned to ___ by ___ at
 00:30, ___, ___ min after discovery.
