                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with smoking history, COPD and worsening
 lung exam, question pneumonia, fluid overload effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:35.
 
 Portably AP upright chest film ___ at 11:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated with areas of increased lucency, particularly in the left upper
 lung.  These findings are consistent with underlying emphysema.  Chain sutures
 are seen at the right apex consistent with previous thoracic surgery.  A
 single clip is also seen projecting within the fifth right interspace. 
 Streaky linear opacities in the right mid and left lower lobe likely reflect
 scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal airspace consolidations is
 seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
