                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with GI bleed, presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffusely increased parenchymal opacities,
 cardiomediastinal and hilar enlargement and indistinctness is consistent with
 new mild pulmonary edema.  A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 Asymmetric increased density of the left base may be due to asymmetric edema,
 though pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with increasing bilateral
 effusions.  Increased left basilar opacity may be due to asymmetric edema,
 though pneumonia is possible.  Recommend repeat radiograph after diuresis.
