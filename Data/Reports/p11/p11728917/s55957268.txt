                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval improvement in extent of pulmonary edema, with residual
 mild interstitial edema remaining.  Streaky peribronchiolar opacities in the
 lung bases have also improved, and may reflect resolving bronchovascular
 edema.  However, continued followup radiographs would be helpful to document
 resolution and to exclude the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  There are
 no pleural effusions.  Lungs are relatively hyperexpanded with flattening of
 hemidiaphragms on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving pulmonary edema.  Followup radiographs are suggested to
 document complete resolution as described above.
