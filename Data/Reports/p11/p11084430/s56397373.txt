                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain.  // R/O CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the prior study. There is prominence of
 interstitial markings bilaterally likely due to pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The left basilar opacity is
 likely due to atelectasis as no pleural effusion is visible on the lateral
 projection. There is mild cardiomegaly.  The left hilar contour is enlarged
 likely due to an enlarged pulmonary artery. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild new pulmonary vascular congestion and left basilar atelectasis.
