                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged from chest radiograph ___.  Bilateral
 hilar enlargement is compatible with enlargement of the bilateral pulmonary
 arteries as seen on CT chest ___.  There are bibasilar opacities
 which likely represent atelectasis, however an infectious etiology cannot be
 ruled out.  Degenerative changes of the lower thoracic spine.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema or pleural effusions is
 demonstrated.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities which likely represent atelectasis, however an
 infectious etiology cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2.  Cardiomegaly grossly unchanged from ___ with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 3.  Pulmonary arterial enlargement suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
