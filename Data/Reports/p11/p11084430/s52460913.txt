                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS: Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is calcified.  The contour of the aortopulmonary window is again prominent,
 reflecting enlargement of the main pulmonary artery as seen on the prior CT in
 addition to stability from the prior radiographs.  The lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Small-to-moderate osteophytes
 are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.  Similar enlargement of central
 pulmonary arteries.
