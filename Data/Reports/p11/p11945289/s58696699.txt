                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CP please evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  In
 the retrocardiac region, subtle interval increase in density compared to the
 prior exam is likely positional.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. There
 is no large pleural effusion, pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle interval increase in density in the retrocardiac region is likely
 positional, and less likely secondary to a focal consolidation.
