                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with left lateral lower rib
 pain.  Assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator overlies the left
 chest wall.  The leads appear intact projecting over the expected location of
 the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged from prior.  The lungs are
 clear.  No confluent opacity is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 large pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Numerous bilateral healed rib fractures are identified and
 appear similar to prior.  Well-corticated oval fragments seen bilaterally in
 the mid-lung regions likely reflect the sequelae of prior trauma.  Deformity
 of the left acromioclavicular joint from prior trauma is unchanged from prior.
 There is loss of height of the T11 vertebral body, which is unchanged from
 prior CT.  No definite acute fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No definite acute fracture. 
 Numerous healed rib fractures and left shoulder deformity from prior trauma.
