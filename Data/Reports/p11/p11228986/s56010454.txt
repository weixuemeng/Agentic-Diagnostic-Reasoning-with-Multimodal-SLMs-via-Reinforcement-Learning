                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure and renal failure  //
 please evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multifocal parenchymal airspace opacities are not significantly changed
 compared to prior study but have progressed since ___.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The pleural surfaces are
 normal.  The left PICC line still terminates near the brachiocephalic/ SVC
 junction and is unchanged.  The right pacemaker is intact with leads
 terminating in the appropriate positions.  Stable multiple healed left-sided
 rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged multifocal opacities likely represent an infectious process rather
 than heart failure.  Unchanged position of left PICC line.
