                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, fatigue now with leukocytosis and
 hyperbilirubinemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle, similar to the previous study.  Mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is present with a left ventricular predominance.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the lung bases.  A trace left
 pleural effusion is present.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Remote chronic left-sided rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Trace left pleural effusion.
