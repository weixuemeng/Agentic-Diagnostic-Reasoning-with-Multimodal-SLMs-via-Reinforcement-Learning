                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure  //
 pulmonary edema or new infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's chin obscures the medial portion of both lung apices.
 
 Retro density may be slightly increased, consistent with slight progression of
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Diffuse increased interstitial
 markings probably similar allowing for technical differences. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by the left base opacity,
 but appears grossly unchanged.  Right-sided dual lead pacemaker similar prior.
 Overlies the lower portion of the right lung.  Allowing for this, no right
 lung frank consolidation.  No right effusion.  Minimal blunting of left
 costophrenic L could reflect a small left effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial markings are similar to the prior film.  These are
 similar, but increased compared with ___, raising the possibility
 of an acute on chronic process.  Allowing for technical differences, they do
 not appear significant change compared with ___.
 
 Slight progression in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Small
 left effusion.
