                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of longstanding tobacco
 use, adventitial breath sounds bilateral on the bases.  Assess for fluid,
 infiltrate, mass.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.
 There is moderate cardiac enlargement as before.  Configuration is
 characterized by a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the
 left and posteriorly and the appearance of a double contour in the right heart
 shadow suggests left atrial enlargement of moderate degree.  The thoracic
 aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows some calcium deposits in
 the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern, but there is no evidence
 of interstitial or alveolar edema.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 remain free from any fluid accumulation and no pneumothorax is seen in the
 apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 When comparison is made with the next previous examination of ___, the cardiac enlargement existed already at that time.  The upper zone
 re-distribution pattern was not as marked as it is now.  On the other hand,
 some local parenchymal infiltrates that were appreciated previously on the
 left lung base cannot be identified anymore.
 
 Stable cardiomegaly but signs of beginning increasing left-sided filling
 pressure.  No evidence of acute infiltrates in this ___-year-old female patient
 with history of smoking.
