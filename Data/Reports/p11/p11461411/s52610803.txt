                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left rib pain after fall, worse with
 inspiration.  Evaluate for evidence of fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, with a prominent right atrium, suggesting high pulmonary pressure. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 prominent right epicardial fat is noted.  No fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process or fracture.  
 
 Of note, this exam is not tailored for evaluation of fine detail of thoracic
 osseous structures.  If there is concern for bony injuries detailed views
 should be obtained.
