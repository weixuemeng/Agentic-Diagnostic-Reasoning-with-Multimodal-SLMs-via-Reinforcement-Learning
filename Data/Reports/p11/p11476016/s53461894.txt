                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p right central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in the
 lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  Heart size is top normal. 
 The aorta is minimally tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates minimal engorgement without frank pulmonary edema. 
 No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
