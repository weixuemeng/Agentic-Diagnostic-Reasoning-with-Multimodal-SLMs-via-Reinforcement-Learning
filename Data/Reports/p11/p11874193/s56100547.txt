                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carinal. An
 orogastric tube is difficult to follow due to underpenetration but apparently
 proceeds into the stomach. Within the limitations of AP portable technique
 with low lung volumes, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 probably within normal limits. Vague hazy opacity in the left costophrenic
 cysts angle may indicate atelectasis, perhaps trace effusion. Otherwise, lung
 fields appear clear. There is no evidence of pleural effusion on the right
 side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation. Perhaps trace pleural effusion or
 atelectasis on the left, but generally speaking, clear lungs.
