                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with biliary obstruction/cholangitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  Subtle posterior lung base densities are demonstrated corresponding
 to areas of ground-glass opacity on the recent CT examination likely
 representing a small component of aspiration and certainly do not look
 worsened compared to prior study.  These densities have no frontal correlate. 
 There are tiny layering posterior bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Redemonstration of a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Redemonstration of subtle posterior lung base densities corresponding to
 ground-glass opacities on prior CT and likely representing aspiration do not
 appear worsened.  Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
