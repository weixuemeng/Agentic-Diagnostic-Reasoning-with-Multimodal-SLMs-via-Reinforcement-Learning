                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, chills, emesis, weakness.  History of liver cancer with
 biliary stent placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 posteriorly are similar when compared to the previous exam, and could reflect
 areas of atelectasis or aspiration.  Small bilateral pleural effusions appear
 similar.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated, and there is no
 pneumothorax. Metallic biliary stent is noted in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities posteriorly could reflect aspiration
 or atelectasis.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
