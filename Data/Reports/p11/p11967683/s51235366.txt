                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of central line placement, confirm line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine chest radiograph was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central line terminates in the right
 atrium.  Lung volumes are slightly low. Prominence of the pulmonary vascular
 is consistent with pulmonary congestion.  Linear opacities at the bases likely
 represent atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The
 imaged upper abdomen demonstrates a metallic common bile duct stent.  The
 bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Right internal jugular central line within the right atrium. 
 2. Pulmonary congestion.
