                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Severe agitation.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low with bronchovascular crowding, likely accounting for the subtle lower lung
 opacities.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of pneumonia.  Limited exam due to low lung volumes.
