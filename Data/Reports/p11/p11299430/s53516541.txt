 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post colectomy, evaluation for pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques and moderate cardiomegaly.  Known
 pneumoperitoneum.  Unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic sinuses might indicate small pleural effusions. 
 The sternal wires are in unchanged alignment.
