                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with asthma, duodenitis being worked up,
 eosinophilia and now with shortness of breath  // evaluate for pulmonary
 edema, infiltrates, lymphadenopathy     evaluate for pulmonary edema,
 infiltrates, lymphadenopathy
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacification projects over the right lower lung at the level of the 6
 through 8 anterior ribs, and at the level of the right second anterior
 interspace, and on the left lateral to the cardiac apex.  I would recommend
 confirming these abnormalities with conventional chest radiographs when
 feasible, but they may be due to early atypical pneumonia.
 
 Heart is normal size.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
