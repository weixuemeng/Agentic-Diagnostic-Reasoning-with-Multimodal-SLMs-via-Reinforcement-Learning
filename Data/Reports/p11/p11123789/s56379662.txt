                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  Abdominal pain and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is mildly prominent central interstitial
 opacification with areas of peribronchial cuffing, although similar to the
 prior examination.  There is no free air.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 inflammatory or infectious process of lower airways or atypical pneumonia
 could be considered as possible etiologies.
