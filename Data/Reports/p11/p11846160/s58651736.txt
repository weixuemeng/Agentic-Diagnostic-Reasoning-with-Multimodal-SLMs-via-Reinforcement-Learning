 unchanged, and the appearance of the thoracic aorta is unaltered.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No new acute pulmonary infiltrates

 sinus extending into the posterior area.  The left hemithorax is free and no
 pleural effusion is found on this side.

 remaining blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus.  When comparing the
 present study with that similar PA and lateral chest examination of ___, however, the amount of pleural effusion is unchanged and rather small.
