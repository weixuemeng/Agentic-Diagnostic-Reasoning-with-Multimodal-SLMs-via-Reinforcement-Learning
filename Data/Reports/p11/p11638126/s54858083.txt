                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic carcinoma after lung biopsy.  Assess
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to 4:10 p.m.:
 
 There is no appreciable left apical pneumothorax.  Severe bullous emphysema
 makes it difficult to exclude any pleural air at all, but there has been no
 change over the past three hours to suggest an air leak.  Nor is there any
 pleural effusion.  Aside from the severe emphysema and left apical lung mass
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
