                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of MVC, head struck.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Underlying
 trauma board partially obscures the view.  Given this, the visualized lung
 fields show no evidence of focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The very superior lung apices may not be
 fully included on the image.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen, although again the
 superior lung apices may be excluded from the image.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Superior lung apices may not be fully included on the image. 
 Otherwise, no evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
