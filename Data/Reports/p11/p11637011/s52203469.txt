 INDICATION:  HIV, cough and fever to 104 degrees.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Consolidative opacity in the right
 upper lobe is concerning for pneumonia.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe, compatible with
 pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution of this finding.
