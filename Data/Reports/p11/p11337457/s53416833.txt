                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, now with NG tube, central venous line and ETT.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube ending 2.9
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is within the stomach.  The left central
 venous catheter has an unusual course with the tip projecting to the left of
 midline over the aortic arch.  This could represent arterial placement or
 placement in the small vein but does not appear to be within the central
 venous structures.  Otherwise, there is stable appearance of the chest with
 normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours.  The right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from this image.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 3:30 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
