                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right upper lobe bronchoscopic biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CT torso from ___ and chest
 radiograph from ___ and fluoroscopic images from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a new opacity in the
 right upper lobe likely representing hemorrhage status post bronchoscopic
 biopsy or, if a lavage was performed, this could also represent a post-lavage
 appearance.  There is no pneumothorax seen.  Diffuse interstitial opacities
 are seen, consistent with mild interstitial edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are seen.  There is mild cardiomegaly, stable from previous imaging.
 Pacer is in left anterior axillary position with intact leads in the expected
 course to the right atrium and right ventricle.  Sternotomy wires and CABG
 clips are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right upper lobe opacity likely representing
 post-bronchoscopy hemorrhage.  Mild interstitial edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
