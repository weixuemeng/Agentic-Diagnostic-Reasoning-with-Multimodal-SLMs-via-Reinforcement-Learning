                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker with leads again terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic
 arch is calcified.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a widespread mild interstitial abnormality which is of
 uncertain chronicity.  This is most confluent in the lower lungs and in
 subpleural regions.  Although a component of this may be due to pulmonary
 vascular congestion, intrinsic interstitial lung disease is an additional
 consideration to consider.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggest
 atelectasis, not significantly changed.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 Mild degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality, most prominent along costophrenic angles,
 which could be seen with a component of mild vascular congestion, but the
 possibility of a more chronic abnormality such as intrinsic lung disease
 should also be considered.  
 
 2.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis, not significantly changed and accordingly
 suggestive of chronic scarring.
