                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of  breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Mild upper zone vascular redistribution is
 present compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  New ill-defined
 patchy opacities are seen within the lung bases, findings which may reflect
 infection or aspiration in the correct clinical setting, with an element of
 atelectasis also present.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally
 appear relatively unchanged which may reflect chronic pleural thickening or
 trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar patchy opacities which may reflect infection or aspiration in the
 correct clinical setting superimposed with atelectasis.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions or chronic pleural thickening.
