                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with vomiting of tube feeds now tachycardic and
 tachypnic. CXR to evaluate for PNA or other pulmonary etilogy.  // CXR to eval
 for PNA or other pulmonary etiology of tachycardia and tachypnea.     CXR to
 eval for PNA or other pulmonary etiology of tachycard
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobhoff tube again extends to the
 mid to lower stomach before coiling back on itself so that the opaque tip is
 in the fundus.  Areas of increased opacification are again seen bilaterally. 
 Although possibly merely reflecting atelectasis, in view of the clinical
 history of the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  If clinically possible, a lateral view would be helpful.
