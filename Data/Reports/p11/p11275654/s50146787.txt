                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above
 the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach although the
 sidehole indicator projects over the distal esophagus.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable aside from mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Status post endotracheal
 intubation.  Orogastric tube reaching the stomach, although if clinically
 indicated, advancing the tube by about ___-15 cm could be helpful for better
 seating and to place the sidehole marker within the stomach.
