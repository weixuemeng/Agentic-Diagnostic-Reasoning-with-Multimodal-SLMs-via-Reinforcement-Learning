                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 1 portable AP upright view of the chest.  There is marked enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  There has been an interval increase in pulmonary vascular
 engorgement and pulmonary edema.  No definite pleural effusion however there
 may be a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  More confluent
 opacity in the right lung base likely represents engorged pulmonary
 vasculature/edema however pneumonia cannot be completely ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Marked enlargement of cardiac silhouette and moderate pulmonary edema.  More
 confluent opacity in the right lower lobe likely represents engorged
 vessels/edema however pneumonia cannot be entirely ruled out.  Possible small
 left pleural effusion.
