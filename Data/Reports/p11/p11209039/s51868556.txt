                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting with cough, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been complete
 clearing of the right basilar opacification.  Substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette in the absence of vascular congestion suggests underlying
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  No acute focal pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
