                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Mild compression
 deformities are noted among at least four upper thoracic vertebral bodies. 
 These are age-indeterminate, although without features to suggest that they
 are likely to be recent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 Several upper thoracic compression deformities, age-indeterminate.
