                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ at 12:58.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right Port-A-Cath terminates at the upper right atrium.  The heart size is
 normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits.  The
 lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding, however, there is
 no central pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  No pleural effusion is
 detected, although the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the view. 
 There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  There is relative paucity of
 bowel gas, limiting evaluation for bowel dilation.  No free air is detected.
