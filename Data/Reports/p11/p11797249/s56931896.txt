  No free intraperitoneal air.  The lucent focus seen on the prior exam appears
  to have more defined bowel marking and is most consistent with a prominent air
  filled loop of large bowel, which is not unexpected after colonoscopy.  Air
  filled loops of bowel are seen throughout the upper abdomen.  Unchanged low
  lung volumes, elevation of the hemidiaphragms and cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain after colonoscopy, evaluation for free air under
 the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is better visibility
 of the subdiaphragmatic areas.  A slightly hyperinflated colonic loop is seen
 at the level of the right upper quadrant.  However, there is no evidence of
 free intra-abdominal air on the current radiograph.  If the clinical
 presentation persists, however, an alternative imaging technique with higher
 sensitivity such as an abdominal radiograph or a CT should be considered.
 
 The lung volumes remain low.  Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
