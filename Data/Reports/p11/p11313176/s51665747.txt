                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 portable film from ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.  There is blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle which is
 unchanged and likely in part due to extrapleural fat and possible pleural
 thickening which is partially visualized on prior CT abdomen.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Previously seen left-sided tunneled IJ
 line is no longer visualized.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
