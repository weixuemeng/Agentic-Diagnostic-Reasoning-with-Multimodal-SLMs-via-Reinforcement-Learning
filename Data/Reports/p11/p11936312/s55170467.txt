                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD s/p 4vCABG, s/p PEA and VT arrest.  //
 Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval extubation.  Lung volumes are relatively low.  A 1.4 cm nodular
 opacity in the lateral left lung is unchanged.  Central lucency is raises the
 possibility of cavitation.  A linear density projecting over the left heart
 border is unchanged.  Trace left pleural effusion.  Top normal heart size is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  A median
 sternotomy wires are midline, some fractured, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval extubation, but otherwise no significant change.
 2. Persistent lateral left lung nodular opacity with features raising the
 possibility of cavitation.  Recommend nonurgent dedicated CT for further
 evaluation.
 
 3. Probable pleural plaque overlying the left heart border.  Correlation with
 asbestos exposure history recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Persistent lateral left lung nodular opacity with features
 raising the possibility of cavitation.  Recommend nonurgent dedicated CT for
 further evaluation.
