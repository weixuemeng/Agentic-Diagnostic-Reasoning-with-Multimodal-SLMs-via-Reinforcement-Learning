                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest now intubated  // Evaluate ET
 tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  Lung volumes are low
 with bibasilar atelectasis.  Linear density projecting over the lateral left
 heart border may reflect a dense focus of linear atelectasis or pleural
 plaque.  There is an apparent 1.5 cm cavitary lesion with a relatively thick
 rim in the lateral mid left lung.  Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The 2 most superior median sternotomy wires are fractured in
 multiple places.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ETT terminates 6 cm above the carina.
 2. Fractured median sternotomy wires.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt edema.
 4. Apparent 1.5 cm cavitary lesion in the lateral mid left lung.  Recommend
 dedicated PA and lateral radiographs for further evaluation,when feasible.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Apparent 1.5 cm cavitary lesion in the lateral mid left
 lung.  Recommend dedicated PA and lateral radiographs for further
 evaluation,when feasible.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
