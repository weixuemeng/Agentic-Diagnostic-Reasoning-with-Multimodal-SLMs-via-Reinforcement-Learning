                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for six weeks, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no
 acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
