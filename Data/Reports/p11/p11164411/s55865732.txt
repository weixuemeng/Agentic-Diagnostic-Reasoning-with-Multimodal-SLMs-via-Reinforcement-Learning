                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior CTA chest from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rapid AFib, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valve are again noted.  The heart is
 enlarged with a LV configuration.  Mild atelectasis is noted at the lung
 bases, not significantly changed from prior.  There is no definite sign of
 pneumonia or overt CHF.  The overall cardiomediastinal contour appears stable.
 Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly again noted without overt signs of CHF or pneumonia.
 Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
