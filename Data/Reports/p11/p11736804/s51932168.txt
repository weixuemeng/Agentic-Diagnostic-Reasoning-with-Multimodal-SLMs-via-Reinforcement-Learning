                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest congestion x 2 weeks  // eval for
 consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volume has decreased both on
 the right and on the left.  On both the frontal and the lateral radiograph,
 there is a minimal increase in reticular structures, potentially reflecting a
 chronic interstitial process.  The findings could be clarified with CT, based
 on the improved spatial resolution of this technique. Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.  No pulmonary
 edema.  .
