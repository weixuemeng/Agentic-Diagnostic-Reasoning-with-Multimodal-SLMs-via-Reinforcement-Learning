                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Allowing for this, heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is a
 left-sided dual-lead pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is some patchy opacity at both lung bases, with some
 crowding of vessels in the right middle and question left lower zones.  There
 is blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly where some patchy
 opacity is also likely present.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity at both lung bases, question right middle and left
 lower lobe.  Although nonspecific, the differential diagnosis includes
 infectious infiltrates.  Inflammatory infiltrates and aspiration could have a
 similar appearance.  No gross effusion.
