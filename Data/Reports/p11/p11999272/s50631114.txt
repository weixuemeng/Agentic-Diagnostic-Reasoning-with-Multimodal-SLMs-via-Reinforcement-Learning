                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right IJ, evaluate line.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:10 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, a right IJ central line has been placed.  The
 tip overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
