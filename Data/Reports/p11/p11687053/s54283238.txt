                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Myeloma, right lower lobe pneumonia and effusions, evaluation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusion on the
 right has mildly increased.  As a consequence, the opacity in the right lower
 lobe also appears slightly more severe than on the previous exam.  There is
 slightly increasing evidence of fluid overload, as reflected by an increase in
 diameter of the pulmonary vasculature.  The heart continues to be enlarged.
