                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer now
 with hypoxia and cough.  Please evaluate for evidence of progression of
 disease or infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The position of the AICD appears to be stable.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Trachea is midline and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 The opacity within the left upper lobe corresponding to the primary lung
 malignancy is now more hazy and diffuse with corresponding loss of volume
 within the left upper lobe resulting in a slight upward shift of the left
 hilum.  There is also an interval development of a left-sided moderate pleural
 effusion and compressive atelectasis.  An overlying consolidation cannot be
 ruled out.  There is a slight worsening of the small patchy infiltrates within
 the right base compared to the prior study.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures appear to be intact and there does not seem to be any evidence
 of bone destruction in the proximity of the primary malignancy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse hazy changes of the known left upper opacity with volume loss.
 2.  New moderate left-sided pleural effusion with evidence of compressive
 atelectasis.  An overlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  In the proper
 clinical context, pneumonia could be considered.
