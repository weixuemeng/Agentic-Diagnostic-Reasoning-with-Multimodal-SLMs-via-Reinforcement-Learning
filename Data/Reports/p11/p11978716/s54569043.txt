                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:54 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with worsening hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Worsening opacification at both lung bases could be explained by increasing
 moderate pleural effusion, left greater than right, worsening atelectasis, in
 the setting of slightly progressing interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Nevertheless, heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are not particularly
 dilated.  CT scanning would be very helpful in assessing and corroborating
 these findings.  No pneumothorax.
