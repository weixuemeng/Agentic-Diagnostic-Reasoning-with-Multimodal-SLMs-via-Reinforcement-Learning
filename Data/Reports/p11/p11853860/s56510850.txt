                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness, history of thalamic CVA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate subtle bilateral
 perihilar opacities with obscuration of the right heart border seen only on
 frontal view.  In the proper clinical setting, this could represent infection,
 likely aspiration.  The heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
