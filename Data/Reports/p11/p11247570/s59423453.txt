                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy bibasilar opacities are new, and could reflect patchy
 atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with persistent hiatal hernia.  Small
 right pleural effusion is present, and has likely increased in size since
 recent CT.
