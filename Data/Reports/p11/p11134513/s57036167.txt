 A right chest tube remains in place and there continues to be extensive right
 lateral chest wall and bilateral neck soft tissue subcutaneous emphysema.  The
 right apical pneumothorax is barely appreciable on the current study. Opacity
 at the right base with an associated effusion and patchy opacity at the left
 base are likely not significantly changed.  The vasculature appears slightly
 more prominent than on previous studies which is of uncertain significance. 
 No overt pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised.
