                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M s/p Vats RML lobectomy.  // eval pneumo, effusion and subt
 air      eval pneumo, effusion and subt air
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 14:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ 01:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right chest tube remains in place and there is a stable small right apical
 pneumothorax which extends medially. The overlying subcutaneous emphysema
 within the chest wall and neck soft tissues and pneumomediastinum is likely
 not significantly changed.  There is a layering right effusion. Lung volumes
 are low with crowding of the vasculature.  There is increasing opacity at the
 left base with a stable patchy opacity at the right base. Although these
 findings may reflect atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 Clinical correlation is advised.
