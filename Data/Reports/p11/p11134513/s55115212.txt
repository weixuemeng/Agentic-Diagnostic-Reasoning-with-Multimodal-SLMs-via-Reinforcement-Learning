                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ w lung cancer s/p VATS right lobectomy.  // eval pneumo after
 clamp trial      eval pneumo after clamp trial
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 15:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right chest tube remains in place.  No right apical pneumothorax is seen.
 There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the neck and
 right lateral chest wall soft tissues.  Lung volumes remain low with patchy
 bibasilar opacities which favors partial lower lobe atelectasis. There is
 likely a small layering right effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is now less
 prominent suggesting that there was an element of superimposed interstitial
 edema on the prior study.  No pulmonary edema is present at this time. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in
 positioning between studies.
