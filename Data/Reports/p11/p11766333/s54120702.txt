                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia and new onset CHF  // ?worsening
 pulmonary edema vs pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 03:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy and left sided PICC line are again seen.  The PICC line tip
 is slightly more distally now lies at the SVC/RA junction.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Allowing for technical
 differences, it is grossly unchanged.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
 again noted.
 
 As before, there is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 likely with a small to moderate left effusion.  The degree of retrocardiac
 opacification is slightly worse.
 
 Also again seen is a small to moderate right pleural effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study.
 
 There is minimal , if any, upper zone redistribution.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains present.  Left-sided PICC line tip lies slightly
 more distal, now at the SVC/RA junction.
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Minimal, if any, CHF.
 
 Left-greater-than-right lung base collapse and/or pneumonic consolidation and
 small to moderate left-greater-than-right pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac
 opacity has progressed slightly compared with a film from 1 day earlier.
