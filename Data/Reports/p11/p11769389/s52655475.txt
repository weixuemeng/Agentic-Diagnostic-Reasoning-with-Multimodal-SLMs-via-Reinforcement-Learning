                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, pleuritic in nature.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette appears normal and unchanged compared to the prior examination.
 Mild mediastinal prominence is likely related to differences in patient
 positioning and technique.  The lungs demonstrate low volumes as before, but
 are otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion
 and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If high clinical concern, CT would confirm.
