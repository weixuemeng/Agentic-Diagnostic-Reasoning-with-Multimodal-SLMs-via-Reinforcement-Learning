                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with autonomic neuropathy and recurrent pneumonia.
 Two weeks of persistent cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A new 3 cm long band-like nearly a crescentic opacity projecting over the left
 upper lung along the margin of the first anterior rib is new.  I suspect it is
 external, which should be confirmed with a repeat frontal radiograph performed
 with the patient disrobed to the waist with her hair placed out of the field
 of view.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 and pleural surfaces are normal.  Lateral view demonstrates more pronounced
 hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragm contours than seen previously
 consistent with small airways obstruction, which would explain symptoms.
 
 Our ___ supervisor will contact the patient directly to schedule a
 repeat frontal chest film.
