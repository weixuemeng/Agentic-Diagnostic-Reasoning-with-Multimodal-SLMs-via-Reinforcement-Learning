                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with peripheral vascular disease, presents with
 claudication of the left lower extremity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits, and there is no evidence for pulmonary
 edema.  Streaky and linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
