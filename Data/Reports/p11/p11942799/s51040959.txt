                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the central pulmonary vasculature.  Peribronchial
 cuffing is present in the right juxtahilar region with adjacent nonspecific
 patchy right infrahilar opacity.  An azygos fissure is incidentally noted. 
 There is no consolidation or pneumothorax.  A left pleural effusion is small. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Right juxtahilar peribronchial cuffing would could reflect bronchitis in
 the appropriate clinical setting. Adjacent patchy right infrahilar opacity
 could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia.
 
 Short-term follow-up imaging is recommended.
