                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately to severely enlarged.  No pleural effusion or
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is minimal interstitial edema. 
 Right-sided PICC is again seen, distal aspect not well seen, likely due to
 overlying left-sided AICD lead.  Single-lead left AICD is seen with lead
 grossly similar in position.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aortic
 knob is again calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 minimal interstitial edema.
