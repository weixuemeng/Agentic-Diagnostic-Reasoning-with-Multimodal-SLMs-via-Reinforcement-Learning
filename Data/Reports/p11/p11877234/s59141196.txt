 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC has migrated proximally and terminates in the right
 subclavian vein, high in position.  Single lead left AICD is seen, unchanged
 position.  Severe cardiomegaly is again seen. The mediastinal contours are
 stable. Aortic knob calcification is again seen. Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is worrisome for a small left pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis.  Previously seen right pleural effusion has decreased
 in the interval with possible trace remaining.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.
