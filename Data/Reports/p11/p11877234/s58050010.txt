                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC line  // ?PICC line in place      ?PICC
 line in place
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13 25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 16 42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line has its tip at in the proximal SVC. A single lead
 left-sided pacer is incompletely visualized but the lead appears intact and
 unchanged in overall position. The heart remains markedly enlarged which may
 reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion could also have this
 appearance. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the
 current study but there do appear to be layering bilateral effusions with
 associated patchy airspace disease likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. 
 There has been interval appearance of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
