                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent PICC placement with concern for displacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  PICC line placement ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest  radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been slight interval withdrawal of the right-sided PICC
 as compared to prior examination with the tip now terminating 1.2 cm cranial
 to the carina at the level of the proximal-to-mid SVC.  A left-sided ICD with
 a single right ventricular lead is unchanged in position compared to prior
 examination.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There are
 likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight withdrawal of a right-sided PICC, now terminating in the proximal
 to mid SVC remaining in acceptable position.
 2.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
