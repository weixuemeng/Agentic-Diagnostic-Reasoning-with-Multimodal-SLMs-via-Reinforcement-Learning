 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:58 PM
  A right-sided PICC terminates in knee proximal SVC, similar in appearance to
  the prior exam. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion as well as bilateral
  hilar opacities are suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity
  as well as a small are most likely atelectasis opacity at the base of the
  right lung however infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical
  setting. Stable cardiomegaly. Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with end stage CHF admitted for symptom control.
 Please confirm PICC placement prior to use  // confirm PICC location    
 confirm PICC location
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PIC line ends just before the origin of the SVC.  Transvenous right
 ventricular pacemaker lead unchanged in position with the tip oriented toward
 the floor of the middle third of the right ventricle.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  Pulmonary edema is mild and small right pleural effusion has
 decreased substantially since ___.  Small left pleural effusion
 however is larger and is probably accompanied by some left basal atelectasis,
 obscured by cardiac silhouette.  There is no pneumothorax.
