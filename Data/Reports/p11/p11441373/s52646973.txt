                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ARDS.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained on ___ timed at
 5:06 a.m. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ timed at 5:32 a.m.
 
 REPORT:  The ET tube is in unchanged position approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  The right-sided subclavian line is unchanged in position.  Clips are
 noted over the right chest wall.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 There is bibasilar interstitial reaction, although this is essentially
 unchanged from before.  There are findings suggestive of some interstitial
 pulmonary infiltrates also.
 
 Right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position.  A small amount of surgical
 emphysema is also seen.  
 
 An NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum but its tip is now retracted
 probably and lies in a retrocardiac position, possibly within a hiatal hernia
 and unchanged from before.
 
 The right-sided consolidation is unchanged from before.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Very little interval change from before.
