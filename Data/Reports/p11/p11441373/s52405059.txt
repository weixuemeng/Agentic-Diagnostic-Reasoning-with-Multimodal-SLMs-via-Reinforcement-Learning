                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post esophageal dilation.  Evaluate the post-operative
 exam.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status-post a gastric-pull up for esophageal cancer.
 A large bubble of air overlying the right hemithorax is air within the
 thoracic portion of the stomach.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax.  A small linear right basilar opacity likely reflects chronic
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no new opacity,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
