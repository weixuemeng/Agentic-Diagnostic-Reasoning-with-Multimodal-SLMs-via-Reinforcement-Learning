                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:01 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with acute decompensation.  Question interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 11:11 a.m.:
 
 Severe pulmonary consolidation in both lungs which spread from the right lung
 to the left over the past 48 hours has not improved.  Since the cardiac
 silhouette has also gotten larger this could be pulmonary edema, though
 pulmonary hemorrhage or pneumonia may have been responsible for the initial
 consolidation in the right lung.  Another possibility is development of
 pericardial effusion which would require echocardiography or CT scanning for
 detection.  Newly placed endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Right
 pleural tube unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone.
