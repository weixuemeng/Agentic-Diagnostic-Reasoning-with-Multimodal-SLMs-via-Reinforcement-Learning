                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Delirium.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 8 hours earlier.
 
 Increasing opacities in the left perihilar region are worrisome for
 aspiration.  Small left effusion is increasing.  Right perihilar and lower
 lobe opacities have increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  There is mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.  Central
 line and right chest tube remain in unchanged position.  Right subcutaneous
 emphysema is stable.  Central catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
