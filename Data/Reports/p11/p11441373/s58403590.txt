                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post esophagectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 New opacity projecting in the right lower hemithorax is a combination of a
 neoesophagus and adjacent atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small bilateral pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size is top normal accentuated by the low lung volumes.  Nasogastric
 tube projects over the right chest likely in the neoesophagus, the tip is at
 the level of the hemidiaphragm.  Right-sided chest tubes are in appropriate
 position.  Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the upper SVC.
