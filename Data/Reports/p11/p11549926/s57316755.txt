                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hyperglycemia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 7mm round opacities projecting over
 each ___ anterior interspace are probably nipple shadows, but because they are
 of different attenuation, their identity should be confirmed with SHALLOW
 OBLIQUE  views employing nipple markers. The lungs are otherwise clear. No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
