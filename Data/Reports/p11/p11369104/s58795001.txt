                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, fever, myalgia, cough, abnormal lung sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Hazy ill-defined opacity in the left
 lung base may reflect pneumonia.  Persistent branching opacity within the
 right upper lobe again may reflect bronchiectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy ill-defined opacity in the left lung base is concerning for infection. 
 Persistent branching tubular opacity in the right upper lobe, likely
 reflective of bronchiectasis.
