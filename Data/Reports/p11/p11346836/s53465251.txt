                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis in a patient status post recent nephrectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed earlier the same date. 
 Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest, semi-upright AP.  There are linear opacities in the left lower lobe
 with blunting of the costophrenic angles, which is explained by scarring and
 pleural calcifications seen on the CT.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
