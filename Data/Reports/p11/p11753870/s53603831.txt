                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with gastric pulmonary
 fistula, presented with pneumonia and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___, ___ and ___ as well as chest CT from ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates persistent right lower lobe consolidation mostly
 located posteriorly, slightly progressed since ___, most likely
 reflecting persistent communication between the stomach and the lung. 
 Previously suspected area of cavitation is not definitively seen on the
 current study.  Smaller opacities are noted in the right upper lung, unchanged
 since the prior study and might potentially reflect post-radiation changes. 
 Left lung is essentially clear.  Small amount of right pleural effusion is
 noted.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.
