                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal CA and tracheoesophageal fistula, question worsening
 opacities.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  The heart is not enlarged.  Vertical lucency and opacity to the right
 of mediastinal are consistent with esophageal surgery.  There is dense patchy
 opacity at the right base and to a lesser extent in the right mid zone, with a
 small right effusion.  The left lung is grossly clear, except for minimal
 atelectasis or scarring at the base.
 
 Compared with ___, the opacity at the right base is more heterogeneous and
 the possibility of an area of cavitation cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, no
 significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Persistent patchy opacities in the right mid and lower zones. Differential
 diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate or changes related to aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 2) ? new area of cavitation within the right base infiltrate.
