                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent bronchoscopy with gastropulmonary fistula and persistent
 cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  Patient is
 status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through, with relatively unchanged
 contour of the mediastinum.  There is worsening consolidative opacity within
 the right lung base and right mid lung field, compatible with worsening
 infection.  Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A trace right pleural effusion is
 likely present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening airspace opacities within the right lung base and right
 mid lung field likely reflecting worsening infection, possibly aspiration
 pneumonia.
