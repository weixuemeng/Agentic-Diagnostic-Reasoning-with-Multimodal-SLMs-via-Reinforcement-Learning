                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with subjective fevers  // ___ ___ PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___. Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of consolidation, effusion or pulmonary
 edema. Known pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not clearly delineated.
 There is however a nodular opacity on the lateral view projecting over the
 major fissure compatible with nodule seen on prior exam, potentially with
 interval growth. Multiple healed right lateral rib fractures are again seen.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation without acute cardiopulmonary process. On the lateral view
 there is suggestion of a pulmonary nodule along the major fissure which may
 have grown since prior CT.  Other pulmonary nodules better seen on prior CT.
