                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pressure and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  On the lateral view, there is a 2.2 cm
 rounded opacity projecting over the lower lobes and descending thoracic aorta,
 not clearly delineated on the frontal view.  The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Mild scarring is noted within the
 lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Approximately 2.2 cm rounded opacity projecting over the lower lobes on the
 lateral view in the region of the descending thoracic aorta.  This could
 reflect a summation of shadows as no corresponding abnormality is definitively
 noted on the frontal view, but a non urgent chest CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise seen.
