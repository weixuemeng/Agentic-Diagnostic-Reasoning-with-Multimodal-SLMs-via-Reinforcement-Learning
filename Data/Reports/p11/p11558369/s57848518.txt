                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left empyema s/p left VATS total
 decortication  // assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR on ___, the lungs are better aerated.  The small to
 moderate left effusion appears better, but this may be partially due to erect
 positioning.  There is still significant retrocardiac atelectasis. No new
 areas of consolidation. Right lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax. 
 Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in left effusion, though this may be partially due
 to positioning.
