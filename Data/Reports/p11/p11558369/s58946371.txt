                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left empyema s/p left VATS total
 decortication  // assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been no improvement in the large left posterior pleural fluid
 loculation since ___.  Left pleural thickening or fluid along the
 diaphragmatic and lateral costal pleural surfaces is relatively small and has
 probably decreased in the antrum. .  Clinical evaluation is necessary
 regarding the possibility of chronic empyema, although I would expect more
 rather than less ancillary pleural fluid to have accumulated if that were the
 case.
 
 Right lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.
