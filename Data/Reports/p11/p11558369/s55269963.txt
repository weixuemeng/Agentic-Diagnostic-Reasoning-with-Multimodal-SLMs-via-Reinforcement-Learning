                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia  // f/u
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in severity
 and extent of the known left parenchymal opacities, combines to areas of
 lateral pleural thickening. The position of the left chest tube is constant
 and unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is likely caused by a
 combination of pleural effusion and pleural thickening. The right lung is
 unremarkable. Moderate cardiomegaly.
