                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with congestive heart failure with ejection fraction
 of 25%, now with dyspnea, hypotension, presyncopal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Bilateral shoulder
 prostheses are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
