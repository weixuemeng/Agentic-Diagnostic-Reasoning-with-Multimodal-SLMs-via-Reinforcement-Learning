                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Vomiting, abdominal pain, assess for aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 AP upright and lateral radiographs are obtained of the chest.  The lateral
 radiograph is limited as the patient is unable to lift his arm. Lungs are low
 in volume with possible left pleural effusion.  Left basal opacity is likely
 atelectasis, though aspiration or pneumonia is an alternative consideration. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is also present.  Cardiac size is top normal.
