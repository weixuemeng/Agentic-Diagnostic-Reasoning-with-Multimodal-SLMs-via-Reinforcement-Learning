 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 There is a small nodular opacification just below the anterior aspect of the
 first rib on the left.  This probably represents a calcified granuloma. 
 However, if there is any clinical concern for pulmonary nodules, CT would be
 the next imaging procedure.
