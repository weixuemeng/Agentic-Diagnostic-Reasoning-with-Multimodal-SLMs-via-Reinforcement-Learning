                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation, altered mental status, unresponsive
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and
 off the inferior borders of the film.  Heart size appears at least mild to
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities in lung bases my reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however
 the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Punctate calcific
 densities in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may reflect gallstones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes are in standard positions.
 2. Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
