                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___-year-old female initially presenting with increased work of breath,
 respiratory distress, with a history of IV drug abuse. Linear markings seen on
 the prior chest radiograph likely overlying hair, but pneumomediastinum was a
 possibility; repeat chest radiograph to exclude pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Linear markings seen previously are
 no longer visualized, and likely represented overlying hair or fabric rather
 than pneumomediastinum.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise normal chest radiograph, without
 evidence of pneumomediastinum.
