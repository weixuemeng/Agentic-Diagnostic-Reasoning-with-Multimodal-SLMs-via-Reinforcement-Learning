  Lung volumes are low.  There has been interval development of moderate
  pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with a combination
  of pleural effusion and collapse.  Small right pleural effusion is also noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis s/p TIPs with SOB, wheezing.  //
 pna vs. pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is now
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and moderately severe pulmonary
 edema.  Pre-existing left pleural effusion is now moderate in size and a small
 right pleural effusion is new.  Curvilinear interface in periphery of left mid
 a and lower hemi thorax may be due to skin fold but attention in this region
 on short-term followup radiographs would be helpful to exclude an atypical
 manifestation of a hydro pneumothorax in this region.
