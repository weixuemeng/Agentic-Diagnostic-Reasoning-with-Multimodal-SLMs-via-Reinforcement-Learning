                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with large varus seal bleeding
 status post Lake more tube and emergent TIPS placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the
 carina. An introducer catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava. An
 endoscope passes through the whole esophagus and imaged upper part of the
 stomach. No inflated balloon is visualized. The lung volumes are low. The
 heart shows a left ventricular configuration, as before. There is new
 retrocardiac opacification which is very commonly due to atelectasis.
 Coinciding small pleural effusion is not excluded on the left.  None is
 demonstrated on the right side. Perihilar opacity suggests mild fluid
 overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endoscope traversing the stomach and visualized upper part of the stomach; no
 inflated balloon visualized. Findings suggests mild vascular congestion and
 increasing left basilar opacification, probably due to atelectasis.
 Endotracheal tube seated slightly lower than before; it may be appropriate to
 retract it slightly.
