                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year woman with PMHx of CVA c/b aphasia, dementia (AOx1 at
 baseline), dysphagia s/p gastrostomy tube, transferred from SNF with increased
 work of breathing.  // Assess for interval changes. Failed SBT ___ secretions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to marked patient rotation.  The
 endotracheal tube tip is 2 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  There is persistent left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The heart remains enlarged.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 similar in appearance when compared to the prior study.  Airspace opacity at
 the right lung base may reflect either atelectasis or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis versus consolidation.  Otherwise no significant interval
 change when compared to the prior study.
