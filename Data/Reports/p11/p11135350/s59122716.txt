                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with reported pneumonia from nursing home.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 The right lung is clear.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 which is clearly seen on prior and could be due to underlying left basilar
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Increased opacity over the spine on the lateral
 view is likely in part due to degenerative, the tortuous descending thoracic
 aorta and hilar vasculature, although superimposed component of overlying
 consolidation is also possible in this region.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted at the aortic arch.  There is a sliver of lucency projecting over
 the upper abdomen to the left of midline.  This is of could be due to
 pneumomediastinum or potentially free intraperitoneal air.  Consider repeat
 examination with a chest x-ray with PA technique if possible.  Otherwise, CT
 scan may be necessary.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5:35 p.m. on ___ by Dr.
 ___ ___ the phone 2 minutes after time of discovery.
