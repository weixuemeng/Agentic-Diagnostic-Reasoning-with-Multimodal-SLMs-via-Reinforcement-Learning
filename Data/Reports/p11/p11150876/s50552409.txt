                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post single-chamber pacemaker placement, rule
 out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of a single-lead left-sided pacemaker with lead
 extending to the expected position of the right ventricle without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Linear left base opacities likely represent
 atelectasis/scarring.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains calcified and
 tortuous.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Median sternotomy wires are again seen along with
 mediastinal surgical clips.  Sclerosis of a lower thoracic vertebral body
 remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post placement of a single-lead left-sided pacemaker with
 lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Left basilar atelectasis/scarring.
