                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob, hx chf, pacemaker  // r/o chf, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided demonstrate midline sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips.  Left chest wall pacer device is unchanged with lead
 extending into the region of the right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged with stable mediastinal contour and aortic calcifications noted. 
 Lungs are clear.  Increased lucency in the upper lungs is consistent with
 emphysema.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Severe compression deformity of an upper thoracic vertebral body and
 vertebroplasty of a mid thoracic vertebral body are overall similar to the
 prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly unchanged.  No acute intrathoracic process.
