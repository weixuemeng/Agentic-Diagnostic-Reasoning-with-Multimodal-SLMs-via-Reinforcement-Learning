 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the upper lungs has improved.  There is less
 edema in the left lower lung, although moderate left basal atelectasis
 persists.  I suspect the upper lobe abnormality was asymmetric edema.  Small
 to moderate left pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly are stable.  No
 pneumothorax.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement.
