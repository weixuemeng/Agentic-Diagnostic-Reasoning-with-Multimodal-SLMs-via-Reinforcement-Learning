                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  SOB  // evaluate for CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A cardiac conduction device is contiguous
 with a single lead, which appears to terminate in the right ventricle,
 unchanged.  Asymmetrical opacity at the junction of the left first anterior
 rib and medial clavicle is not fully localizer characterized on this portable
 radiograph.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for patchy bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 Focal asymmetrical opacity in left apex, for which further evaluation with
 standard PA and lateral chest radiographs is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Recommend a PA and lateral chest radiograph nonurgently
 to assess left apical opacity.
