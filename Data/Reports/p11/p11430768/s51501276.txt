                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with aphagia.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution performed approximately
 four hours prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding.
 There is an ill-defined opacity in the left cardiophrenic angle, which appears
 to obscure the left inferior cardiac margin, new compared with exam performed
 four hours ago.  No other focal opacities are identified.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New focal opacity in the left lower lobe may represent a focus of
 atelectasis or aspiration given short interval of development.
