                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bronchioalveolar carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma status
 post splenectomy, presenting with fever and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  Suture
 material is again visualized in the right upper lung, compatible with history
 of partial right upper lobectomy.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable calcified lymph nodes are visualized
 in the anterior mediastinum on lateral projection; however, there are some
 new, more central nodular opacities which were not present on prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia, but with new nodular opacities on
 lateral projection only, centrally located which may represent recurrent
 lymphadenopathy and/or lung nodules.  Correspondence with Dr. ___
 indicates recent cross sectional imaging was performed at ___
 ___ to which comparison should be made.  If outside study is not
 available, further evaluation with dedicated chest CT is recommended.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
 at 1:25 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review.  If prior
 outside study becomes available for comparison, an addendum will be issued to
 this report.
