                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Multiple
 nodules are again seen within the anterior and middle mediastinum, not
 significantly changed from the prior exam, and some of which reflect calcified
 lymph nodes.  Several chain sutures are noted projecting within the right
 upper lung field.  There is associated volume loss in the right lung with
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged nodular opacities within the anterior and middle mediastinum, some
 of which reflect calcified lymph nodes.  Correlation with prior
 cross-sectional imaging is recommended.  Postsurgical changes in the right
 upper lung field.  No new areas of focal consolidation present.
