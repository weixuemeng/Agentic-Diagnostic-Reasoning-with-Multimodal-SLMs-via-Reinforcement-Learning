                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with doe and hypoxia, history of interstitial lung
 disease // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar and lower lobe
 opacities may relate to patient's chronic lung disease however, superimposed
 infection are mild edema is not excluded.  More focal right mid lung opacity
 is seen, new since the prior chest radiograph, and infectious process could be
 present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and chronic lung disease.  More focal patchy opacity in the
 right mid lung new since the prior chest radiograph, could represent a site of
 infection.
