                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Prostate cancer, fever, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bibasilar vague opacities.  The lung volumes are low and
 there is significant overlying soft tissue which limits evaluation.  There is
 likely pulmonary vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly.  Pneumonia at the
 lung bases cannot be entirely ruled out.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 a possible small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar vague opacities may represent atelectasis given low
 lung volumes; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
