  Bibasilar linear opacities are most consistent with atelectasis but infection
  cannot be entirely excluded.  Stable mild cardiomegaly and interval
  improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Urosepsis, questionable consolidation on portable chest x-ray,
 evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  As a result, the pre-existing opacities, that were likely
 atelectatic in origin, have almost completely resolved.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
