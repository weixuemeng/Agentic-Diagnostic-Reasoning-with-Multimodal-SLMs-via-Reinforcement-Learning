                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SCC of the cheek  // rule out pneumothorax
 after neck dissection and Pec Flap (R)      rule out pneumothorax after neck
 dissection and Pec Flap (R)
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 20:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  A tracheostomy tube appears to be in place, although it is
 difficult to determine the location of the tip due to the projection of
 imaging.  This will likely be better assessed on followup imaging.  Multiple
 surgical clips are seen overlying the right upper chest and right hilum.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There may be small layering effusions.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient
 positioning between studies.
