                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cholangitis, now with fever and abdominal pain, here
 to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright radiographs and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse mild interstitial opacities are slightly increased from the
 most recent prior study of ___.  Increased opacification of the right lung
 base is noted.  The lung volumes remain low.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The aortic knob remains densely calcified.  A prosthetic aortic
 valve is again noted and unchanged in position.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy with wires appearing intact.  Dense mitral annular
 calcifications are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial abnormality could represent edema or
 fibrosis.  Possible superimposed consolidation in the right lung base.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
