 confluent opacity which may reflect developing infection.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 aortic knob remains densely calcified.  A prosthetic aortic valve is in
 expected unchanged position.  Dense mitral annular calcifications are noted. 
 Median sternotomy wires appear intact.

 consolidation in the left mid lung.  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph to
 assess for progression.
