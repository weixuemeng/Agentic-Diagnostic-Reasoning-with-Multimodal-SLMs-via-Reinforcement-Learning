                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with known pleural effusions with new O2 requirement.  //
 worsening pleural effusions?  traumatic injuries?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Overlying EKG leads are present.  The
 heart remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded. 
 There is opacity in the lower lungs which is concerning for aspiration versus
 pneumonia.  Partially layering pleural effusions difficult to exclude in the
 correct clinical setting.  There is prominence of the pulmonary hila which may
 indicate a component of central pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear intact.  Calcification adjacent to the
 left humeral head is again noted compatible with calcific tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly with lower lung opacities concerning for pneumonia/
 aspiration, versus layering pleural effusions.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.
