 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS, ARF  // acute interval change, volume
 overload      acute interval change, volume overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There may be
 slight increase in the pulmonary edema.  The left hemidiaphragm is more
 sharply seen, suggesting that previous changes may have reflected merely
 atelectasis.
