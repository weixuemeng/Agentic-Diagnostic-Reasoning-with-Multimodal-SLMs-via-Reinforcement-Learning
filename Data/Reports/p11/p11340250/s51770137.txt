 cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 3 cm
 above the carina.  Lung volumes are diminished with patchy bibasilar opacities
 favoring atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pulmonary edema.
