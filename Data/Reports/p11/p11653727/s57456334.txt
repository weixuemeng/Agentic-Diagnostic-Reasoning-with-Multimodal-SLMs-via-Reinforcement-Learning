                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.  Rule out fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs with severe
 emphysematous changes in the upper lobes, unchanged from the prior
 examination.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No displaced fracture identified.  However this is not a sensitive test for
 subtle nondisplaced rib fractures.  If there is continued clinical concern, a
 dedicated rib series with a skin marker at the location of the patient's pain
 is recommended.  
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Emphysema.
