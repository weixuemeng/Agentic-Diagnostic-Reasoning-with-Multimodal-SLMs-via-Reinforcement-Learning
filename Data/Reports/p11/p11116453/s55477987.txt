                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intermittent chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size remains moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration. Curvilinear calcification along the left lateral margin of the
 heart is unchanged, and again may reflect the sequela of prior infarction or
 possibly an aneurysm as suggested previously. The aorta remains tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
