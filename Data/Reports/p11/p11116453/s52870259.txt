                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, CP  // evidence of fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Given differences in positioning and technique, there has been no significant
 interval change. The lungs are essentially clear aside from linear left
 basilar opacity which is likely atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable. Linear calcification again projects over the lateral aspect of cardiac
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process, no significant interval change.
