                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiac enlargement with a left ventricular configuration
 appears unchanged.  A curvilinear density suggesting a calcification along the
 left lateral margin of the heart is also unchanged.  Possibly this reflects
 prior infarction or even an aneurysm as mentioned previously although there is
 no bulging contour or significant radiographic change.  The aorta is again
 mildly tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Osteophytes
 along the lower thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
