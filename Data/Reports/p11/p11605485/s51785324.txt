 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  In the left base, there is a small
 ill-defined opacity that could represent atelectasis or small area of
 pneumonia, otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is pectus excavatum.
