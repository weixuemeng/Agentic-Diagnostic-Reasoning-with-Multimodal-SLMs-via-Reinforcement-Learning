 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with AFib for one week, now with shortness of
 breath.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  A new opacity
 identified at the left lung base laterally and posteriorly, potentially due to
 atelectasis versus scarring.  Elsewhere, the left lung and the right lung are
 clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis versus scarring, but no other acute
 cardiopulmonary process or evidence of failure.
