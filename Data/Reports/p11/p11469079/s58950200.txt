                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with treated small cell lung cancer  // post
 ___ 1.0L right
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 15:32.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had right thoracentesis with interval decrease in the known
 right pleural effusion, which is now trace in size. However, there is a new
 tiny right apical pneumothorax.  The lungs remain hyperinflated but clear,
 which is most commonly due to emphysema. The heart and mediastinum are within
 normal limits.  A mid thoracic vertebral body compression fracture is
 unchanged. There is a stable small left pleural effusion. Mild dilatation of
 upper lobe vessels may be an early indication of impending heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right thoracentesis with interval decrease in right pleural
 effusion, which is now trace in size.
