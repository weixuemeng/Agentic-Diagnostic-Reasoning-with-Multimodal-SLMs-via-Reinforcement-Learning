                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ; ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 A moderately sized loculated right pleural effusion appears unchanged. A small
 left pleural effusion appears larger and may have a subpulmonic component.
 Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy appears unchanged. Geographic marginated
 opacities in the right upper lobe, likely represent post radiation changes.
 Multilevel mid thoracic vertebral body compression fractures appears
 unchanged.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  A moderate to large loculated pleural effusion on the right appears
 unchanged. The small, left pleural effusion appears mildly increased in size
 and could potentially have a more substantial subpulmonic component based tiny
 increased distance from apparent diaphragm level to location of gastric
 bubble. If warranted clinically, left lateral decubitus radiograph may be
 helpful to better quantify the size of the left a fusion.
 
 2.  Multilevel mid thoracic vertebral body compression fractures appear
 unchanged.
 
 3. Geographic marginated opacities in the right upper lobe likely represent
 postradiation changes and appear stable.
 
 4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy appears unchanged.
