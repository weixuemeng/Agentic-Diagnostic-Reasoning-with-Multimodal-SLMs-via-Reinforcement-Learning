                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of sarcoidosis,
 presenting with productive cough.  Evaluate for infection, new acute
 abnormalities?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is noted.  Unchanged appearance of thoracic aorta
 without evidence of local contour abnormalities.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Again seen are bilateral extensive fibrotic changes in the upper
 lung zones coinciding with elevation of the hilar structures.  These changes
 have not undergone any alteration during the latest three-year examination
 interval.  Comparison is extended to an older chest examination of ___ and again there is no evidence of any interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable upper lobe changes of mostly interstitial nature including
 hilar elevation compatible with the clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  The
 present examination excludes new acute pulmonary abnormalities.
