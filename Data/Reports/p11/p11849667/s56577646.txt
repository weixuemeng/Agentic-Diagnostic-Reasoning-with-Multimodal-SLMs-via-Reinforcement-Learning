 Mild left basilar atelectasis/scarring is seen.  No focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Stable lateral right upper lung
 scarring is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
