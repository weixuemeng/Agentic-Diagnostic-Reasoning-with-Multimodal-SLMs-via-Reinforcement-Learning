 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate moderate
 cardiomegaly with prominence of the central bronchovascular structures likely
 due to low lung volumes.  Prior radiographs demonstratee left lower lobe anf
 lingular bronchiectasis. Today's examination demonstrates relative increased
 opacification in these regions concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Increased opacification in areas
 of known bronchiectasis in left lower lobe and lingula concerning for
 pneumonia. Recommend further evaluation with conventional radiographs.
