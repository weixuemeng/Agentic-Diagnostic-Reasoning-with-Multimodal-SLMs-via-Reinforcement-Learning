                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with placement of right internal jugular central
 venous catheter
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph from outside hospital
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip located in the proximal right atrium.  No pneumothorax. 
 Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures and
 persistent widening of the superior mediastinal contour.  Heart size is
 exaggerated as result of low lung volumes, appearing mild to moderately
 enlarged.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the proximal right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
