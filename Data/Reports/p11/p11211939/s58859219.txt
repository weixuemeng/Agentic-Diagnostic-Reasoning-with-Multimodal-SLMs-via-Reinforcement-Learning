                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted, with diffuse calcification and
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unchanged.  There is minimal prominence of the pulmonary vascular
 markings, suggestive of mild congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 Subtle patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular
 prominence, but no overt pulmonary edema.
