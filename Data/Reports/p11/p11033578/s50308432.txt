                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in patient status post left
 thoracotomy and pneumonectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left thoracotomy and pneumonectomy.  PA
 and lateral radiographs demonstrate continued and expected leftward shift of
 the mediastinum and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a slight increase
 in the amount of pleural fluid.  There is persistent air within the pleural
 space as well.  A large amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left
 hemithorax extending into the neck is also unchanged.  The right lung remains
 clear and there is no right-sided pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected post-operative progressive changes following left
 pneumonectomy.
