                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left pneumonectomy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The progressive fibrothorax in the left hemithorax leads to ongoing
 volume loss on the left, as reflected by diaphragmatic elevation and
 mediastinal shift to the left.  Post-operative rib defects on the left are
 unchanged.  In the right lung, aside of overinflation, there is no sign of
 pathologic changes.
