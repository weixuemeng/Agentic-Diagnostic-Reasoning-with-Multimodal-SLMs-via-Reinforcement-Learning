                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and recent left pneumonectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post left pneumonectomy
 with air-fluid level noted in the pneumonectomy cavity.  The amount of fluid
 in the pleural space has increased since the prior study, an expected finding.
 There is unchanged leftward shift of mediastinal structures due to volume
 loss.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall and extending into the
 left neck appears relatively unchanged.  The right lung is clear.  No
 right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left-sided rib deformities are compatible with
 prior thoracotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax from prior
 pneumonectomy with continued subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. 
 Right lung is clear.
