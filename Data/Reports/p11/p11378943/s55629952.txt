                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a cough for three months.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has increased, but there is no pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion.  Appearance of the right aortic arch is unchanged from the
 previous examination, but on both studies, there is suggestion of a moderate
 degree of impingement on the trachea from behind.  I would recommend CT
 scanning to exclude a concurrent endotracheal nodule.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned.
