                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough, congestion, low-grade fever, history of
 asthma, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no consolidation.  Cardiac contour is normal. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right thyroid nodule, already
 investigated by ultrasound, measuring 1.4 cm, is probably too small to explain
 the tracheal deviation to the left.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There are no acute cardiopulmonary findings.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia.
