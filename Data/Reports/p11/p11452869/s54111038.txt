                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 20:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post transapical aortic valve
 replacement, assess for effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:05.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 20:14 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There has been prior median sternotomy with several
 stable broken sternal wires and stable appearance to the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours in this patient status post recent valve replacement. 
 There is stable left pleural effusion with some improved aeration at the left
 base, although there is persistent opacity, likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. 
 There has been interval appearance of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. 
 Streaky linear opacities at the right base likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
