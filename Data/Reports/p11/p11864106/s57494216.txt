                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube pull, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:18 a.m., the left-sided chest tube has been
 removed.  There is a tiny left pneumothorax, smaller than on the prior film. 
 Some subcutaneous emphysema is noted, now seen over the left neck.  Again seen
 is patchy opacity at the left base, with an elevated left hemidiaphragm, and
 clips in the left hilar area, overall unchanged.  Additional opacity or
 atelectasis/scarring is seen in the left lung medially.  Overall appearance is
 consistent with left-sided volume loss.  The right lung is probably very
 slightly hyperinflated, in compensation.  On the right, no CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of left chest tube.  Tiny left-sided
 pneumothorax present, decreased compared with ___. Otherwise, no
 significant interval change.
