                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left exploratory thoracoscopy, left thoracotomy, and
 left lower lobectomy, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is expected left mediastinal shift with interval resolution of
 pneumothorax and no appreciable pleural effusion demonstrated, although small
 amount cannot be excluded.  Loculated air in the anterior aspect of the pleura
 is noted.  The left lower lobe opacity is seen, still representing
 post-surgical changes and should be further followed.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
