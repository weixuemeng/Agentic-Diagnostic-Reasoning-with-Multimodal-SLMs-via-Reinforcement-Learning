                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with non-small cell lung cancer,
 status post resection, assess for abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The previously identified remaining tiny
 left-sided apical pneumothorax cannot be identified anymore.  The pleural
 densities on the left base, however, remain with obliteration of the
 diaphragmatic contours and hazy densities related to the remaining pleural
 effusion that mostly occupies the posterior pleural sinus on the left side. 
 The next previous examination detectable small air-fluid level related to the
 remaining postoperative pneumothorax is not seen anymore.  The basal pleural
 densities along the diaphragm may have increased slightly, but no new
 parenchymal abnormalities are present.  The right-sided hemithorax remains
 unchanged and within normal limits as before.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved appearance of previously remaining small postoperative
 pneumothorax.  Significant pleural densities on the left base remain in this
 patient status post left lower lobectomy.  Further followup is recommended.
