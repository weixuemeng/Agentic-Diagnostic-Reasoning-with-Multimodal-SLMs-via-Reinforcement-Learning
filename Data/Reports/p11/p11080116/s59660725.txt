                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right middle
 lobectomy and right basal segmentectomy due to metastatic colon cancer.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The appearance of the right lung base is stable since the prior study
 consistent with prior surgery with interval resolution of subcutaneous air. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There are no new consolidations
 demonstrated.  Right lower lobe linear opacities appear unchanged
 corresponding to previously demonstrated areas of surgery with adjacent
 scarring/atelectasis.  No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  The right
 mediastinal shift is expected.
