                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracotomy and middle lobectomy and right basilar
 segmentectomy for lung nodules relating to colon cancer, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change in the degree of pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas persists. 
 Dense streaks of atelectasis are again seen at the left base.  The right chest
 tube appears to have been withdrawn.
