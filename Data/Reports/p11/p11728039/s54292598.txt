                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible aspiration pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there are low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette in a patient with previous CABG procedure.  No definite vascular
 congestion.  Opacification at the right base is again consistent with pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Less prominent blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is seen, though the previously noted streak of atelectasis at the left
 base is no longer present.
