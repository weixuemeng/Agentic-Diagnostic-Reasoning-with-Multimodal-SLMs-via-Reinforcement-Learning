                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // evidence of pneumonia      evidence
 of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal/pelvic CT from ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Loculated density at the right lung base is consistent with known pleural
 lipoma. Consolidation at the right lung base appears worse as compared to
 prior chest radiographs, could relate to worsening atelectasis and small
 pleural effusion, however an overlying infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The heart is enlarged. 
 Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, tip probably projects over the
 stomach, however difficult to visualize on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation at the right lung base appears worse as compared to prior chest
 radiographs, could relate to worsening atelectasis and small pleural effusion,
 however an overlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical
 correlation recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 7:06 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of
