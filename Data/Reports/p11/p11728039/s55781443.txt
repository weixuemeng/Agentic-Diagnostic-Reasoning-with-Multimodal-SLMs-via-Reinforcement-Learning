                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with elevated white blood count, small-bowel
 obstruction and effusion on CT, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___ and CTA ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lower lobe opacity has
 increased from ___, stable from earlier the same day, consistent with a
 combination of moderate right pleural effusion, a fat-containing lesion in the
 right lower lateral hemithorax and increasing opacities in the right middle
 lobe and right lower lobe.  The ill-defined opacities in the right middle lobe
 and right lower lobe are likely due to aspiration.  NG tube tip is out of view
 below the diaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax or left effusion.
 
 The fat-containing lesion in the right hemithorax is better seen in prior CT.
