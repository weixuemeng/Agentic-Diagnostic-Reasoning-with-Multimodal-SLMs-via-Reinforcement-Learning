  Moderate size left and small right bilateral pleural effusions, similar
  compared to the previous study. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
  compressive atelectasis though infection and aspiration cannot be completely
  excluded. Gaseous dilatation of a small bowel loop on the lateral view.
  Consider abdominal radiographs for further assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity swelling
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate left and small right bilateral pleural effusions are re-
 demonstrated, similar in extent compared to the previous exam. The cardiac
 silhouette size is difficult to assess given obscuration from the adjacent
 pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Degenerative changes
 are noted within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  On the lateral view, there
 is focally dilated small bowel loop measuring up to 3.8 cm.
