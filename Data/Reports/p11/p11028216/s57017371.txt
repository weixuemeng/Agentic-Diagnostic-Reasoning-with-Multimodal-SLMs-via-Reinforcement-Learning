                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia on exertion.  Known systolic
 congestive heart failure, vomiting this morning, evaluate for vascular
 congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show interposition of air-filled
 hepatic flexure between the liver and the elevated right hemidiaphragm
 compared to a prior study from just six days ago.  Associated subsegmental
 atelectasis limits visualization of known irregularity/consolidation that was
 seen on CT on the ___, but a 6 mm nodular density is evident at the right
 lung base also be seen on CT.  Attention to pulmonary vascularity shows this
 to be within normal limits and the lungs are free of edema or pleural fluid. 
 The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged and no new bony lesion is
 seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Internal interposition of air-filled hepatic flexure between
 right hemidiaphragm (which is elevated) and liver.  Further compressing
 parenchyma at the right base, possibly giving rise to the patient's current
 symptoms.
