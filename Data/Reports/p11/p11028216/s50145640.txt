                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 again noted.  Previously noted ill-defined opacities within both lung bases
 have improved from the prior exam, with only minimal residual patchy opacity
 seen.  No pleural effusions are identified, and there is no pneumothorax. 
 Minimal scarring is noted within the right lung apex.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near complete interval resolution of previously seen multifocal pneumonia with
 only minimal residual patchy bibasilar opacities.  Previously noted right
 pleural effusion has also appeared resolved.
