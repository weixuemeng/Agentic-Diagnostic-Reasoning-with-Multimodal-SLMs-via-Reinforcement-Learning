                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB  // Please eval for edema, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in the
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___, ___ and ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval improvement of the previously seen bilateral pleural
 effusions. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle and retrocardiac opacity
 suggests a left pleural effusion, and no significant right pleural effusion is
 noted.  There is continued collapse and/or consolidation at the left base,
 improved compare with the ___ radiograph.  Bilateral pleural catheters are
 again noted, 1 and each lung base. The cardiac mediastinal silhouette is
 normal, allowing for slight unfolding of the aorta. There is borderline upper
 zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Left-sided pacemaker type device is
 again noted, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, slightly
 improved on the left can considerably improved on the right,  compared with ___. No overt CHF. No pneumothorax detected .
