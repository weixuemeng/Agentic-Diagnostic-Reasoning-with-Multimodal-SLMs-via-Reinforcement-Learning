 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, AF, HTN, T2DM, and pulmonary HTN that
 presents with bilateral pleural effusions.  // Whether bilateral pleural
 effusions are worsneing?     Whether bilateral pleural effusions are
 worsneing?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 07:28

 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 07:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A dual lead left-sided pacer remains in place with its leads terminating over
 the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.
 Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be
 bibasilar opacity which is likely not significantly changed and more likely
 represents partial lower lobe atelectasis given the presence of stable small
 pleural effusions, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
