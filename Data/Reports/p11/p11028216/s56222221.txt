                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx ? pneumonia  // ? resolution
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of
 the known left lower lobe parenchymal opacity, formally attributed to either
 pneumonia or aspiration.  The accompanying pleural effusion on the left is
 also unchanged. However, similar changes, over 0 less severe, are seen at the
 right lung base.  The bilaterally and the location as well as the time course
 of changes favors aspiration over pneumonia.
 Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
