                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD, status post right upper
 lobectomy performed in ___ for lung cancer.  Recently increased exertional
 dyspnea, assess for interval change.
 
 Significant cardiac enlargement is present as before.  The configuration
 suggests prominence of left ventricle and mild prominence of left atrium as
 well.  Again observed is a relative prominence of the pulmonary artery contour
 on the frontal view, coinciding with prominence of the hilar vascular
 structures, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.  The pulmonary vasculature
 shows an upper zone redistribution pattern.  There is evidence of restricted
 vasculature on the bases.  In the right hemithorax, the patient is status post
 right upper lobectomy with thereto related skeletal changes and basal scar
 formation in the pleural space.
 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, the cardiac enlargement is rather stable.  The pulmonary congestive
 pattern which already earlier was indicative of mild-to-moderate degree of
 chronic CHF has now increased and one also observes more pleural density in
 the right base and beginning pleural blunting of the left lateral sinus as
 well.  New discrete pulmonary infiltrates cannot be identified.
 
 No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly unchanged.  No evidence of vertebral body
 compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly as before.  Comparison suggests some increase in
 pulmonary congestion and now bilateral small amounts of pleural effusion in
 this patient with evidence of chronic CHF.  Followup chest examination with
 shorter examination interval all may be helpful to monitor appropriate
 dehydration therapy.
