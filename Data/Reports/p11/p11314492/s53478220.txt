                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p left thoracentesis  // r/o PTX      r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 20:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 18:06 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is persistent moderate but slightly smaller left effusion with no
 evidence of pneumothorax status post thoracentesis.  Stable small right
 pleural effusion.  There is slight improved aeration in the retrocardiac
 region likely secondary to decreasing atelectasis in the left lower lobe lobe.
 Scattered nodular opacities in both lungs concerning for metastatic static
 disease are better appreciated on the CT dated ___.  Increasing
 interstitial abnormality suggests interval appearance of superimposed edema. 
 Patchy opacity at the right base has improved suggestive of resolving
 atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences
 in patient rotation.
