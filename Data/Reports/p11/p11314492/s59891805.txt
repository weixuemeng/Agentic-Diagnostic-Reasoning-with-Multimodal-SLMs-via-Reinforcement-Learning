 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD' h/o RUL resection for lung cancer;
 recent dx of breast cancer  // evaulate for worsening DOE and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Globular right hilar appearance is unchanged,
 pleural effusion is minimal, versus pleural thickening. Postsurgical changes
 in the right thorax are similar. No interstitial lung disease a pulmonary
 edema appreciated. New nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung might
 represent atelectasis but giving patient history pulmonary nodule is a
 possibility and further assessment with chest CT it would be justified.
