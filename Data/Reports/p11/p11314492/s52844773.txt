                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with a fib, dCHF, metaststic cancer w/pleural
 effusion p/w dyspnea.  // pt with hx of COPD, dCHF, and probable malignant
 pleural effusion p/w dyspnea. Any acute intrathoracic process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been considerable increase in opacity over the left hemi thorax,
 likely due to significant interval increase in left pleural effusion,
 underlying consolidation or disease progression not excluded.  Small right
 pleural effusion persists.  New pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT from ___ were better assessed on CT.  Slight increase in opacity at the
 right lung base is nonspecific and could be due to disease progression,
 infection, aspiration.  The left aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well
 assessed due to the large left hemi thorax opacity, although grossly, likely
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval significant increase in left hemi thorax opacity likely large left
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation not
 excluded.  Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules better assessed on prior CT.
