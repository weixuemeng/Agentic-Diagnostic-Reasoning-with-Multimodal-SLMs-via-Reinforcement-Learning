                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer, pleural
 effusion, ? of retrocardiac opacity on admission, here with ongoing moderate
 leukocytosis and intermittent dyspnea.  Also with hx. of HFPEF.  Please eval
 for: worsening effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, other?  // ___ year old

 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 21:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 20:05 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given differences in technique and positioning between studies, the moderate
 left effusion and retrocardiac consolidation are likely stable.  Smaller right
 effusion.  Scattered nodular opacities in both lungs concerning for metastatic
 disease are better appreciated on the CT dated ___.  Improved
 appearance of the interstitium suggests resolved superimposed edema.  There is
 now a patchy opacity at the right base which could reflect an early pneumonia
 or aspiration, although atelectasis could also have this appearance.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.
