  moderate anterior wedge compression of a vertebral body, approx level of L1,
  new since ___, otherwise indeterminate age. right base opacity, may be
  pleural effusion+atelectasis, with possible underlying consolidation. given
  repeated history of right base opacity and no chest CT in our system, consider
  non-urgent chest CT to exclude underlying lesion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Single-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  Again seen is a right pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is
 mild left base atelectasis.  There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature.  The cardiac silhouette size cannot be accurately assessed due to
 the right base opacity.  The aortic knob appears calcified.  Moderate anterior
 wedge compression of a vertebral body, approx level of L1, new since ___,
 otherwise indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity likely due to a combination of pleural
 effusion and underlying atelectasis with possible underlying consolidation. 
 Due to persistent right base opacification without evidence of prior chest CT
 performed here, nonurgent chest CT should be considered to assess for
 underlying lesion.
 
 Moderate anterior wedge compression of a vertebral body, approx level of L1,
 new since ___, otherwise indeterminate age.
