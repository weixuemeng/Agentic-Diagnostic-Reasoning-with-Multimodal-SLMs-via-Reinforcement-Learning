 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have further increased.  There is minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sinuses, suggesting minimal pleural effusions.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.  The lung volumes continue to be low.  Known healed rib
 fractures.  No pneumonia.
