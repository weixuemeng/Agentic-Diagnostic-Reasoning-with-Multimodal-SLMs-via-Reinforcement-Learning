                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, chills  // Any pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technique, no definite infiltrate is identified.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is increase in the degree of upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora, suggesting mild fluid overload.
 
 Otherwise, no significant change is detected. No definite interstitial edema
 and no alveolar edema is seen. No effusions. Probable atelectasis in the lower
 lobe posteriorly, ? on the right, but this does not appear substantially
 changed.
 
 Again noted is hyperinflation consistent with COPD and moderately severe
 cardiomegaly.  Including prominence of the contour of the main pulmonary
 artery.
 
 Known vertebral body compression deformities 0 less well visualized on the
 current film due to technical differences.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora compared with ___, consistent with mild fluid overload/early CHF. Probable right
 lower lobe atelectasis, unchanged. No new infiltrate identified.
