                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy linear opacities in the
 left mid-to-lower lung suggest minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 New sclerosis associated with the right posterior sixth rib suggests a
 fracture that is subacute or older without displacement.  Mild compression
 deformities along the visualized thoracolumbar spine appear unchanged.  The
 bones are probably demineralized.  
  
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
