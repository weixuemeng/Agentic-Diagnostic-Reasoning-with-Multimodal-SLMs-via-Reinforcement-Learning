                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the already increased size
 of the cardiac silhouette has further increased.  There are indirect signs for
 global cardiac enlargement, in particular enlargement of the left atrium.  The
 diameter of the pulmonary vessels has increased, so that the radiograph now
 reflects mild pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pleural effusions.  Known
 healed left rib fractures.  No pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
