                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is partly calcified
 and mildly unfolded.  Patchy opacity projecting over the lingular area
 suggests minor residual scarring or atelectasis, but decreased.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild losses among mid and lower thoracic
 vertebral body heights appear unchanged.  A contour abnormality of the left
 posterolateral fifth rib appears old and unchanged suggesting a prior
 fracture.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute injury.
