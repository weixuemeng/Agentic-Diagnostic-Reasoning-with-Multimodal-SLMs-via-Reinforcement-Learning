                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are at the patient's approximately baseline.  There is slight indistinctness
 of the hila bilaterally, and some cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature,
 consistent with mild interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or focal consolidation.  There is a probable fat pad adjacent to the
 cardiac apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight indistinctness of the hila bilaterally with cephalization of
 pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild interstitial edema.  
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
