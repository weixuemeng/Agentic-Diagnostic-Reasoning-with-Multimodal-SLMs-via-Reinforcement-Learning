                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, sepsis s/p CVL placement.  //
 Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 2 cm above the level the carina.  A nasoenteric tube is in-situ,
 the tip is not visualized lies below the left hemidiaphragm.  A tunneled right
 internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium.  A right
 internal jugular vascular access catheter terminates in the SVC.  There are
 persistent bilateral opacities predominately perihilar distribution consistent
 pulmonary edema.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature persists.  Unchanged
 left lower lobe atelectasis.  An apparent opacity in the left upper lobe is
 also unchanged compared to the prior study but new compared earlier studies. 
 This is not clearly seen to be on the patient's skin and would be better
 evaluated with a CT of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearances of pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.
 
 An apparent more confluent masslike opacity is seen in the left upper lobe,
 attention on follow-up studies recommended.  Alternatively this may be further
 evaluated with a CT chest.
