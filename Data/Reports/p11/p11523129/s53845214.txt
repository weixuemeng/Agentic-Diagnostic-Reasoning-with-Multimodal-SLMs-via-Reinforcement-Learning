 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Type II diabetes mellitus, known diastolic chronic heart failure,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No overt pulmonary edema but signs of mild fluid overload are still
 present.  Trace right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
