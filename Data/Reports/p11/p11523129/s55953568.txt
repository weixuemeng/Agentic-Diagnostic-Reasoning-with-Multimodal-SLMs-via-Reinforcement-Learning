                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, hypoxia, tachypnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contour is similar.  A moderate layering left pleural effusion
 likely accounts for the left perihilar haziness.  Dense retrocardiac
 opacification could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Right lung is grossly clear without right-sided pleural effusion. 
 No definite pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Multiple clips project over the epigastric region.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate layering left pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 compressive atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
