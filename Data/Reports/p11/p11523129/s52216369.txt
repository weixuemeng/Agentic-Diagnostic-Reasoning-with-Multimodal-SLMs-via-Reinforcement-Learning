 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The NG and ET tubes have been removed.  There is marked interval increase in
 size of the left-sided pleural effusion.  Difficult to comment on the interval
 change of the left lung airspace consolidation, as the vague airspace
 opacification projecting over the left upper and mid lung zones may be
 secondary to pleural fluid or airspace consolidation. Mild mediastinal shift
 to the right. The major airways are patent.  No pneumothorax.  Small to
 moderate right-sided effusion unchanged.  The right upper lung zone is clear. 
 Evidence of previous cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked interval increase in size of the left-sided pleural effusion.
