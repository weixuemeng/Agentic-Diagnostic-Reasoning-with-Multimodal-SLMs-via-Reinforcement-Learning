                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia, brief episode of altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and low lung volumes.  The
 cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess.  Large hiatal hernia is again
 noted.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Chronic atelectasis of the right lower lobe is re-
 demonstrated.  Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 clearly evident.  Multiple clips are noted within the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Large hiatal hernia.
