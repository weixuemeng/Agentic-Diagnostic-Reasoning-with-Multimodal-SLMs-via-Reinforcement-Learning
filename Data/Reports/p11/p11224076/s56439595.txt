                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 again demonstrate a large hiatal hernia projecting to the left lower chest. 
 The right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated.  Between the right
 hemidiaphragmatic elevation and the left-sided hiatal hernia, the lungs
 demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Clips in the right upper quadrant are compatible with prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia and bibasilar atelectasis, although
 underlying pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
