                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary edema after
 diuresis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable.  Bibasal opacities are
 unchanged since the prior study and might potentially reflect areas of
 infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Followup with chest
 radiograph to exclude the possibility of developing infection in the lung
 bases is recommended.
