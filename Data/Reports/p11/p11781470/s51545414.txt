                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are slightly hyperexpanded, unchanged from prior
 radiographs.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild thickening of
 the pleura at the apices is unchanged.  Enteric tube has its tip in the
 stomach but side port at the GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube terminates in the stomach but the side port is at the GE
 junction and should be advanced for more optimal positioning.
