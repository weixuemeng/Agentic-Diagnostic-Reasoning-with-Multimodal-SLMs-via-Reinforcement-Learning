 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evaluation is
 quite limited given the low lung volumes.  The heart is moderately enlarged,
 though this appears stable from prior.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia
 or overt CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aorta is stably unfolded
 with areas of atherosclerotic calcification along the arch.  Bony structures
 appear grossly intact.  Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without signs of pneumonia or overt CHF.
