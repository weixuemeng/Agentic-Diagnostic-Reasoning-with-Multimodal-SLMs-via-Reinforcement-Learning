                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent left chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
 focal pneumonia.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests underlying chronic
 pulmonary disease.
