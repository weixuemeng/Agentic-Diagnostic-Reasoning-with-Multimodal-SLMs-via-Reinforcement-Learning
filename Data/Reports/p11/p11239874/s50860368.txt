 aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and MR total spine
 performed on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube, its
 tip which terminates 4 cm above the level of the carina, appropriately
 positioned.  There is been interval removal of a left PICC.  Low lung volumes
 results in central vascular crowding and apparent cardiomegaly.  Retrocardiac,
 mild biapical medial as well as right lower lobe opacities are new since prior
 study performed ___ and correspond to consolidations present on
 MR total spine performed on the same date.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal opacities most likely reflect sequela of aspiration.
 
 Appropriately placed endotracheal tube.
