                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of known right upper lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in appearance of the right upper lobe opacity, partly caused by a known mass
 and partly by local hemorrhage after biopsy.  The lung volumes have overall
 decreased, explaining the increased radiodensity at both lung bases.  No
 pleural effusions are seen.  The pre-existing minimal interstitial fluid
 overload has resolved.
