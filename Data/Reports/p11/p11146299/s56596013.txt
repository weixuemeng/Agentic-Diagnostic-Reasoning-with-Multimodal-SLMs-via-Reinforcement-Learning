                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung adenocarcinoma, with a presumed parapneumonic effusion on the
 left, with the pigtail catheter to waterseal.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate multiple sternotomy
 wires and a pigtail catheter within the left hemithorax.  The loculated left
 pleural effusion appears slightly decreased compared to the most recent chest
 radiograph, with improved aeration of the left lung.  Right lung aeration
 appears unchanged.  A minimal right pleural effusion is new.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Slightly decreased loculated left pleural effusion with improved aeration
 of the left lung.  
 
 2. New minimal right pleural effusion.
