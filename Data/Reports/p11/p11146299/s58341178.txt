                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malignant loculated pleural effusion, status post chest tube
 placement, now with worsening hypoxia and minimal drain output.  Evaluate for
 enlargement of effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pigtail pleural catheter is unchanged in location,
 projecting over the left ventricle.  A moderate loculated left pleural
 effusion is not significantly changed in size.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion, unchanged.  Heterogeneous bilateral lower lung opacities are likely
 minimal atelectasis, not significantly changed.  There is mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, unchanged.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Midline sternotomy wires are again noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged moderate loculated left pleural effusion.  
 
 2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 4.  Unchanged bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
