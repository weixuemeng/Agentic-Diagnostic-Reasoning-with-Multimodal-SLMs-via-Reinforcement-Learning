 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Mild asymmetry of the hilar structures, with prominent left
 main pulmonary artery contour is unchanged from prior study.  There is subtle
 increased heterogeneous opacity in the lower posterior lung fields, most
 clearly on lateral view with possible retrocardiac frontal correlate worrisome
 for infection.  The lung apices are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle heterogeneous opacity in the lower posterior lung fields
 most clearly seen on the lateral view, worrisome for infection.
