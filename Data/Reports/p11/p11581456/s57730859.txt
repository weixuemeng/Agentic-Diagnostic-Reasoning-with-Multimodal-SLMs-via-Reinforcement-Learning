                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload and shortness of breath, to assess for the lung
 changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed and compared with the
 prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Both lungs are clear.  There are no lung opacities of concern.  Very minimal
 bibasilar opacity is probably attributed to suboptimal inspiratory effort and
 is likely bibasilar atelectasis.  No lung opacities concerning for pneumonia. 
 Left posterior costophrenic angle blunting is likely from combination of
 effusion and pleural thickening, unchanged since ___.  Top normal
 heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
