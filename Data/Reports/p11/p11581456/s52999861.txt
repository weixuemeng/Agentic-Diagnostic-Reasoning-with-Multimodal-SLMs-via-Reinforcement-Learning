                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, SBP questionable septic emboli.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum with the termination in expected
 location, though the tip is not seen.  There is a right-sided central line in
 the distal SVC, unchanged.  Secondary to the patient's known massive ascites,
 there are extremely low lung volumes with atelectasis, more pronounced on the
 right side.  There are patchy linear infiltrates, particularly in the left mid
 zone, improved from prior study, and there are findings suggestive of fine
 nodules in the right upper lung zone.  These are probably look smaller from
 prior study, but again, given the history, septic emboli would certainly again
 be suggested if the patient has known septicemia.  No additional findings of
 note.
 
 CT from previous day, suggesting that these changes are less likely typical of
 septic emboli.
 
 CONCLUSION
 
 Slight improved appearances.
