                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cirrhosis and SBP with chest x-ray
 concerning for septic emboli, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable radiograph from ___, CT chest without contrast
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are very low.  Patchy infiltrates in the right and
 left upper lung are mostly unchanged from the prior study.  These findings
 correlate to the multifocal ground-glass opacities seen on CT chest from two
 days prior, likely multifocal pneumonia or hemorrhage.   A right internal
 jugular line is seen in the distal SVC, unchanged.  NG tube has been removed. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities in the upper lung zones correlate to multifocal
 ground-glass opacities seen on CT chest, likely infection versus hemorrhage
 and less likely septic emboli.
