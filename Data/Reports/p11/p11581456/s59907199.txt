 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, diuretic-resistant ascites, evaluation for
 cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of extremely low lung volumes with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung
 bases and crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette, minimal fluid overload might be present, but there
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia or larger pleural
 effusions.
