  1. Increased right tracheal stripe, stable since ___ but new since ___
  ___, which could represent developing tortuosity of mediastinal vessels.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dysphagia and elevated white count.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable with calcification of the
 aortic knob. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is stable since ___
 but new since ___.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy
 opacification at the left lung base may be consistent with atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Left lower lobe consolidation which may be consistent with aspiration or
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe, which is new since ___ but
 stable since ___. While this may represent developing tortuosity of
 mediastinal vasculature, a PA chest radiograph is recommended on a nonurgent
 basis for further evaluation.
