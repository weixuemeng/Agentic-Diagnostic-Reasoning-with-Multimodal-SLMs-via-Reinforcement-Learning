                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath  // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, no definite change is detected.
 
 Again seen is a small posterior left pleural effusion, question on the left,
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, grossly similar to the prior
 study.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases the blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is also similar.
 
 Within the right and left upper and mid zones, no focal infiltrate is
 identified.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly and aortic calcification, unchanged.
 
 No CHF.   No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Hyperinflation, suggestive of background COPD.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacity in the lower lobe posteriorly, probably on the left,
 appears to represent a combination of a small amount of pleural fluid and
 patchy parenchymal opacity.  The possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate and/or
 area of  aspiration should be considered.
 2. Patchy opacities at the right an left lung bases are compatible with
 atelectasis and/or scarring and are not clearly changed.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.  No CHF or pneumothorax detected.
