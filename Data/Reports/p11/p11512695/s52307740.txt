 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:00 AM
  New near complete opacification of left hemithorax without significant
  mediastinal shift or tracheal deviation.  Given short interval development,
  findings are concerning for either asymmetric pulmonary edema or new
  consolidation.  There could also be a component overlying pleural fluid
  although this is felt less likely given lack of mediastinal shift.  As per
  discussion with Dr. ___ on ___ at 00:55, 5 minutes after
  discovery there has been no significant increase in drain output to suggest
  large amount of fluid.
