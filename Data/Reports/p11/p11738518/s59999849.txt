                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rsp distress  // pulmedema? mucous plug?  
 pulmedema? mucous plug?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ ___ at 05:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP semi-erect portable chest film ___ at 23:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line now courses across the midline and heads cephalad in
 the proximal right brachiocephalic vein near its junction with the SVC.
 Repositioning would be recommended. However, it is noted that the patient was
 subsequently imaged on ___ at 10 am and on that study, the PICC
 line is now in satisfactory position.  The left basilar opacity and associated
 small effusion are unchanged likely reflecting compressive atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is stable pulmonary
 vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart remains enlarged.
 Overall mediastinal contours are stable.
