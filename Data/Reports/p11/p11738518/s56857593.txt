                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD and bile leak s/p intubation.  // ?
 ETT placement      ? ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 23:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 10:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the proximal SVC. Interval
 placement of an endotracheal tube that has its tip at the carina heading
 toward the proximal right mainstem bronchus and needs to be pulled back 3-4
 cm.  A nasogastric tube is now seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  A biliary stent is in place. A portion of a descending aortic
 stent is visualized.
 
 The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is
 increasing consolidation at the left base with an associated effusion. These
 findings are most consistent with increasing lower lobe collapse rather than
 worsening pneumonia given the position of the ETT tube at this time.  The
 right lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The patient's nurse, ___, was notified of the need to
 reposition the ETT tube on ___ at 12:40pm at the time of discovery.
