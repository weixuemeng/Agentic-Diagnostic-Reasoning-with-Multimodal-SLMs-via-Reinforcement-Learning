                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, on BiPAP.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is present with vascular indistinctness and perihilar
 haziness.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe may suggest the
 presence of tortuous vessels. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 
 2.  Widened right paratracheal stripe may be related to tortuous vessels but
 underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  Comparison with prior exams is
 recommended, or a CT of the chest can be obtained for further evaluation.
