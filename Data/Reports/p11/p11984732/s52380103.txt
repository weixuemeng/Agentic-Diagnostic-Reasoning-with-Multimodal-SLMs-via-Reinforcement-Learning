                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with upper abdominal pain radiating to the back.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen a left-sided pacer unit with leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips associated
 with post-CABG changes are stable.  The heart size is stably enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the
 aortic knob with a mildly tortuous aorta.  The lungs are clear of
 consolidation and while the pulmonary vasculature is prominent, there is no
 septal thickening to suggest pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly and post-CABG changes, but no evidence of pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema.
