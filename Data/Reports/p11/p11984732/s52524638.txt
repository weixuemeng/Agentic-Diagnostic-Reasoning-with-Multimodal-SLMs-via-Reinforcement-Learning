                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post dual-chamber pacemaker for AV
 block.  Assess pacemaker leads.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were obtained.  Left-sided pacemaker and
 both pacemaker leads are in unchanged position, in the expected positions of
 the right atrium and ventricle.  There is interval decrease of pulmonary edema
 with small bilateral effusions and atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomegaly, aortic calcifications, and post-CABG findings are stable. Right
 humerus is incompletely assessed on this image but appears high riding
 suggesting degenerative rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in degree of pulmonary edema with small
 bibasilar effusions.
