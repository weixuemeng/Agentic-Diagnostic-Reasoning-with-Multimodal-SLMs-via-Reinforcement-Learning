                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of CABG, chronic heart failure.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increasing
 amount of right pleural effusion, the extent of the effusion is now moderate. 
 There is unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and moderate
 cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, likely caused by the left pleural effusion.  Sternal wires
 and clips after CABG are in unchanged position.  Unchanged position of the
 pacemaker leads.
