 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension and hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest.  New compared to priors is dense retrocardiac
 opacity.  There is also a right basilar opacity silhouetting the costophrenic
 angle.  Findings may be due to pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis
 or infection also possible.  Pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct. 
 Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged, unchanged given differences in
 technique and rotation to the left.  Left chest wall dual lead pacing device
 is again noted as well as median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left greater than right bibasilar opacities
 suggesting underlying effusions noting atelectasis or component of infection,
 particularly on the left is also possible.
