 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has received a nasogastric tube.  The tip of the tube
 projects 5.5 cm above the carina.  The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm, given
 its relatively high location.  There is no evidence of complications, notably
 no pneumothorax.  At the bases of the right lung, an area of atelectasis is
 seen.  No pneumonia.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.
