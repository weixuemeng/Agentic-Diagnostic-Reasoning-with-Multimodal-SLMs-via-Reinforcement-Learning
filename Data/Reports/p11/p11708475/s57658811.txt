                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout of CT torso of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina.  Heart
 size is normal.  There has been previous right upper lobe resection procedure
 with hyperexpansion of the remaining right middle and right lower lobes and an
 area of pleural thickening or fluid at the right apex.  Left-sided pulmonary
 vascular congestion and unilateral interstitial pattern probably reflects
 asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema and less likely an interstitial
 infection.  There is also a probable layering left pleural effusion on this
 semi-upright radiograph.  No visible pneumothorax.
