 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Patient
 rotation and relatively low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Note is made of previous right upper lobe resection with associated
 volume loss in right hemithorax.  Pulmonary edema pattern in the left lung has
 slightly improved.  Small to moderate left pleural effusion persists, and
 there is also a new moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower
 lobe atelectasis.
