                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, its distal course not imaged
 beyond the gastric cardia.  A left-sided PICC line terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Small-to-moderate layering pleural effusions are suspected.  A mild
 interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary congestion, but similar to perhaps
 somewhat improved.  Right apical pleural thickening is stable and persistent
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm reflects postsurgical volume
 loss.
 
 IMPRESSION: Suspected pleural effusions and findings suggesting pulmonary
 congestion.
