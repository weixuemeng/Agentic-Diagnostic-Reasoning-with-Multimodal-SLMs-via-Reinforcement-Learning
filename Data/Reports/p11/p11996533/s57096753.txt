                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with continued  shortness of breath and dyspnea on
 exertion after recent influenza A/ multifocal pneumonia and ARDS ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits, substantially decreased in size compared
 to the prior exams.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Hilar contours have
 decreased in size, with minimal fullness of the right hila likely reflective
 of residual lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear opacity
 in the left mid lung field likely reflects atelectasis or scarring. 
 Previously demonstrated diffuse airspace opacities have resolved.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously noted diffuse airspace opacities have resolved with only minimal
 residual atelectasis or scarring in the left mid lung field.  No new focal
 consolidation.  No pulmonary edema with normalization of the heart size.
