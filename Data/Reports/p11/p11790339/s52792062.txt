                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage with possible pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  The left central venous line tip is at
 the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged, but there is interval increase in bilateral pleural
 effusions and potentially worsening of vascular congestion.  No definitive
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen, but it cannot be excluded due to
 obscuration by layering large pleural effusions.
