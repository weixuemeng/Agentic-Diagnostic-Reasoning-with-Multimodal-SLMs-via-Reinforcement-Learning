                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R sided CP x 1 week with dyspnea  // eval ?
 pneumothorax, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lung
 fields are clear. There is no pneumothorax, fracture or dislocation.  Limited
 assessment of the abdomen is unremarkable.  Linear and nodular opacities
 projecting over the the right upper lobe and the soft tissues of the right
 supraclavicular chest are likely artifactual (possibly due to hair braids or
 extraneous tubular structures).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2.  Linear and nodular opacities projecting over the right upper lobe and the
 soft tissues of the right supraclavicular chest are likely artifactual.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A nonurgent repeat chest radiograph is recommended with
 removal or repositioning of external structures in order to exclude the
 possibility of a lung parenchymal abnormality in the right upper lobe.
