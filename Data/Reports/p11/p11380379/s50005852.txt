  Lower lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.  However, more
  indistinct, cephalized pulmonary vessels suggests a component of vascular
  congestion and failure. No new focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp, sob.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiographs, lung volumes are lower causing
 bronchovascular crowding.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  New
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature may be due to crowding, but also
 from a component of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No new focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  Intact median sternotomy wires.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.  However, more
 indistinct, cephalized pulmonary vessels suggests a component of vascular
 congestion.  No new focal consolidation.
