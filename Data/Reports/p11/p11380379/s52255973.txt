                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough.  History of pneumonia last
 year and did not have interval followup.  Never smoked cigarettes.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia and possible resolution of abnormal findings one year ago.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery as before.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present but no
 typical configurational abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of pleural effusion in
 either lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  No pneumothorax identified in
 apical area on frontal view.  Moderately accentuated kyphotic curvature in the
 thoracic spine with moderately demineralized vertebral bodies, but no evidence
 of compression fracture.
 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, sizable parenchymal infiltrate existed in the right upper lobe anterior
 segment.  This pneumonic infiltrate has regressed completely and presently no
 acute parenchymal infiltrates can be seen.  Comparison is extended to older
 chest examination of ___, at which time the patient already had
 undergone bypass surgery with sternotomy wires and multiple surgical clips. 
 Comparison with this more than ___-year-old examination demonstrates stable
 chest findings status post bypass surgery with mild cardiac enlargement but
 absence of pulmonary vascular congestion and no acute infiltrates.
