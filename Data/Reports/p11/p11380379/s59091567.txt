 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:12 PM
  Low lung volumes, however, the mediastinum appears widened compared to prior
  studies, which raises the possibility of aortic dissection.  CT of the chest
  with contrast can be done if there is clinical suspicion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and fall.  Left-sided chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Lung volumes are low which
 crowd the vascular markings.  There is likely some pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The mediastinum appears widened compared to prior studies, which
 could be in part due to low lung volumes and technique.  No focal
 consolidations are seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The
 sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  The mediastinum appears widened compared to
 prior studies, which could be technical and due to low lung volume however but
 it also raises the possibility of acute aortic syndrome.  CT of the chest with
 contrast can be done if there is clinical suspicion.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 9:45am on ___ at the time of discovery.
