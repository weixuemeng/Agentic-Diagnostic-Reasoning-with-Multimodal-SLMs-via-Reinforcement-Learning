                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic small cell lung cancer with
 right posterior rib pain, occasional wheezing on exam, getting nivolumab  //
 eval for effusion, fracture, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right upper lobe post radiation fibrosis is unchanged.  The round and
 well-circumscribed lesion abutting the right chest wall corresponds to the
 pleural nodule seen on recent chest CT, larger compared to on chest CT.
 Multiple soft tissue density lesions are also seen along the radiation
 fibrosis.  CT can further characterize these lesions.  The lungs are otherwise
 well expanded and clear.  Bilateral pleural effusion is mild.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No obvious osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Multiple soft tissue densities along the line of radiation fibrosis
 including a enlarging pleural nodule previously seen  on recent CT.
 
 2.  Mild bilateral pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest can further characterize the soft tissue
 densities seen along the line of radiation fibrotic changes.
