                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with small cell lung cancer with R sided drain
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The drain is poorly visualized
 though appears to extend from the lateral right lung base, then courses
 medially at the level of the hilum along the posterior pleura and terminate in
 the medial posterior- basal right pleural space.  There is continued decrease
 in right pleural effusion.  In this patient with extensive metastatic disease
 within the chest, residual opacities in the right hemi thorax likely
 correspond with known sites of metastatic involvement.  The left lung remains
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
