                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with mild pain, shortness of breath associated with
 recent right thoracentesis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube terminates in unchanged position with tip projecting
 along the medial base of the right hemi thorax.  Again demonstrated is a right
 hilar mass with hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple pleural-based masses
 compatible with metastases, better assessed on the previous CT.  Fiducial
 markers are noted within the superior aspect of the left hilar mass as well as
 within the right upper lobe, unchanged.  A moderate size right pleural
 effusion may be minimally increased in size compared to the prior study with
 worsening airspace opacification in the right lung base which may reflect
 worsening atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Apart from subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the
 left lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 the heart size appearing within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted throughout the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacification in the right lung base which may reflect increased
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Moderate size right pleural
 effusion also appears minimally increased from prior.  Grossly unchanged
 appearance of right hilar mass and multiple pleural-based metastases.  No
 pneumothorax.
