                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with afib , palpitations.  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Chronic upper zone
 vascular redistribution without overt edema.  Lung volumes are low resulting
 in crowding of bronchovascular structures, particularly at the lung bases.  No
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia.  If clinical suspicion persists, a repeat PA radiograph
 with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete assessment of
 the lung bases.
