                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Heavy smoking, cough and weight loss.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There are streaky right
 infrahilar opacities in the right lower lobe, but more suggestive of
 atelectasis than pneumonia.  Likewise, there is also suspected minor
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  The lungs appear otherwise clear
 without suspicious findings.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear mildly hyperinflated.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic findings suspicious for malignancy; however chest
 CT is much more sensitive for malignancy if there is substantial clinical
 concern.
