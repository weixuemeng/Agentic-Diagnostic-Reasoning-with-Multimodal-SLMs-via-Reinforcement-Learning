                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea and tachypnea. Evaluate for pneumonia or other
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower. There is no opacity to
 suggest pneumonia. The azygos vein and pulmonary vessels appear more
 prominent, consistent with worsening vascular congestion. There is no frank
 pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in the degree of vascular congestion. No evidence of
 pneumonia.
