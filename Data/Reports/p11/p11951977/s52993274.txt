                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest show an opacity within the left lingula.  In
 the lateral projection only, there is a small rounded opacity which likely
 represents a pleural abnormality.  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is no evidence of interstitial edema.  There is mild dextroscoliosis of
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lingular pneumonia.
 2.  Probable small pleural abnormality at the left base.  Would recommend
 followup chest x-ray in four weeks to assess for change.
