                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left shoulder pain and known left upper lobe lesion.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate severe cardiomegaly. 
 Mitral valve prosthesis is in place.  AICD leads are unchanged in position. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  Lung volumes are slightly
 decreased.  Left upper lobe opacity likely corresponds to patient's known part
 solid, part ground-glass lesion, better characterized on prior CT.  Perihilar
 vascular congestion is noted.  Intrathoracic aorta is tortuous.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Rim calcified lesions in the left upper abdomen
 correspond to patient's known calcified splenic lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left upper medial lung opacities likely correspond to patient's known part
 solid, part ground-glass lesion with associated satellite nodules, better
 defined on ___ CT exam.  ___ consider repeat chest CT to assess for
 interval change.
 
 2.  Severe cardiomegaly, unchanged.
