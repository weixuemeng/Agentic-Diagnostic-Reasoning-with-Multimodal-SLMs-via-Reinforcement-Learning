                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A rim-calcified density projecting over the posterior left lower
 chest reflects a splenic pseudocyst based on the prior CT and appears
 unchanged.  The heart is again markedly enlarged with a globular
 configuration, but unchanged.  The patient is status post mitral and tricuspid
 valve replacements.  There is a single-lead pacemaker on the right with a lead
 extending into the coronary sinus.  Via the left-sided pacemaker box, there
 are two leads that terminate in the right ventricle.  A mild-to-moderate
 interstitial abnormality in addition to enlargement of central pulmonary
 vessels suggests similar mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There is also a
 persistent small-to-moderate left-sided pleural effusion with some shifting
 but probably no substantial change in overall size as well as associated
 atelectasis.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are
 noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar findings including mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion and left-sided pleural effusion.
