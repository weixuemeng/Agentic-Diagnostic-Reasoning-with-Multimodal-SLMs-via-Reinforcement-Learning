                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, severe cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small region of heterogeneous opacification has developed at the base of the
 right lung extending into the posterior pleural sulcus.  Lateral view does not
 support diagnosis of appreciable pleural effusion.  Therefore, I think this is
 pneumonia in the right lower lung.  Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement are chronic, but there is no good evidence for pulmonary edema. 
 Patient has had aortic and tricuspid valve replacement.  Transvenous right and
 left ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.  A right ventricular
 pacer defibrillator lead tip projects over the floor of the right ventricular
 apex, proximal electrode spanning the SVC and upper right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
