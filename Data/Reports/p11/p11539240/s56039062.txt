                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pneumonia and worsening hypoxia, assess progression.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained.  The pacer and AICD
 devices are again seen projecting over the bilateral chest wall with catheter
 extending into the right ventricle and coronary sinus.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and prosthetic cardiac valve unchanged.  The heart remains markedly
 enlarged.  There is slight worsening of pulmonary interstitial edema compared
 with the prior exam. There is consolidation again noted at the right lung base
 which is similar to prior.  Calcified lesion again noted in the left upper
 quadrant, which is compatible with a calcified splenic cystic lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly with interval development of mild
 interstitial edema.  Unchanged consolidation in the right lung base which
 remains concerning for pneumonia.
