                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hiccups and shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a normal sized heart.  Hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  A small to moderate right pleural effusion
 appears to have been present on prior examination, not significantly changed,
 with apparent loculation.  No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia is
 present.  There is no pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary edema.  Imaged
 osseous structures and upper abdomen demonstrate no acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right pleural effusion present on prior examination and not significantly
 changed.  Given apparent loculation, a CT may be performed to further assess
 if clinically indicated.
 2.  No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.
