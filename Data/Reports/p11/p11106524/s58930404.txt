                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, newly on dialysis. 
 Bradycardia and hypotension.  Hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Relatively symmetric perihilar and basal
 consolidative abnormality, right greater than left accompanied by very small
 right pleural effusion could be atypical edema. There is no way to exclude
 multifocal pneumonia, but it is quite extensive and sudden, which should be
 apparent clinically. 
 
 New right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the low SVC and upper
 right atrium.  Contralateral shift of the trachea is new, probably a small
 hematoma.  When I discussed the case with the house officer caring for this
 patient, he volunteered that the patient had received a blood product
 transfusion several hours before this study, and, of course the findings fit
 well with TRALI.
