                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Lung volumes are
 low. There is persistent perihilar fullness and interstitial abnormality
 suggesting pulmonary edema. There is a new focal opacity developing at the
 base of the right lung. There is no definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent findings suggesting pulmonary edema, probably similar allowing for
 differences in technique, but new developing focal right lower low lung
 opacity. Differential considerations include pneumonia or perhaps asymmetric
 pulmonary edema among other possible etiologies.
