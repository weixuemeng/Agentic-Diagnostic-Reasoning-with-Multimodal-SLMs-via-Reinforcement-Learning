                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man complaining of cough.  // Any disorder in the
 chest that may be causing non-productive cough?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities as well as hilar fullness
 are seen which could represent moderate pulmonary edema, particularly since
 chest radiograph in ___ showed mild cardiomegaly and upper lobe pulmonary
 vascular engorgement, signs of cardiac decompensation, however infection
 should be considered in the appropriate setting. There may be small bilateral
 pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The heart is top-normal in size and the
 aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate, basal predominant pulmonary edema most likely, although viral
 infection can give similar findings.
