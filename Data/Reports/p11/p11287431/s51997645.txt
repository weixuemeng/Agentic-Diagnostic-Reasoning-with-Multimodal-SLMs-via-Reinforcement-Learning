                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and shortness of breath.  Rule
 out infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show mild interstitial opacities with a more
 confluent opacity in the left lower lobe.  The cardiac silhouette is normal. 
 The mediastinal silhouette is widened.  The hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly widened mediastinum is likely related to tortuous aorta that is
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
 Mild interstitial edema and left lower lobe atelectasis.
