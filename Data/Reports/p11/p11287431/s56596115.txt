                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fever.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph dated back to ___, most recently from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:   There is blurring of detail due to respiratory motion.  Moderately
 severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Mediastinum is persistently widened by a
 tortuous aorta and probably also vascular ectasia.  There is mild perihilar
 vascular engorgement; however, no significant pulmonary edema is identified. 
 Increase in opacity in the retrocardiac region may be secondary to atelectasis
 and overlao of vascular shadows; however, an acute infectious process cannot
 be excluded.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Again seen is hyperinflatipm and flattered diaphragms suggesting bacground
 COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Subtle increase in opacity at the retrocardiac region may be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. MIld
 vascular plethora.
