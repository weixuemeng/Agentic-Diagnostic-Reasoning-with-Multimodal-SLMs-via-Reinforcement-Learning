                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M presenting with lower extremity edema and cough  //
 please evaluate for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the knob.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Hilar contours are similar.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 mild emphysematous changes again noted predominantly in the upper lobes. 
 Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggests trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely atelectasis.  Mild emphysema.
