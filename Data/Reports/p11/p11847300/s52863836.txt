                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post paraesophageal hernia
 repair with gastropexy, check interval changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the preoperative chest examination of
 ___.  Heart size is unchanged.  Mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable.  The on previous examination large retrocardiac density presumed
 to represent the sizable hiatal hernia has now disappeared.  Identified is now
 the diaphragmatic contour on the left side as well as the contour of the
 descending aorta.  This excludes persistence of a large-sized hernia at the
 present time.  Correspondingly, the retrocardiac density has also disappeared
 on the lateral view.  No new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities are seen and
 no pneumothorax is identified.
