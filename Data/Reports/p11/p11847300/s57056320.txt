                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of hiatal hernia and recent volvulus, now
 presents with nausea and decreased p.o. tolerance.  Patient is scheduled for
 planned repair tomorrow.  Assess for hernia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperinflated lungs
 and flattening of hemidiaphragms.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.  Large retrocardiac opacity,
 likely represents the patient's known hiatal hernia.  There is relative
 paucity of gas within imaged upper abdomen.  Visualized osseous structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large retrocardiac opacity likely represents patient's known hiatal
 hernia. 
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs and flattened hemidiaphrags likely signify underlying
 emphysema.
