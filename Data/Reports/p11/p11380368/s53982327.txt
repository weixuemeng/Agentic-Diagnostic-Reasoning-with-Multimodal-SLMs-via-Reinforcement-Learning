                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of metastatic prostate cancer, known
 malignant effusion, status post fall and possible pneumonia on outside
 hospital chest x-ray.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Right mid lung lateral opacity is in relation
 to pleural abnormality, irregularity and poor visualization of the sixth right
 rib, and coarse irregular calcifications in the right chest wall in the
 axillary region.  There is a moderate right pleural effusion.  There is a
 small left pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  There is a non-displaced rib fracture in the
 ninth left rib of unknown chronicity.  Evaluation of right rib fracture is
 limited due to the above described abnormality.  Patient has known rib mets.
 
 Right upper lobe perihilar opacity is consistent with pneumonia.
