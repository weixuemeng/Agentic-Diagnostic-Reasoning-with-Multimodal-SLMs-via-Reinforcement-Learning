                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 9:24 a.m., the lung edge is seen at the right lung
 apex, raising the question of a tiny pneumothorax.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen are bilateral effusions with underlying parenchymal changes and a
 focal opacity in the right mid zone laterally. Poor visualization of the right
 fifth and sixth posterior ribs is noted raising the question of a rib lesion.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral effusions and parenchymal changes essentially unchanged compared
 with earlier the same day.
 2.  Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax.
 3.  Abnormal increased density along right chest wall is unchanged, but of
 uncertain etiology.  If clinically indicated, CT could help to further
 characterize this abnormality.
 4.  Poor visualization of the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs.  Has there
 been prior surgical resection?  Otherwise, rib lesions would be suspected.
 
 Call placed to ordering physician Dr ___ at 10:48 am on ___
 (___, voicemail).
