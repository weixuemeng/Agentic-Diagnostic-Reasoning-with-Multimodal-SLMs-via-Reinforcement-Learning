  1. Mild right upper lobe bronchiectasis.  2.  Increase in small retrocardiac
  opacity is worrisome for early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
  3.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Prominence of right hilus due
  to patient rotation superimposed atelectasis and scarring.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with "pain" .  Assess etiology of pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  New retrocardiac
 opacity causing obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is noted.  Stable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Top-normal heart size is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. 
 Mild prominence of the right hilus is most likely due to patient rotation and
 superimposed atelectasis and scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increase in small retrocardiac opacity is worrisome for early pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Prominence of right hilus due to patient rotation, superimposed
 atelectasis and scarring.
