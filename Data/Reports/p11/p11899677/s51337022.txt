                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, evaluation for
 pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are relatively low.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  At the
 right lung base, a triangular area of atelectatic lung tissue is seen.  No
 lung nodules or masses.  Given the absence of prior films, short term
 radiographic followup is recommended to further observe the opacity at the
 right lung base.
