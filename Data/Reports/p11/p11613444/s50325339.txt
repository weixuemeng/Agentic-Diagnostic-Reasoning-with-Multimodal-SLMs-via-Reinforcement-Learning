                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe crepitus.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been essentially
 complete clearing of the right basilar opacification.  Minimal opacification
 at the left base most likely reflects atelectatic changes.  No evidence of
 vascular congestion.
