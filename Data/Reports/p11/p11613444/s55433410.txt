                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left PICC
 which appears to terminate in the  upper right atrium, although this may be
 related to low lung volumes.  If desired, this can be pulled back
 approximately 2.0 cm to terminate in the low SVC.  The remainder of the exam
 is largely unchanged, with slightly lower lung volumes resulting in increased
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left PICC appears to terminate in the upper right atrium, although this
 may be related to low lung volumes.  If desired, this can be pulled back
 approximately 2.0 cm to terminate in the low SVC.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 09:31 on ___.
