                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF  // evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is on change from the prior
 study.  Mediastinal contour appears similar.  There is mild central pulmonary
 vascular congestion, likely accentuated by lower lung volumes than on the
 prior study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left, are not
 substantially changed in size from the previous radiograph.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions,
 larger on the left, not substantially changed in size from the previous
 radiograph.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
