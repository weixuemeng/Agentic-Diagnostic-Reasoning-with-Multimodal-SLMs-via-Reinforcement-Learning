                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. A retrocardiac opacity is better seen in the
 lateral view. There is also apparent engorgement of the right hilum of unclear
 significance but hilar adenopathy cannot be completely excluded. The heart is
 moderately enlarged. There is no pleural effusion pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity suggestive of left lower lobe pneumonia. Right hilar
 engorgement and upper zone redistribution may be secondary to vascular
 congestion in the setting of cardiomegaly.
