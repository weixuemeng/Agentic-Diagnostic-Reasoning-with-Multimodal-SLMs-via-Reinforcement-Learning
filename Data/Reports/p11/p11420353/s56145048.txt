                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Large-volume fluid resuscitation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Opacity in the mid and left lower
 hemithorax is a combination of moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 probably unchanged from prior study allowing the difference in positioning of
 the patient.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is stable.  NG tube tip is out of
 view below the diaphragm.
