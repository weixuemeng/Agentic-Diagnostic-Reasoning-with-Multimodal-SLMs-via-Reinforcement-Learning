                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aggressive fluid resuscitation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position.  The lung volumes
 remain low.  There is an unchanged mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion with
 subsequent areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung area and at the left
 lung bases.  The pre-existing atelectasis at the right lung base is slightly
 improved.  No new parenchymal opacities have appeared in the interval.
