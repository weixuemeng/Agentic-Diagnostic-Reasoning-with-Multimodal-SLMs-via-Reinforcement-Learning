                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric cancer and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with the
 heart size within normal limits.  Mild calcification of the aortic arch is
 present.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases are compatible with atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
