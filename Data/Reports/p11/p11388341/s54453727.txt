 chest tube are present.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the
 mid thoracic trachea.  A gastric tube extends into the stomach.
 
 A retrocardiac opacity is present, likely postprocedural atelectasis and a
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax identified although there is a small amount
 of postprocedural pneumomediastinum.  There are increased right perihilar
 opacities and vascular engorgement in keeping with pulmonary edema.  A small
 layering right pleural effusion is also suspected.
