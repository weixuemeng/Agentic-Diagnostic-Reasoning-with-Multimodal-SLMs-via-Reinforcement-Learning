  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible hilar enlargement,
  particularly on the left.  This appearance could partially be accounted for by
  a tortuous descending thoracic aorta.  Dedicated chest x-ray with 2 views is
  suggested to further characterize this finding and apparent increased opacity
  projecting over the anterior right 2nd rib as well.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and elevated white blood
 cell count.  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Left PICC is seen with tip in the mid SVC.
 There is an opacity projecting over the anterior right 2nd rib, potentially
 related to osseous structures however underlying parenchymal changes are also
 possible.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  The descending thoracic
 aorta is tortuous and may account for apparent left hilar enlargement.  There
 is however possible right hilar enlargement as well.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged even given technique.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible hilar enlargement,
 particularly on the left.  This appearance could partially be accounted for by
 a tortuous descending thoracic aorta.  Dedicated chest x-ray with 2 views is
 suggested to further characterize this finding and apparent increased opacity
 projecting over the anterior right 2nd rib as well.
