 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no

 lungs may indicate slight fluid overload but there is no focal opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings that may indicate minimal fluid overload but otherwise unremarkable
 examination without convincing evidence for pneumonia.
