                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with new ascites, some difficulty breathing  // Eval for pna,
 hydrothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The appearance of the chest is
 unchanged with mild reticular opacities which could reflect mild edema or
 underlying fibrosis. No large effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of
 pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. External artifact
 projects over the right shoulder. Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Scattered bilateral reticular opacities raise concern for mild edema versus
 mild fibrosis.  Overall appearance is unchanged.
