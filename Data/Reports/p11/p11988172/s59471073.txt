                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases are slightly
 progressed and likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
