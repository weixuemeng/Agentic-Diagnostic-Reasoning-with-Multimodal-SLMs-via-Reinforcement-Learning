                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS:  
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly diminished.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 slightly elevated.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, but no other evidence of CHF.  Heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal.  The aorta is calcified and minimally unfolded. Prominence
 of the right paratracheal soft tissues likely reflects mediastinal fat and
 vascular structures in a patient of this age. Mild prominence of the pulmonary
 hila is unchanged compared with chest x-ray from ___ (interval chest CT
 demonstrated normal pulmonary hila.) No frank consolidation or effusion is
 identified.  There is a vague nodular opacity in the right mid zone laterally
 overlying the right fourth anterior and right seventh posterior ribs, without
 corresponding abnormality on the lateral radiograph -- ? artifact due to
 confluence of osseous shadows.    Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Slightly low lung volumes, but no pulmonary edema or acute focal infiltrate
 identified.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  
 
 2) Vague opacity right mid zone seen only on a PA view - ? artifact. 
 Recommend shallow oblique views of the chest for further assessment.
