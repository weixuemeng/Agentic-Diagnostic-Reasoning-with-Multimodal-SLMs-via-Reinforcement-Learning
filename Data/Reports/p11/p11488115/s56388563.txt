 R/O PULMONARY PROCESS
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Radiopaque suture material and surgical clips are projected in the left lung
 as before.  There is mild prominence of the interstitial markings.  No focal
 consolidation is apparent. The patient is rotated to the right. The right
 costophrenic sulcus is blunted the cardiac silhouette is prominent although it
 may be exaggerated by AP technique. The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable for technique. The bony
 thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the interstitial markings.  The right costophrenic sulcus is
 blunted which may be due to a small effusion. Prominent cardiac silhouette.
 Vascular congestion cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is
 recommended.
