                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  Previously seen right apical pneumothorax has completely
 resolved.  A right basal pleural catheter is in place, with a relatively
 stable large right pleural effusion.  Small to moderate left pleural effusion
 is also unchanged.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema in the right lung is unchanged.
 Known left upper lobe mass with post-obstructive collapse re-demonstrated.
 Stable sclerotic changes are seen in the T3 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in the large right and a moderate
 sized left pleural effusion.  Asymmetric right-sided pulmonary edema is
 similar.
