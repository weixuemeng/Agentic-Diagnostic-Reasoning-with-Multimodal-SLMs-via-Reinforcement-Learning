                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral pleural effusions and recent
 right-sided PleurX catheter placement.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:26.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided Pleurx catheter
 and while the pleural effusion on that side is essentially drained, there is a
 small-to-moderate pneumothorax now present.  There is no flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms or mediastinal shift to suggest tension.  The left-sided
 pleural effusion has increased, now moderate to large in size with underlying
 atelectasis.  Additionally a large hiatal hernia is present.  The aerated
 portions of lung show little change from prior exam.  Severe degenerative
 changes are present at both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided pneumothorax without evidence of tension; improvement
 of right, but increase in left, pleural effusions after right PleurX catheter
 placement.
