                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer, pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right pleural drainage catheter is in place. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  A small right pleural effusion is smaller compared to
 prior study.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the right is not changed. 
 A moderate left pleural effusion is slighter larger.  The known left upper
 lobe mass with postobstructive left upper lobe collapse is re- demonstrated
 without significant change.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in small right pleural effusion.  Slight increase
 in moderate left pleural effusion.  Unchanged left upper lobe/left upper
 mediastinal mass.  Asymmetric right-sided pulmonary edema is unchanged.
