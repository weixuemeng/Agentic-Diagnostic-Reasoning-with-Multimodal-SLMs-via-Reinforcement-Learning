                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxia, non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies, ___ and CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Patient has extensive
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy,  better seen in the prior CT.  Left upper lobe
 mass and post-obstructive atelectasis is again noted.  Pleural thickening on
 the left apex is stable.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased,
 more so on the right, with increasing adjacent atelectasis on the left.  On
 the right, the opacities are a combination of a medial mass-like
 consolidation, interlobular septal thickening and nodularity, better seen in
 prior CT.
