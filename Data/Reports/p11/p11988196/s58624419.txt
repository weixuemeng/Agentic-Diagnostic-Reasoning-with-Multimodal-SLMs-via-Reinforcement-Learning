                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and coarse breath sounds, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with hyperexpansion of the lungs
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  The difference in the degree of
 pulmonary vascularity may well reflect the portable versus upright PA view. 
 There is a right pleural effusion with associated opacification most likely
 representing atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
