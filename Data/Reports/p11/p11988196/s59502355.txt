                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with mild cough, generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The costophrenic angles are not fully included on the frontal image.  Given
 this, there is small to moderate right pleural effusion.  A trace left pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent
 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Relative lucency at the lung
 apices may be due to underlying pulmonary emphysema.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Costophrenic angles not fully included on the frontal view.  Given this,
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation can not be excluded.  Trace left pleural effusion
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 COPD and likely pulmonary emphysema.
