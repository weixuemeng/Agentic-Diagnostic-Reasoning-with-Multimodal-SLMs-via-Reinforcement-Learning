                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male who had been coded and received chest compressions
 and is now intubated.
 
 STUDY:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits just beneath the level of clavicular
 heads, which is new from prior study.  The heart size is large, but stable to
 prior exam.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic
 disease of the aortic knob.  A large calcified lymph node projects just right
 of midline.  The interstitial markings of the lungs show minimally increased
 prominence as well as prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, compatible with
 mildly increased interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  No displaced
 rib fracture is apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema and endotracheal tube as described above.
