                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusions and edema. Evaluate the
 evolution of the effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The radiographic technique is slightly apical lordotic. Crescentic lucency
 under the left and right hemidiaphragms are consistent with peumoperitoneum,
 which appears new since the prior exam. Stable bilateral low lung volumes and
 bibasilar atelectasis. Significant interval improvement in the bilateral
 pleural effusions with the probably only minimal left pleural effusion
 remaining.  Right apical pleural scarring, stable.   Diffuse nonspecific
 bilateral patchy opacities are unchanged and likely correspond to the
 ground-glass opacities seen on recent CT which may be from infection. No overt
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Stable substantial cardiomegaly. Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. Stable slight rightward deviation of the trachea
 without tracheal lumen narrowing at the level of the clavicles is likely
 secondary to the left thyroid, as suggested by the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Pneumoperitoneum, new.
 
 2.  Near complete resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Left thyroid lesion; see CT report for recommendation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___, from the referring team, on the telephone on ___ at
 3:20 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
