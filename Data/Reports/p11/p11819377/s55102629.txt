                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CVA, likely aspiration; assess infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. Correlation made to CTA head and neck dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube ends above the carina.  There are diffuse bilateral
 airspace opacities. A right upper lobe consolidation with superior
 displacement of the right hilus is most compatible with atelectasis and/or
 scarring. A retrocardiac airspace opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The heart appears enlarged
 despite the projection.  The pulmonary arteries are prominent, suggesting
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical opacification, which is been more fully evaluated on the recent
 CTA neck.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Prominent pulmonary arteries suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension.
