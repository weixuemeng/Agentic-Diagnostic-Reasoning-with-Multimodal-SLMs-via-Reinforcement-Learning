                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L ICA occlusion and stroke.  // ? pancoast
 tumor seen on CT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph from earlier today, diffuse airspace
 opacities have slightly improved at the lung bases, with better visualization
 of both hemidiaphragms.  Asymmetrical right apical thickening (apical cap) is
 similar to the prior radiograph and has been more fully evaluated on recent
 neck CTA.  Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions are demonstrated.
