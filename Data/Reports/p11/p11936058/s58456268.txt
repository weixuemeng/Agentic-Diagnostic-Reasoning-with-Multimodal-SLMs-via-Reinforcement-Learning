                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: A Dobbhoff tube is redemonstrated coursing
 into the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Heart size
 is normal.  There are low lung volumes with mild crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, and minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No overt
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Extensive
 degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted. A cervical
 fusion device again visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis, in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 Dobbhoff tube appears to be within the stomach, though tip is not definitively
 noted on the study, projecting off the inferior borders of the film.
