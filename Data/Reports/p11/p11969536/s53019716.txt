                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, status post CABG and aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is
 again seen, relatively stable in position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stably enlarged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right.  Interval removal of previously seen right internal jugular
 central venous catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No
 definite focal consolidation, although left-sided consolidation would be
 difficult to exclude.
