                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with unwitnessed fall, question rib fractures
 or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show mild interstitial opacities.  The
 evaluation is complicated due to patient rotation.  Within these limitations,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with aortic calcifications.  No
 definite evidence of aortic dilation is noted.  The cardiac silhouette, hilar
 contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Moderately severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis with joint space
 narrowing is partially imaged on the right.  No definite rib fractures are
 noted, although if rib fractures are clinical concern, then dedicated rib
 series with a marker at the site of pain is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild interstitial edema.  No definite evidence of rib fractures.
 2.  Moderately severe right glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
