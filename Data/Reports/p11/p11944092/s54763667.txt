                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Hazy bilateral interstitial opacities are noted and likely
 representative of chronic interstitial abnormalities.  Additionally, bibasilar
 opacities are noted and likely representative of atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal.  Extensive atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.
 
 Severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis changes with joint space narrowing are
 again partially imaged on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Hazy bilateral interstitial opacities are noted and likely representative
 of chronic interstitial abnormalities. No acute cardiopulmonary process
 otherwise noted.
 2. Vague lucency noted in the mid upper abdomen. It is unclear whether this
 radiograph was truly an upright radiograph or not. As a result, a dedicated
 upright or later decubitus radiograph is recommended if clinical suspicion for
 free air is high.
 
 Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 7:43 am on
 ___.
