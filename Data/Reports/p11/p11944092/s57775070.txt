                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mechanical fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is markedly tortuous and diffusely calcified but
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures is noted.  There is mild loss of the height of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, but this is unchanged when compared to the prior
 exam.  Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral and acromioclavicular
 joint are severe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
