                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Relatively low lung volumes.  Left basilar opacity is seen which
 may be due to infection or aspiration.  There is a right base opacity to a
 lesser extent, which may in part be due to overlap of vascular structures;
 however, additional site of consolidation may be present.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No large pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity raises concern for consolidation,
 which may be due to aspiration or infection.
