                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval improvement of the right basal opacity, but progression of
 the left basal opacity, although in part potentially in combination with
 atelectasis.  Upper lungs are essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is difficult to assess due to rotation of the patient.
