                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Wheeze, cough and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right mid-to-lower lung opacity again seen, decreased as compared
 to the prior study.  Again worrisome for infectious process.  There also
 appears to be bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains quite enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Right mid-to-lower
 lung zone and left lower lung zone opacities again seen, decreased on the
 right as compared to the prior, still concerning for infectious process. 
 Likely small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the right and small pleural
 effusion on the left.
