                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures are seen. 
 Please note that this study is not tailored for evaluation of nondisplaced rib
 fractures.  If there is high clinical concern for the same, dedicated rib
 series, with a radiopaque marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness is
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
