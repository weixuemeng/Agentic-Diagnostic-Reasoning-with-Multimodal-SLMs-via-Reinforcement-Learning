                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with stroke.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic arch is prominent.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for most likely present left apical granuloma, seen on the prior
 CT neck.  Rest of the lungs are unremarkable, and there is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
