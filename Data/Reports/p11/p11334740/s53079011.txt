                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Questionable opacity in the left pericardiac area is demonstrated, potentially
 representing summation of shadows.  Correlation with either anterior shallow
 obliques with chest CT might be considered appropriate in this specific case.
