                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with exertional chest pain, dyspnea,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A vague opacity
 is seen in the left lower lung which could represent a very early pneumonia. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is also noted which is most compatible with a hiatal
 hernia.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  No definite signs of CHF, though subtle Kerley B lines may indicate
 an element of mild interstitial edema.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia, subtle opacity in the left lower lung, question
 early pneumonia.  Mild interstitial edema.
