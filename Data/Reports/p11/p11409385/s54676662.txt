                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day ___ and ___ ___ radiographs, 11:30am, 4:08
 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no significant change compared to earlier same-day report.
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Heart size is likely top normal.  Again noted are confluent
 opacities in nearly the entirety of the right lung field.  Given low lung
 volumes, left lung base and portion of right lung base consolidation is likely
 atelectatic. Left lung is otherwise clear.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pneumonia, unchanged from earlier same-day study.
