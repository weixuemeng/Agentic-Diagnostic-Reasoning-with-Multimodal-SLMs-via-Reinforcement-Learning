 Please evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with 8
 triple lead pacer device extending to the right atrium, right ventricle, and
 coronary sinus distribution.  There may be minimal indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 There is increased opacification at the right base medially.  This could
 represent merely crowding of vessels.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, S developing consolidation would have to be considered, especially in
 the absence of a lateral view.
