                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with persistent cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A couple of
 bronchi seen on end demonstrate mild bronchial cuffing.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Very mild peribronchial cuffing.  Because this finding is minimal in this
 patient, it may be within normal limits, but mild small airways disease cannot
 be excluded.
