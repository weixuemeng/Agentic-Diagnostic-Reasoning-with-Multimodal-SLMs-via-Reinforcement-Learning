                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and sputum and low-grade fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval additional increase in the bronchial wall thickening as well
 as appearance of the new opacity in the left perihilar area, not clearly seen
 on the lateral view but potentially present in the superior segment of left
 lower lobe.  Given the patient's history, followup in four weeks after
 completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended for documentation of
 resolution of this most likely related to pneumonia findings.
