 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // eval pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral

 Bibasilar opacities have improved in the interval, possible minimal residua
 remaining at the left lung base.  .  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no
 large pleural effusion.  Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior
 costophrenic angles could be due to pleural thickening versus trace pleural

 from ___ is better evaluated on CT. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
