 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 5 mm calcified nodule
 projecting over the left upper lobe likely reflects a granuloma. Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are mild
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.

 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
