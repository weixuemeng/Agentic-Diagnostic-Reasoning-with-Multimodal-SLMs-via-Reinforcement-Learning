                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and right sided weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic
 calcifications again noted at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, however infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
