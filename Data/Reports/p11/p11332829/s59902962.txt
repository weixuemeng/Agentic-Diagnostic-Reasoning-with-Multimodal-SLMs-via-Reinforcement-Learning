                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show a confluent opacity in the left lower
 lobe.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  There is mild interstitial opacities bilaterally which could be
 related to low lung volumes.  A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in
 the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Sternal wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible left lower lobe opacity could represent an early pneumonia.  Mild
 interstitial edema.
