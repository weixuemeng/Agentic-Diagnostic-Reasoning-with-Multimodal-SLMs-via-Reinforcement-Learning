                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires, dual-lead left chest wall pacer are stable from prior exam. 
 The lungs appear clear bilaterally.  There is minimal blunting along the left
 CP angle best seen on lateral view which could indicate a small pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema, signs of pneumonia, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  The degree of hilar
 engorgement appears stable.  No definite signs of interstitial or alveolar
 edema.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob noted.  Bony
 structures appear stable.  Old right mid cage posterior rib deformity again
 noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with tiny left pleural
 effusion.
