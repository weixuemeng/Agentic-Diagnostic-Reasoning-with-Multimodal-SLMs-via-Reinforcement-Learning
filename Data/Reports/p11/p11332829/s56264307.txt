                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  A ___-year-old female with history of angina.
 
 COMPARISON:  From ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Given this, there is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 Old fracture deformity of the posterior right seventh rib is again seen. 
 Slight opacity in this region was seen since ___, and likely relates to
 osseous deformity.  Underlying pulmonary nodular opacity cannot be entirely
 excluded, if this is clinically relevant, given patient age, further
 evaluation with chest CT could be obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Old posterior right seventh rib fracture deformity with slight opacity
 projecting over this location, likely relating to the osseous deformity;
 however, underlying pulmonary nodule cannot be entirely excluded and if
 clinically relevant, given patient's age, patient's chest CT could be obtained
 for further evaluation.
