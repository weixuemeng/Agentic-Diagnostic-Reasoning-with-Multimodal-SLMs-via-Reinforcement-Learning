                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intracranial hemorrhage, intubated  // tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube extends to at least the gastroesophageal junction, but its tip
 extends beyond the inferior margin of the image.
 
 There are diffuse alveolar opacities bilaterally, suggestive of pulmonary
 edema.  No large pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top-normal.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina.
 2.  Diffuse alveolar opacities in the setting of underlying intracranial
 hemorrhage, may represent neurogenic pulmonary edema.
