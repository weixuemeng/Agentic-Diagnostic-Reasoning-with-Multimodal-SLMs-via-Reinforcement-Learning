                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Within the
 limitations of technique, the lungs appear clear aside from questionable vague
 increased posterior density suggesting minor atelectasis or crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  Evaluation is somewhat limited, however, by low
 lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Low lung volumes.
