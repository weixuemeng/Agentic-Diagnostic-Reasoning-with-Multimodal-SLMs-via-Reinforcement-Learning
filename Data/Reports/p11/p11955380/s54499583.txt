                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD2 CABG CT removal  // evaluate for PTX     
 evaluate for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at 11:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. Interval extubation
 and removal of the nasogastric tube. Interval removal of the left basilar
 chest tube with possible tiny left apical pneumothorax. This can be better
 assessed on followup imaging. Persistent bilateral small layering effusions
 with bibasilar patchy opacities suggestive of partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 left greater than right.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG. Overall
 cardiac contour is difficult to assess due to the low lung volumes. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.
