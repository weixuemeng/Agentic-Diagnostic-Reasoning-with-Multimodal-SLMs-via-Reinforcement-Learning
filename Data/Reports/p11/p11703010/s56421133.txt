 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:34 PM
  Significant improvement in the previously noted right lower lobe pneumonia. 
  Minimal residual airspace opacification almost certainly represents resolving
  pneumonia, but it is not possible to completely rule out previous complete
  resolution followed by interval new development of airspace opacification (but
  this is felt to be unlikely).  No significant effusion.  No hilar adenopathy. 
  No new areas of airspace consolidation.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Significant improvement in the previously noted bilateral lower (right more
 than left) lobe pneumonia.  Minimal residual airspace opacification almost
 certainly represents resolving pneumonia, but it is not possible to completely
 rule out previous complete resolution followed by interval new development of
 airspace opacification.
 No significant effusion.  No hilar adenopathy.  No new areas of airspace
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above
