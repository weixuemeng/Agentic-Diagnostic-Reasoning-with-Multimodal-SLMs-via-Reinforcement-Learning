                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:50 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the ET tube has been removed.  Tubing extending
 along the right IJ remains present and appears to be associated with a
 Swan-Ganz catheter, which overlies the pulmonary outflow tract.  The chest
 tube and mediastinal drain have been removed.   An AICD-type device is again
 noted.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF,
 possibly slightly improved.   There is increased retrocardiac density, with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior. Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion there.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of multiple lines and tubes.
 2.  Mild CHF, which may be very slightly improved.
 3.  Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
