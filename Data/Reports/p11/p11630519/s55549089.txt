                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intracranial bleed.  Nasogastric tube placed, check
 position.
 
 CHEST AND UPPER ABDOMEN 
 
 The tip of the nasogastric tube is somewhat difficult to identify but appears
 to lie at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should therefore be
 advanced.  Compared to the prior chest x-ray where the nasogastric tube is
 better seen, I think it has probably been withdrawn 1 or 2 cm.
 
 The lung fields are clear.  The bowel gas pattern is normal.
