                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of congestive heart failure and suspected
 pulmonary edema.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 NG tube, left subclavian line and ET tube are in unchanged and unremarkable
 location.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 There is overall no change in mild interstitial edema.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity, although most likely represents atelectasis and edema, can
 potentially reflect developing infection, attention to this area on the
 subsequent study is recommended.  
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
