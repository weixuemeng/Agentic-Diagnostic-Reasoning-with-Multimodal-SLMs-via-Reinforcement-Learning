                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior study.  Heart size is mild to
 moderately enlarged but relatively unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Minimal streaky bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is minimal scarring within the lung apices.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
