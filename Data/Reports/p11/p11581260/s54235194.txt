                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with known melanoma metastatic to the lung,
 now with new oxygen requirement and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, ___, ___, and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest again demonstrates large right
 upper lobe and right middle lobe masses, consistent with multiple previous
 chest studies and known history of metastatic melanoma to the lungs.  There
 has been interval development of right upper lobe and right lower lobe hazy
 opacities, which could represent atelectasis or layering pleural effusion;
 however, in the appropriate clinical context, a developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  The left lung is again seen to be clear with no pleural effusion on
 the left.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be unchanged, but
 visualization is limited due to adjacent right lung opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of right upper lobe and right lower lobe
 opacities, likely representing layering pleural effusion with a component of
 atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical context, cannot exclude a
 developing pneumonia.
 
 These findings were made at 10:20 a.m. on ___ and communicated to
 the patient's clinical team at 10:20 a.m. on ___ by telephone.
