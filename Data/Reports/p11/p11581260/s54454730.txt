                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and more recent chest CT
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a similar right upper paramediastinal mass as well as a
 right perihilar mass, compared to prior radiographs, although small
 differences would be difficult to evaluate and would be better followed by CT
 imaging.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is similar
 mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. 
 Although patchy opacities are present in the lower lungs, these are vague and
 streaky, most suggestive of minor atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.
