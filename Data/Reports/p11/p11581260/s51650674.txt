 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:24 PM
  IMPRESSION:  No definite change in metastatic masses in the right hemithorax. 
  Tracheal narrowing by a dominant mass, although present before and not
  necessarily changed, in the setting of known recent growth of metastases.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and dyspnea.  History of metastatic disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including right perihilar masses.  The contours of the mid to lower trachea
 are indistinct on the right corresponding to known tracheal narrowing
 associated with a dominant mass involving the upper mediastinum.  There is a
 more distinct round mass than before visualized in the right lower lung,
 possibly reflecting an increase in metastatic disease versus loculated pleural
 effusion since the prior radiographs, although necessarily changed when
 differences in technique are considered.  There is persistent mild elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  Patchy right basilar opacity suggests atelectasis
 in addition to extensive pleural-based metastatic disease in the right lower
 hemithorax.  The left lung remains clear.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite change in metastatic masses in the right hemithorax. 
 Tracheal narrowing by a dominant mass, although present before and not
 necessarily changed, in the setting of known recent growth of metastases.
