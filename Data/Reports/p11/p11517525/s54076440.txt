                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sarcoidosis with respiratory distress.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from the same day.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extensive bilateral opacities are noted, with near complete opacification of
 the entire right lung, better delineated on dedicated chest CT and suspicious
 for a multifocal infectious process.  There is a small right pleural effusion
 as well as a moderate left pleural effusion.  Known hilar and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute fractures
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive bilateral opacities, greater on the right, and suggestive of a
 multifocal infectious process and better delineated on dedicated chest CTA
 from same day. 
 
 2.  Extensive hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is noted and may be
 reactive disease overlying known Sarcoidosis.
