                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSTEMI and pneumonia evaluate progression of
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study, lung volumes are significantly lower
 causing bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for
 differences in lung volumes, left lung base airspace opacities are likely
 unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.  Allowing
 for this difference, left lung base very sparse opacities are likely
 unchanged.
