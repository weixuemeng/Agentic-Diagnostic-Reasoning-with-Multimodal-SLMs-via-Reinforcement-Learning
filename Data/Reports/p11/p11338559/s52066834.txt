                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, presenting with cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Allowing for this, heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is detected.  No increased
 interstitial markings to suggest a diffuse interstitial infiltrate is
 detected.  Possible minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  Mild unfolding
 of the aorta is unchanged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  Prominence of the right
 paratracheal soft tissues is likely accentuated by lordotic positioning. No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process identified.  In particular, no focal
 infiltrate or diffuse increased interstitial markings are detected.
