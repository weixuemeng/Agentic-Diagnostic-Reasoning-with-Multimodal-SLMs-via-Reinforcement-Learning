                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF, presenting with elevated troponin and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is a very kyphotic projection.  The
 lung volumes are low and the left hemidiphragm is markedly elevated. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate-sized at least, but cannot be
 completely described because the level of the diphragm is unknown.  Right
 upper lobe consolidation raises concern for pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not well visualized.  Surgical clips, presumably from prior
 CABG, are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Right upper lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.  
 2.  Technically limited study.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Consider
 obtaining true AP view or PA and lateral if possible.
