                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies of ___ and ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Right lower lobe pneumonia has
 improved, not totally resolved.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Moderate degenerative changes are present in the mid thoracic spine.  The
 lungs are hyperexpanded.  Ill-defined opacities in the right upper lobe are
 likely superimposition of normal structures.
 
 Followup in four weeks is recommended to assess complete resolution of right
 lower lobe pneumonia.  At that time shallow oblique views are recommended to
 evaluate the nodular opacities in the right upper lobe.
