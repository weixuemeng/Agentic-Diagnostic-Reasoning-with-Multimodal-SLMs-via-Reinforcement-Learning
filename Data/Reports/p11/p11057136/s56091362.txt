                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bloody sputum for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is
 consistent with emphysema.  The patient is post CABG.  In the right middle
 lobe, there are two heterogeneous opacities, the more medial opacity is more
 well marginated and slightly atypical in appearance for pneumonia.  Hemorrhage
 is another possible etiology.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart, mediastinum, and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two heterogeneous opacities in the right middle lobe may be
 pneumonia or hemorrhage.  The more medial opacity is more well marginated and
 slightly atypical in appearance for pneumonia.  If clinically indicated, chest
 CT can better assess these areas.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at ___ by telephone.
