                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent pneumonia, right-sided
 infiltrates, and hemoptysis.  Improved clinically after treatment.  Assess for
 interval resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size, status post bypass surgery
 and partial sternal resection, remaining sternotomy wire are unchanged. 
 Unchanged appearance of thoracic aorta.  No increased pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Radiographic signs of advanced chronic inflammatory pulmonary
 disease and emphysema as before.  Bullous emphysema in right upper lobe area. 
 The next preceding examination identified acute changes described as two
 heterogeneous opacities in the right middle lobe area have regressed markedly.
 The more medially located density that had more the appearance of a pneumonic
 process has actually resolved.  Remaining finding includes a linear
 atelectasis in the lower border of the right middle lobe, probably
 representing scar formation.  When comparison is extended to examinations
 dated ___ and ___, similar episodes of acute parenchymal
 infiltrates in somewhat different location existed already and had regressed.
 
 No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen on the present examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Advanced COPD and emphysema.  Marked regression of acute
 infiltrates in right middle lobe area.  These infiltrates had also been
 documented on a chest CT dated ___.
