                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  COPD, increasing cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 The patient is after at least partial median sternotomy.  The patient is also
 after CABG.  The lungs are substantially hyperinflated due to the underlying
 emphysema but essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 demonstrated.  There is a stent in the internal carotid artery on the right
 seen, partially imaged, as well as cervical spine hardware.
 
 At the left lower lung, there is a new area of nodular atelectasis but there
 is interval resolution of the right middle lobe area of atelectasis.  Followup
 of the patient in six to eight weeks for documentation of resolution of the
 left lower lung atelectasis is recommended.
