                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rib fx and L PTX  // Questions to be
 answered: eval for interval change of PTX vs PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ study the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 The hila and pleura are unremarkable.  Again seen are multiple left-sided rib
 fractures and a displaced left clavicular fracture.  There is a line along
 right apical lung which could represent a small pneumothorax though likely
 could be a finding secondary to displaced rib fragments.  There is left
 basilar atelectasis with overlying opacity which could represent developing
 superimposed pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable left rib and displaced clavicular fractures with possible adjacent
 pneumothorax.
 2. Increased left basilar atelectasis with concern for developing superimposed
 pneumonia of the left lower lobe.
