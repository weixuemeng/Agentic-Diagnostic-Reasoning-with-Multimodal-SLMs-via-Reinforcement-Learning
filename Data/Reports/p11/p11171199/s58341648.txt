                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right rib pain after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Lungs are clear.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus on the
 frontal view suggests a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 No displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left pleural effusion.  No displaced rib fractures are noted.  If there
 is continued clinical concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series
 is recommended.
