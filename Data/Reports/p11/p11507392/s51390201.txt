                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 7:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and
 dyspnea, assess for pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 7:53.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ and 7:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There are layering bilateral effusions and bibasilar air-space disease
 with an evolving more focal opacity in the left mid lung.  These findings are
 more concerning for aspiration and/or pneumonia rather than an asymmetric
 distribution of pulmonary edema given that the pulmonary vasculature appears
 well defined on the current examination.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged,
 although the left heart border is obscured by overlying air-space process.  No
 pneumothorax.
