                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is still some blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle that could represent a small effusion or pleural
 thickening.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
