                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size may be mildly enlarged though assessment is somewhat limited
 due to presence of a new small to moderate size right pleural effusion.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is present.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in
 the right may reflect compressive atelectasis but infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small to moderate size right pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
