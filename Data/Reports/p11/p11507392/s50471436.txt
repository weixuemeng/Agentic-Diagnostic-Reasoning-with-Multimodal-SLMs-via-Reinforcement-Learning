 small left and moderate right pleural effusions, unchanged. Overlying
 consolidation at the right lung base is presumably atelectasis, however,
 infection cannot be excluded.  Heart size is difficult to assess with the
 ongoing parenchymal changes. Mediastinal contours and hilar structures are
 unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
