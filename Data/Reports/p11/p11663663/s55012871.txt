                                 FINAL REPORT
 SERIES OF RADIOGRAPHS OBTAINED FOR ASSESSMENT OF NASOGASTRIC TUBE PLACEMENT 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the initial radiographs, a nasogastric tube terminates in the
 proximal thoracic esophagus just below the level of the aortic arch. 
 Subsequent radiograph labeled #3 in the series demonstrates advancement of the
 tube in the stomach, with side port just beyond the expected location of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 7 cm
 above the carina, with apparent overinflation of the cuff.  This could be
 advanced by about 2 cm for standard positioning.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion is similar to the prior study, but adjacent atelectasis at the right
 base has slightly improved.
