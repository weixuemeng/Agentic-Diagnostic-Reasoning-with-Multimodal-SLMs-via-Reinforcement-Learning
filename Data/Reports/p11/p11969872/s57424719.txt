 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough since two months, rule out infiltrate, mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 Lingular atelectasis band is new superimposed to possible bronchiectasis
 previously seen in ___ and ___ could be due to mucus plugging.  The
 remaining of the lungs is unremarkable.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 New lingular atelectasis band is possibly due to mucus impaction in
 bronchiectasis.  This could either be investigated by CT to rule out an
 endobronchial mass. A followup short-term chest x-ray could also be done after
 treatment to ensure resolution.
