 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:02 PM
  IMPRESSION:  
  
  1.  No evidence of acute disease including no evidence for pleural effusion.  
  
  2.  Soft tissue density in the lower mediastinum suspected to represent a
  hiatal hernia but not entirely characterized; it is difficult to exclude an
  aneurysm.  If more remote prior radiographs are not available to show
  stability of this appearance, then characterization should be considered with
  chest CT when clinically appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Question pleural effusion on the left.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The patient is status post coronary
 artery bypass graft surgery.  The aortic arch is calcified.  There is again an
 expansile soft tissue opacity along the lower mediastinum immediately above
 the thoracic inlet.  Mild to moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left is noted.  There is no evidence for pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  The bones are probably
 demineralized to some degree.
