  Mild cephalization of pulmonary blood flow is of uncertain chronicity.  If
  acute it would indicate early cardiac decompensation.

  Mild vascular congestion.

  Mild equalization of blood flow is likely chronic in nature however there are
  no prior studies to assess for interval change.  If acute finding this may
  suggest very early decompensation.

 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates well expanded lungs with mild
 equalization of blood flow.No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted.  Mediastinum contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cephalization of pulmonary blood flow is of uncertain chronicity. If
 acute it would indicate early cardiac decompensation.
