 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:30 AM
  Lateral right chest not completely included on the image.  Multiple displaced
  left-sided rib fractures with overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
  The left diaphragm is obscured which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration,
  pleural effusion, pulmonary contusion.  The right lung is not well assessed,
  but is lower in volume than that on the left. Relative opacity projecting over
  the partially imaged right lung could be due to layering pleural effusion,
  aspiration, and/or pulmonary contusion.
  
  Partially imaged right sided chest tube is noted which appears to course to
  the mediastinum, distal aspect obscured by overlying pacer lead.
  Possible small left pneumothorax.  Right sided ptx not well seen on this
  study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CPR, chest tube on R  // ? PTX on L, s/p chest
 tube on R. intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lateral chest is not fully included on the image.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 3 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm,
 out of the field of view.  Partially imaged right sided chest tube is noted
 which appears to course to the mediastinum.  There is extensive left chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema and multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures,
 including left third through seventh ribs, and possibly eighth rib.  The left
 diaphragm is obscured which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, pleural
 effusion, pulmonary contusion.  The right lung is not well assessed, but is
 lower in volume than that on the left.  Relative opacity projecting over the
 partially imaged right lung could be due to layering pleural effusion,
 aspiration, and/or pulmonary contusion.
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacer device has leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lateral right chest not completely included on the image.  Multiple displaced
 left-sided rib fractures with overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
 The left diaphragm is obscured which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration,
 pleural effusion, pulmonary contusion.  The right lung is not well assessed,
 but is lower in volume than that on the left.  Relative opacity projecting
 over the partially imaged right lung could be due to layering pleural
 effusion, aspiration, and/or pulmonary contusion.
 
 Partially imaged right sided chest tube is noted which appears to course to
 the mediastinum; distal aspect obscured by overlying pacer lead.
