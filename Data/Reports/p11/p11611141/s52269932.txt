                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lateral view is
 markedly limited due to the patient's arm overlying the field of view.  On the
 frontal radiograph, the lung volumes are low which also limits the evaluation,
 though allowing for this, there is no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal
 contour appear normal.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications along the
 aortic knob.  The imaged bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
