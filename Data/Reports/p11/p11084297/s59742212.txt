                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, as before.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal
 size.  There is moderate unfolding of thoracic aorta with calcifications seen
 particularly along the arch.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe is not significantly
 changed and suggests scarring, predominantly in the right lower lobe. 
 Hemidiaphragms appear flattened.  Slight degenerative changes are similar
 along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
