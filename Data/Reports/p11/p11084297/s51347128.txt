                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubation, fall, vomiting, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Three AP views of the chest were provided.  Initially, the
 endotracheal tube was positioned at the carina.  The endotracheal tube was
 subsequently retracted with its final position at approximately 2.3 cm above
 the carina.  The NG tube is seen extending into the left upper abdomen. 
 Dual-lead pacer is positioned with its leads in the expected position of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Perihilar opacity is noted, likely
 aspiration or atelectasis. There is no supine evidence for pneumothorax or
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  No
 acute bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and nasogastric tubes with
 aspiration/atelectasis better assessed on subsequent CT chest.
