                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Post-radiation fibrosis is again demonstrated in the lung apices
 with associated bilateral upward retraction of the hila and left apical
 pleural thickening.  Proximal thoracic esophagus remains mildly dilated. 
 Trachea is slightly shifted towards the right above the thoracic inlet level
 without change.  Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise within normal
 limits.  No new areas of consolidation are present in either lung, and there
 are no pleural effusions.  Ununited fracture and sclerosis of right clavicle
 appear unchanged.  Surgical clips overly the left lingular area and may be
 related to prior wedge resections.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Post-radiation fibrosis in the lung apices, accompanied by left apical
 pleural thickening.
