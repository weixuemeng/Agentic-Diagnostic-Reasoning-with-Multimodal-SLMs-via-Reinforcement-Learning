                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with chest pain with history of pericardial
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___ and clavicle radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again fibrotic changes are visualized at the lung apices,
 consistent with patient's history of radiation therapy.  Previously visualized
 left upper lobe nodule is not clearly visualized on today's study and better
 evaluated on dedicated torso CT from ___.  Post-surgical changes
 are visualized in the left hemithorax.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no
 evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Known right clavicular fracture is again noted. 
 Otherwise, no acute fractures are identified.  Post-surgical changes are
 visualized in the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
