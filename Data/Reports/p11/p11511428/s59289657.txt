  1. Appropriately positioned right IJ central venous catheter.
  2. Recommend advancement of endotracheal tube by at least 4 cm.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 3:44 PM
  1. Newly placed right internal jugular venous tip catheter projects over the
  expected region of the mid-upper SVC.  No evidence of complication.
  
  2. Again, the ETT is too high.  Recommend advancing at least 4 cm to ensure
  that it is in the appropriate position.
  
  3. Bilateral confluent air space opacities predominantly in the lower
  hemithoraces, could be seen with pneumonia and/or aspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest Radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis, status-post central venous line
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semiupright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, earlier on the same day at
 1337h.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed right internal jugular venous catheter tip projects over the
 expected region of the mid-upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is
 not widened.  NG tube tip not well visualized.  The ETT tip remains
 approximately 8 cm from the carina with the neck in neutral or extended
 position, too high in the airway.  Bilateral confluent airspace opacities
 predominantly involving the lower hemithorax with relative sparing of the lung
 apices persists, unchanged.  The heart is normal in size.  No large pleural
 effusions.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned right IJ central venous catheter.
 2.  Recommend advancement of endotracheal tube by at least 4 cm.
 3.  Pulmonary opacities unchanged remain concerning for pneumonia/aspiration.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Advance the ETT approximately 4 cm as it is too high.
