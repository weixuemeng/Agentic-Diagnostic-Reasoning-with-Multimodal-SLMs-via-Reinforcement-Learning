                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with pneumonia s/p intubation // eval ETT s/p transfer
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen
 positioned approximately 7 cm above the carina.  Advancement by at least 3 cm
 would result in more optimal positioning.  An endogastric tube is also seen
 extending into the left upper abdomen with its tip excluded from view. 
 Extensive bilateral patchy airspace consolidation is noted involving the
 bilateral mid and lower lungs with relative sparing of the apices.  Findings
 may reflect severe pneumonia versus extensive aspiration.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. High riding endotracheal tube.  Advancement is recommended.
 2. Appropriately positioned endogastric tube.
 3. Extensive patchy consolidation within both lungs concerning for
 pneumonia/aspiration.
