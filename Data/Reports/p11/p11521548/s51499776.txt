                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pleurx catheter with malignant effusion, assess size,
 patient with history of lung cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the most
 recent study dated ___, there has been increase in the right pleural
 effusion despite the presence of a Pleurx catheter which projects over the
 right lower lung.  There is small amount of residual aeration in the right
 upper lobe.  There is an air-fluid level at the right lung apex which likely
 represents a small hydropneumothorax given findings on prior CT scan.  The
 heart size is difficult to assess.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion with small right apical
 hydropneumothorax.  Pleurx catheter appears to extend into the right lower
 chest.
