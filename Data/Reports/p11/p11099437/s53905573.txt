                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with COPD and new cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs demonstrate hyperinflated lungs and flattening
 of bilateral diaphragms consistent with patient's history of COPD.  Minimal
 nonspecific basilar scarring is unchanged since prior examinations.  Focal
 opacification within the right lower lobe partially obscures medial right
 hemidiaphram contour.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours otherwise unremarkable.  Small
 calcifications within the axilla and right supraclavicular region are similar
 to an oval-shaped right midlung opacification, unchanged when compared to
 prior examinations. This may represent a focal consolidation or be located
 externally on the skin.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possibly early right basilar pneumonia.  Recommend followup radiographs ___
 weeks post treatment.
