                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recurrent cough.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are hyperinflated. 
 The hemidiaphragms are flattened, this suggest but is not  definitive for the
 presence of COPD.  There are minimal reticular opacities in the lower lobe
 bilaterally grossly unchanged from ___.  This could be due to chronic
 interstitial abnormality related to COPD.  There is no evidence of pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
