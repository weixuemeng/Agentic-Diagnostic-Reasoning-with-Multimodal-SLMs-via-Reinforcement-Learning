 PA and lateral views of the chest shows increased lung volumes with flattening
 of the diaphragm and mild hyperlucency of the upper lobes compatible with
 stable COPD changes.  The right lung opacity has resolved.  Reticular changes
 at the lung bases are compatible with parenchymal scarring.  Stable oval shape
 right middle lung and axillary opacificaties are likely related to known
 neurocysticercosis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
