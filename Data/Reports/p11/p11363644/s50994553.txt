                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p L chest tube  // PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with interval
 decrease in left pleural effusion.  Lung volumes remain low and right base
 opacity persists but is less conspicuous.  There is subtle evidence of
 bilateral pulmonary pulmonary nodules/cavitary lesions, better assessed on
 prior CT.  Left base opacity may be due to combination of small pleural
 effusion, atelectasis and pneumonia.  The left hemidiaphragm may be mildly
 elevated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Interval decrease in left pleural effusion.  Persistent
 bibasilar opacities ; pulmonary nodules better assessed on CT.
