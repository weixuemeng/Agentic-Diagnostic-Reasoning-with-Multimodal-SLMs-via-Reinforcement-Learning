                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 intact. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Vague opacity overlies the left mid lung.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Vague opacity overlying the left mid lung may represent pneumonia in the
 correct clinical context but a mass lesion is not excluded. Follow up PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended and consider CT of the chest if the
 findings do not resolve.
