 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for
 low lung volumes.  The trachea is midline.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
