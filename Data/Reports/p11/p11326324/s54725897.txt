                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening balance, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  An AICD projects
 over the right chest wall with pacer lead extending into the right ventricle. 
 Abandoned left chest wall pacer leads are present extending into the right
 heart.  The lungs are hyperinflated reflecting known emphysema.  Mild
 reticulation of the lung markings could suggest a component of mild fibrosis. 
 There is blunting of the CP angles bilaterally likely indicative of bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There are no definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.  Midline sternotomy wires are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with emphysema and possible underlying
 chronic lung disease/fibrosis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions noted
 without definite signs of pneumonia.
