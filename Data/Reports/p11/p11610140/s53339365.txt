                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and hemoptysis.
 
 STUDY:  PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right PICC tip terminates in the mid to low SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs demonstrate
 diffuse ground-glass opacities, slightly worse the right than the left.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lung opacities, in the setting of hemoptysis are most compatible
 with pulmonary hemorrhage.
