 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach or below. 
 Bilateral widespread lung opacities, presumed to be alveolar hemorrhage are
 continuing to improve.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Right-sided PICC
 line ends at cavoatrial junction.  There is a right jugular sheath ending in
 upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral severe widespread lung opacities, presumed to be alveolar
 hemorrhage are continuing to improve.
 2.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
