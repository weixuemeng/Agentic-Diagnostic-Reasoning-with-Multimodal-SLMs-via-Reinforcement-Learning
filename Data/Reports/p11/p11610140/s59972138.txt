                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with alcoholic hepatitis and hypoxia, evaluate pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has slightly worsened since last exam.  There is also
 increased density at the right lung base which could represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, atelectasis or even early pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  Right-sided PICC
 line ends in lower SVC.  NG tube has been removed.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Worsening of mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  New right lower lung opacity could reflect either atelectasis, dependent
 edema, pleural effusion or even early pneumonia.  Re-evaluation is recommended
 after treatment for edema with repeat chest radiograph.  
 
 The results have been discussed with the medical team at 11:20 a.m.
