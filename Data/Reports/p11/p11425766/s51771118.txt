                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  The with seed cysts
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ams, hypoxia  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The right PICC
 line terminates in the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is improved.  An asymmetric subpleural opacity in the
 right upper lobe is less prominent today. The heart and mediastinum cannot be
 accurately assessed on this projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved pulmonary edema.
 
 Stable moderate pleural effusions with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 Asymmetric right upper lobe subpleural opacity but warrants re-evaluation with
 well positioned PA, lateral and apical lordotic radiographs, prior to
 discharge the to exclude active infection or malignancy.
