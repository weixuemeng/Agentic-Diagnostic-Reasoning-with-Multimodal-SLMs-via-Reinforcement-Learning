                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.  Chest tube
 pulled.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, the left chest tube has been retracted, though the
 tip overlies the base of the left lung.  A right-sided PICC line is present,
 tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are small right greater than left pleural effusions without gross
 change.  Again seen is right pleural thickening, right upper zone opacity, and
 distortion/retraction of the right hilum.
 
 Multiple small nodular densities at the lung apices could reflect pulmonary
 metastases in this patient with known pulmonary metastases.  Mild prominence
 of the left hilum is unchanged compared with ___ CT scan.  Mild
 asymmetric prominence of the left-sided vessels is noted, without overt CHF.
