                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath,
 chest pain, history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions, again seen to be partially loculated on the right.  There
 are also tracks of fluid along the right lung apex.  Patchy opacity in the
 left upper lung is again seen corresponding to that seen on prior chest CT
 with differential diagnosis at that time as including mycoplasma or viral
 infection.  Post-radiation changes of the right lung are again seen.  The
 paramediastinal left upper lung solid lesion is better appreciated and
 assessed on CT.  Known multiple pulmonary nodules are also better assessed on
 CT.  Known metastatic disease is better seen on CT.  The patient is status
 post vertebroplasty at two levels.  There is also stable moderate-to-severe
 compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body with adjacent sclerosis seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  In comparison with recent prior CT of ___, and in
 comparison with scout image, appearance of the chest is similar aside from
 possible new left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis versus mild
 consolidation at the left lung base, which may be new.
