 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 reduction in the degree of pleural effusion on the right.  Nevertheless, some
 effusion persists, especially in the apical cap region.  Some decrease of
 effusion is also seen on the left.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Asymmetric opacification is again seen in the left mid zone.  The multiple
 nodules and post-radiation changes are better seen on the prior chest CT.
