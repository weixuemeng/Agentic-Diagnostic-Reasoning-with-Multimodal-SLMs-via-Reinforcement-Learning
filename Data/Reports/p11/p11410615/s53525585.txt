                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions status post right thoracentesis and
 retraction of left chest tube.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:54 p.m., I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is a right PICC line over the mid SVC and a chest tube at the left
 chest base.  Possible slight interval change in alignment of the left chest
 tube, though the overall appearance is quite similar.  The possibility of a
 very tiny left apical pneumothorax medially cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Bilateral right greater than left effusions appear unchanged.  Right-sided
 volume loss, with right apical opacity, rightward tracheal retraction, and
 spiculated density in the right suprahilar region, again noted, unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged compared with ___.  Possible slight
 retraction of left chest tube.  Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, a tiny
 left apical pneumothorax.
