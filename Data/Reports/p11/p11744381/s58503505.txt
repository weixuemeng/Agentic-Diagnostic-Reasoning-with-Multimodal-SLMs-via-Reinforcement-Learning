                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever on immunosuppression, decreased PO
 intake, nonverbal.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged,
 similar to the prior study.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is crowding of bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be fully excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
