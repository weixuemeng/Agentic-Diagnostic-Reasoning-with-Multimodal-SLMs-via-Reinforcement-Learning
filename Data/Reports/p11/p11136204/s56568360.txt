                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p pacemaker placement 3d ago, on xarelto, fell forward
 today onto his face. Please evaluate for bleed/CT spine injury/normal
 positioning of pacemaker leads  // ___M s/p pacemaker placement 3d ago, on

 injury/normal positioning of pacemaker leads
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right ventricle and very proximal right atrium.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles
 which may be due to minimal atelectasis versus very trace pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right ventricle and very proximal right atrium.  Atrial lead
 may be slightly proximal in position.
 
 Slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to minimal
 atelectasis versus trace pleural effusions.
