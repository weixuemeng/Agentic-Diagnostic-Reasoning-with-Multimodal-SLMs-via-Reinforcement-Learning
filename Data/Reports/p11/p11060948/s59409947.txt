 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam
 from ___ and CT abdomen performed ___.
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity particularly to the right of midline is
 compatible with large hiatal hernia.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of
 confluent consolidation.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles is
 compatible with tiny bilateral effusions.  There is no confluent
 consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.  Median
 sternotomy wires again noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation with tiny bilateral pleural effusions without
 other acute cardiopulmonary process.
