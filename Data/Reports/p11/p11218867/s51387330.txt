                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Widened mediastinum is unchanged.  Small left
 pneumothorax is stable.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, are unchanged.  They are likely
 atelectases, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded .
