  1.  Mild vascular congestion with trace right pleural effusion.
  2.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm may be related to diaphragmatic
  eventration, diaphragmatic paralysis or in the setting of trauma diaphragmatic
  rupture.
  3.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea on exertion.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis.  There is elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  Apparent mild cephalization is accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  Trace right pleural effusion is present.  No left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for thoracolumbar
 degenerative changes with anterior osteophytes and endplate sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Trace right pleural effusion.
 2.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm may be related to diaphragmatic
 eventration, or diaphragmatic paralysis.
 3.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
