                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis with hypotension.  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Right-sided PICC tip is in the lower
 SVC.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci represents a combination of scarring
 and pleural thickening.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated and focality of
 interstitial edema in the left lower lung probably reflects severe emphysema
 elsewhere in the lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Tracheostomy cuff appears hyperinflated and distends the tracheal wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interstitial edema in the left lower lung, but no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.
 2.  Tracheostomy cuff appears hyperinflated.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 10:48
 a.m. on ___.
