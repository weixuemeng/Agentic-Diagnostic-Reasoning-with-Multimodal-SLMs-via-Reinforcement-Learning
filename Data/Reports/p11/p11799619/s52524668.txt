                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study including ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are hyperinflated,
 the upper lobes are hyperlucent suggesting the presence of emphysema.  Right
 lower lobe pneumonia has resolved.  Remaining linear opacities could be due to
 atelectasis or scarring.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has markedly improved. 
 There are no new lung opacities, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine and almost resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  In the right lower lobe at the periphery, linear opacities could
 be due to scarring or atelectasis. Hyperinflated lungs and hyperlucency in the
 upper lobes suggest the presence emphysema.  There are moderate degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
