                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there still is evidence of
 a right basal opacity that could represent chronic or slowly healing
 pneumonia.  The parenchymal changes are minimally denser than at the last
 examination.  Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged.  Moderate
 overinflation and hyperlucent lung apices, indicative of pulmonary emphysema. 
 No new parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette
 without evidence of pulmonary edema.
