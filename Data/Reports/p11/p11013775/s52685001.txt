                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at
 the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, and there is diffuse
 parenchymal opacification in the right lung, as well as patchy opacity in the
 left lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse parenchymal opacity in the right lung and patchy left basilar opacity
 along with vascular indistinctness, findings suggestive of asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  Multifocal infection, however, is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  Consider follow up radiographs after diuresis for
 further assessment.
