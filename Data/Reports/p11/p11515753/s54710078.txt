                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with diffuse axonal
 hemorrhage.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier as well as several prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 The left lung is grossly unremarkable within the limitations of the study
 technique although several pulmonary nodules are suspected and should be
 further evaluated with dedicated cross-sectional imaging since on the prior CT
 torso from ___, the entire left lung was collapsed due to large
 amount of pleural effusion.  On the right, there is slight improvement since
 yesterday of the extensive consolidation, but with still present multifocal
 nodular opacities, although overall the extent of the consolidation appears to
 be gradually improving.
 
 The ET tube tip is 2 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. 
 Continued surveillance with radiographs is recommended.
