                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:17 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  New OG tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 8:28 a.m.:
 
 Nasogastric tube passes into the upper stomach and out of view.  With the chin
 down, the ET tube ending no less than 2.5 cm from the carina is standard
 placement.  Right jugular introducer ends in the upper SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 ends in the region of the pylorus.
 
 Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation, worse in the right lung, has not
 improved.  The lung volumes are slightly better.  At least small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present, increased on the left since the earlier
 examination.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal veins are dilated.
 
 I would have urged an upright chest radiograph to exclude the possibility of
 an anteriorly collected pneumothorax in the supine patient, but chest
 radiograph performed ___, 2:24 a.m., available at the time of this
 review, was performed with the patient in semi-erect and showed left
 pneumothorax is unlikely.
