                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___ and CT of the chest
 dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is persistent atelectasis at the
 right base.  There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with some adjacent
 atelectasis.  There is relative increased elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with perihepatic ascites noted on recent CT of the
 chest.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Right basilar
 atelectasis.
