 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:12 PM
  Endotracheal tube terminates 6 centimeters above the carina.  There is
  redemonstration of known pneumoperitoneum which appears somewhat increased in
  size although this may relate to patient's position.  Left-sided pleural
  effusion and retrocardiac opacity remain unchanged.  The remaining monitoring
  and supporting devices are unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 17:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post reintubation, assess
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:22.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 17:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Left
 subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC unchanged.  Interval
 removal of right internal jugular central line.  There is pneumoperitoneum,
 which appears to be slightly more prominent compared to the prior study, but
 may be related to differences in positioning.  Clinical correlation, however,
 is advised.  There is a layering left effusion with a pleural catheter
 remaining in place and persistent consolidation, suggestive of lower lobe
 atelectasis, though pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated. 
 Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.
