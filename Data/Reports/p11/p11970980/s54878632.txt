 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Redo sternotomy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged, with the exception of a new right central venous access
 line.  The patient is rotated on today's image, so that the correct position
 of the line is difficult to determine.  Low lung volumes persist.  Status post
 CABG and sternotomy.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate right pleural effusion with
 subsequent areas of atelectasis.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No new
 focal parenchymal opacities are visualized.
