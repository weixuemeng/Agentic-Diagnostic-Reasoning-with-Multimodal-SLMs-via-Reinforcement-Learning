                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post cardiac surgery (VSD repair after MI,
 now presenting with increased work of breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 2.1
 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasoenteric catheter courses below the
 diaphragm, and is at least within the stomach, though the tip is incompletely
 imaged.  The tip of a right PICC remains too low at the level of the right
 atrium, proximal repositioning is again recommended.  There has been interval
 removal of a right internal jugular catheter.  Left lower lobe collapse is
 unchanged from prior examination.  A moderate right pleural effusion appears
 stable.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, without overt
 interstitial edema, unchanged from prior.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC at the level of the right atrium.  Proximal repositioning is
 recommended.
 2.  Standard position of all other support devices.
 3.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse.
 4.  Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion with central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___
 at 9:47 time on ___  via telephone, 5 minutes after discovery.
