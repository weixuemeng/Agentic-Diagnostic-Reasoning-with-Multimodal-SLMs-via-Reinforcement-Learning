                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  The tip of a new left PICC is oriented
 superiorly, terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein.  Tracheostomy and
 right sided central venous catheter are stable.  Mediastinal clips and
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Left lower lobe collapse persists.  Right pleural effusion slightly increased
 with adjacent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left PICC terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein.  Subsequent
 radiographs demonstrate proper position of the PICC.
 2.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse.  
 3.  Slightly enlarged right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
