                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post VSD repair and CABG and bilateral chest tube removals.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest tubes have been removed from each hemithorax.  Lines, tubes
 and drains appear otherwise unchanged.  There is a new moderate pneumothorax
 on the right.  The pleural edge is retracted from the chest wall by about 3.5
 cm.  There was already mild shift of mediastinal structures to the left
 associated with volume loss, probably related to retrocardiac opacification
 suggesting substantial left lower lobe atelectasis, but the degree of shift is
 unchanged.  There is a small pneumothorax on the left, probably unchanged. 
 Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post chest tube removal with a new moderate-sized
 pneumothorax on the right and unchanged small left-sided pneumothorax. 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone.
