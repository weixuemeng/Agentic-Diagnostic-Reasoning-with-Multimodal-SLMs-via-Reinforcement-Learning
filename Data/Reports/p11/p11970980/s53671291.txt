  The left heart border is not seen, presumably due to basilar atelectasis and
  left pleural effusion, which is stable compared to the prior study, however an
  underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded.  There is no
  overt pulmonary edema.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of STEMI, chronic heart failure, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The low lung volumes continue to be low.  Status post CABG with
 unremarkable alignment of the sternal wires.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 and bilateral areas of atelectasis, but no new parenchymal opacities
 suggestive of pneumonia.  Minimal fluid overload is present in unchanged
 manner.
