                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  tracheostomy tube with left chest tube, empyema with recent
 open VSD repair, assess for pneumonia, empyema and PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are noted.  A chest tube at the left lung base is again
 noted.  A left upper extremity access PICC line is seen with its tip in the
 region of the SVC, though tip is poorly visualized due to slight patient
 rotation.  Tracheostomy tube projects over the mediastinum.  Retrocardiac
 opacity at the left lung base is compatible with effusion and consolidation. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion also noted with probable mild
 compressive right lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild edema is also likely present
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart size cannot be assessed. 
 No large pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and lower
 lobe consolidations, left greater than right.
