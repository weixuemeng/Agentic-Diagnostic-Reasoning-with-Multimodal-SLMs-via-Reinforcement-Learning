                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory distress status post aspiration event with left
 lung exam worsened.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, there is no interval
 change in the appearance of the chest with a stable large right pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis, multifocal consolidations in the right
 upper, left upper and left lower lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 size cannot be evaluated.  Cardiomediastinum is unchanged, shifted towards the
 left.  Tracheostomy tube in standard position.  Left PICC tip in the mid SVC.
