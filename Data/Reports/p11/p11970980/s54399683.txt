                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after VSD repair with
 pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 The feeding tube tip cannot be clearly seen on the current study, most likely
 in the stomach.  The right PICC line tip is at the mid SVC.  Since the most
 recent prior radiograph, there is no substantial change in bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasal atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
