                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ST elevation MI after
 right coronary artery stenting.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 There is elevation of right hemidiaphragm, chronicity unknown.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess, most likely at least mildly enlarged.  Intra-aortic
 balloon pump is noted with its tip being approximately 4 cm below the roof of
 the aortic arch.  Left perihilar opacity is demonstrated and might reflect
 either asymmetric pulmonary edema or infectious process.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
