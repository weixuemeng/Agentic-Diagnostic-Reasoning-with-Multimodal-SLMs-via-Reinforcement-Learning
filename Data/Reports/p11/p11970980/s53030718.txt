 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified on the current study.  Right internal jugular central line
 continues to have its tip at the cavoatrial junction or possibly within the
 proximal right atrium.  Lung volumes remain low and there are layering
 bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities which may represent
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There continues to be mild perihilar edema, although there has been interval
 improvement since the prior study.  There has been prior median sternotomy. 
 The heart is stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
