                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:45 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  PEG placement and VSD repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse are unchanged.  New
 pneumoperitoneum presumably reflects the percutaneous gastrostomy tube
 described.  Right lung is grossly clear.  Heart is partially obscured by the
 ample left pleural effusion but probably normal and unchanged.  ET tube and
 right internal jugular line are in standard placements.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema in the right chest wall is decreasing.
