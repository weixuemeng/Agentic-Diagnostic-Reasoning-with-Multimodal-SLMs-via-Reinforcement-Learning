                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, assess for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate right-sided PICC
 line terminating in the distal SVC.  Patient is status post sternotomy with
 sternotomy sutures midline and intact.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Low lung volumes identified bilaterally with a stable
 retrocardiac opacification and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, likely
 a combination of atelectasis and a moderate left pleural effusion.  Trace
 right pleural effusion also noted.  Degenerative changes present at the
 bilateral acromioclavicular joints.  Anterior osteophyte formation noted
 throughout the thoracic spine.  Vertebral body heights are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable examination with retrocardiac opacification likely
 reflecting combination of atelectasis and moerate left effusion.  Trace right
 pleural effusion.
