                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___-year-old man with aspiration pneumonia, status post
 tracheostomy, empyema status post chest tube placement, now back on
 ventilation for a large aspiration event, resulting in hypercarbic hypoxic
 respiratory failure.  Poor aeration in the left chest on auscultation.  Assess
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 8:18 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable single-view chest x-ray shows moderate lung volume with
 interval improvement of right lung base ventilation for reduced pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, now small.  Left lung base is still opacified, due
 to left lower lobe collapse. Left chest tube is unchanged. Heart size is
 mildly enlarged in patient who has had median sternotomy for cardiac surgery. 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. There is no pneumothorax.
