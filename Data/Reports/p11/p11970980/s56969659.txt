                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 9:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, evaluate left effusion.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 8:36.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest from ___ at 9:22 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No interval change in appearance of the chest, with near-complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax, most likely reflecting lobar collapse
 with minimal aeration at the left apex with reaccumulation of left pleural
 effusion or hemorrhage or lung collapse due to mucus plugging.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Right lung remains clear.  There has been a median
 sternotomy for CABG, although cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be
 assessed given that they are obscured by the left opacity.  The right internal
 jugular central line, left subclavian PICC line, left basilar pigtail pleural
 catheter, and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
