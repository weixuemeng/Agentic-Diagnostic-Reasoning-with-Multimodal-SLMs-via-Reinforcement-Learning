                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new dual chamber ppm  // assess lead
 position      assess lead position
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:37 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A dual lead left-sided pacer is in place with the leads terminating over the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged which most likely reflects cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 suggesting underlying emphysema.  Blunting of both posterior costophrenic
 angles likely reflects small effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
