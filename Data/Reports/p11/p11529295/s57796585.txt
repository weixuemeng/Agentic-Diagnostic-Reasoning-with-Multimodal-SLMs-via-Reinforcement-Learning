                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cardiac arrest  // eval position of ET
 tube      eval position of ET tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 7 cm
 above the carina.  Cardiac silhouette is less prominent. Indistinctness of
 engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure. Poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm suggests small effusion
 and atelectatic changes.
