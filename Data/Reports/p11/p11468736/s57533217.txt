 courses into the left upper quadrant.  A right IJ central venous catheter is
 unchanged with its tip in the low SVC.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 Scattered perihilar opacities which could represent atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.  Air bronchograms in the retrocardiac space also noted. Tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There is no pneumothorax. Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes positioned appropriately.  Scattered opacities
