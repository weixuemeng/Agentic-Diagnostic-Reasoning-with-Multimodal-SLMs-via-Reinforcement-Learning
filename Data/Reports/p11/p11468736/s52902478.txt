                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic shock with rising white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Central catheter and nasogastric tube are unchanged.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the
 bases again is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower
 lungs.
