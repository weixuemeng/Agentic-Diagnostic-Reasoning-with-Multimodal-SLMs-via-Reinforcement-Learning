                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:26 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved,
 but severe bibasilar atelectasis has not.  There may be small-to-moderate
 accompanying bilateral pleural effusions, not appreciably changed over the
 past several days.  Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is top
 normal.  Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
 mid portion of the stomach moderately distended with air and fluid, but not
 nearly as dilated as it has been recently.  No pneumothorax.
