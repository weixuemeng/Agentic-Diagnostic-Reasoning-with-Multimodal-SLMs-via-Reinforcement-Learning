                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and fever x 4 days, bilateral
 crackles. H/o interstitial lung disease.  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___
 CT chest without contrast from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral interstitial lung disease with honeycombing likely represents
 progression of underlying disease.  No evidence of superimposed pneumonia. 
 Given preservation of lung volumes and that the progression of interstitial
 fibrosis is mild on chest radiographs, this is compatible with a fibrotic form
 of NSIP rather than UIP.  The heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild progression of interstitial fibrotic disease with honeycombing.  No
 evidence of superimposed pneumonia.  Given preservation of lung volumes and
 that the progression of interstitial fibrosis is mild on chest radiographs,
 this is compatible with a fibrotic form of NSIP rather than UIP.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___,
 assistant to NP. ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 2:45 PM, 15 minutes
