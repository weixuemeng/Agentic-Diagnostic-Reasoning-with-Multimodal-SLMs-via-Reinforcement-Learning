                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total
 of three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, the lungs are hyperinflated with coarsened interstitial
 pattern, most consistent with COPD.  There is an opacity at the right base,
 which is mostly linear.  Additionally, there are some unchanged calcifications
 at the left base, which likely represent costochondral cartilage.  The apices
 of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous and unfolded, unchanged from the prior
 exam.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged findings consistent with COPD.
 
 2.  Linear opacity at the right base is likely atelectasis.  In the proper
 clinical setting, developing pneumonia cannot be completely excluded, however.
