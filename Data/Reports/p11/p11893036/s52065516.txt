                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness, known lung cancer.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There are no focal consolidations, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Subtle prominence of the right pulmonary hilum
 reflects known mass.  A subtle perihilar nodular opacity projecting over the
 right mid to lower lung may reflect spread of tumor, as seen on the prior
 PET-CT.  The cardiac silhouette is laterally enlarged, which is unchanged. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  There is a chronic deformity of the distal left
 clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hilar mass without convincing evidence for a superimposed pneumonia.
