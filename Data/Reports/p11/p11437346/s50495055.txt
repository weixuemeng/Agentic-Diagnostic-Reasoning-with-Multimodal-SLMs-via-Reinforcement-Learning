 Does she have a pna vs atelectasis?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, possibly with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion

 it would be difficult to completely exclude superimposed pneumonia.  Central
 catheter remains in good position.
 
 There is a need drain again in the left upper quadrant with continued
 displacement of the stomach and colon to the right, consistent with the
 enlargement of the spleen.
