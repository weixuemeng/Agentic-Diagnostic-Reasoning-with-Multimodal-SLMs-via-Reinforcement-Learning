  A left-sided chest tube terminates over the left hemi thorax. A right-sided
  PICC is stable in position.
  
  Opacification of the left hemi thorax is again demonstrated, however
  opacification within the mid and upper lung on the left is more homogeneous,
  suggesting layering pleural fluid. Persistent opacity at the left base likely
  represents a combination of fluid and adjacent compressive atelectasis. No
  pneumothorax.

 today, now with decreased BS left side, new ct placed left side  // please
 evaluate for interval change
