 Compared to the prior study, the ET tubes/ catheters at the left lung base are
 similar in appearance and there is continued diffuse opacity through the left
 lung. The left chest tube is slightly less curved on this examination. Opacity
 at the left base, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation and probable component of left pleural effusion is also
 unchanged. Triangular opacity in the right mid zone laterally is essentially
 unchanged, as well. Left subclavian PICC line, with tip over distal SVC, again
 noted. No pneumothorax detected.
