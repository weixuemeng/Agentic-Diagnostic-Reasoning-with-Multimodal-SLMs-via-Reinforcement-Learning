                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new drain placed on L  // please confirm L
 drain placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, targeted review of chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, a pigtail catheter has been placed at the
 left lung base, in addition to the pre-existing left base chest tube. Diffuse
 opacity of the left lung has increased in density -- question due to increased
 layering fluid in (both views are supposedly upright) versus an additional
 superimposed process. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and
 blunting of left costophrenic angle are again seen. Previously seen small left
 base hydro pneumothorax is not appreciated at present. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 There is patchy opacity in the right upper zone, including in triangular
 opacity which appears to lie immediately above the expected location of the
 minor fissure,, with suggestion of slight upward bowing of the minor fissure.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for
 differences in positioning and remains grossly midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of left pigtail catheter. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Interval increase in degree of opacity diffusely in the left lung. Question
 increased pleura effusion versus superimposed process, such as asymmetric CHF.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
 4. New predominately triangular opacity in the right upper zone. There is
 slight upward bowing of the minor fissure and this likely represents
 atelectasis.
