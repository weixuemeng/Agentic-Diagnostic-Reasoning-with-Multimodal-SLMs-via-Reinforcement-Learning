                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7.5 cm above the carina and
 could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.  Left subclavian vascular
 catheter continues to terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein near the
 midline.  Worsening opacity within the left lower lung has fluctuated over
 recent radiographs and could potentially be due to recurrent aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Mild interstitial edema is present as well as
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
