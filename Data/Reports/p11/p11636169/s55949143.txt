 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly has improved since ___, but there is new

 for pneumonia particularly aspiration.  Lesser degree of atelectasis is new at
 the right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are small
 if any.  Upper mediastinum is not widened.  ET tube is in standard placement. 
 Left subclavian line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein, and a nasogastric
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  The fracture of the second from
