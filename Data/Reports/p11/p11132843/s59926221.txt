                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer.  Elevated left
 hemidiaphragm on ___ chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is due to atelectasis in the
 adjacent lower lobe that developed between ___ and ___.  As discussed with the referring physician, chest radiographs of a
 recent admission for purported pneumonia should be obtained to see if this
 could be healing.  Followup chest radiographs would then be indicated to
 document clearing.  Otherwise, chest CT scan would be indicated to look for a
 small endobronchial lesion or even aspirated foreign body responsible for
 continued atelectasis.  Left pleural effusion is small if any.  Right lung and
 left upper lung are entirely clear.  Heart size is normal.  Left subclavian
 infusion port ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
