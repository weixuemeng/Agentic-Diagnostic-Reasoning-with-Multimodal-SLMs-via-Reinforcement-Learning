 INDICATION:  Left chest tube pulled back, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.

 Subcutaneous air is seen along the left chest wall and beneath the pectoralis

 The endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 courses to the level of the GE junction could be safely advanced 10 cm for
 positioning within the stomach.  Bilateral dense consolidations are consistent
 with aspiration.
 
 A subacute left proximal humeral fracture and multiple chronic appearing rib
 fractures are again noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
