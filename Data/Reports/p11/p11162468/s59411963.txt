                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Malaise, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Left-sided
 pacer device with leads unchanged in position.  There is a large-bore
 right-sided catheter unchanged in position, terminating in the right atrium. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Subtle streaky opacity in the left retrocardiac region
 is again seen, although less confluent as compared to the prior study and may
 represent an underlying scarring.  PA and lateral views may be helpful for
 further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity appears somewhat improved
 compared to the prior study and most likely represents atelectasis/scarring. 
 PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.  Otherwise, no
 significant interval change.
