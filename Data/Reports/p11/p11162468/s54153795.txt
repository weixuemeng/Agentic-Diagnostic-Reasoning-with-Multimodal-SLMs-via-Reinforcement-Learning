 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with necrotic toe, preoperative chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Again seen are small bibasilar effusions which have
 decreased in size compared to prior.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity may
 represent a superimposed consolidation.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear and
 there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable.  Coronary stents are identified.  Triple-lead pacing device is again
 noted.  Right-sided central catheter is identified with distal tip in the
 right atrium.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval reduction in size of the bilateral effusions. 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia
 in the proper clinical setting.
