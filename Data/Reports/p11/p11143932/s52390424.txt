                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with CAD, admitted with chest pain and rising
 white count.?  pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is likely due to low lung volumes and AP technique. 
 Dual-lead pacemaker noted projecting over the left chest with leads
 appropriately placed.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is improved.  There is increased hazy opacification overlying the
 cardiac shadow to the left of the sternum and overlying the spine on the
 lateral view. This reflects consolidation in the posterior aspect of the left
 lower lobe and  in the appropriate clinical context, is consistent with
 pneumonia. Right lung is clear. No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hazy opacification in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe is
 consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 2.  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion.
