 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is severely rotated to the right, leading to unfolding of the
 mediastinum. Allowing for differences in patient positioning, there has been
 no significant change as compared to the prior examination. A dual lead
 pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively. The lung volumes remain low, resulting in the
 appearance of pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural
 effusion are present.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
