 Single portable frontal AP chest radiograph demonstrate intact median
 sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, pacemaker device projecting over the left
 upper thoracic cavity with intact leads within the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 Persistently low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis with slightly
 increased patchy opacity within the retrocardiac region. No additional focal
 opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and upper
 abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Markedly limited exam. Assessment for subtle abnormalities is limited.
 2.  Increased opacity within the retrocardiac region, likely representing
 atelectasis however cannot exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 3.  Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and moderate
 cardiomegaly.
