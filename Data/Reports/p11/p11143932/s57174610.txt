                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and cough; severe congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The patient is status post sternotomy. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged, although
 cardiac contours are not well delineated due to low lung volumes.  There are
 patchy basilar opacities, greater on the left than right, which obscure the
 left hemidiaphragm.  There is also mild perihilar fullness and opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Bibasilar opacities are nonspecific, particularly in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Atelectasis may explain the findings but other etiologies including
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful
 to delineate further, particularly if symptoms were to persist.
