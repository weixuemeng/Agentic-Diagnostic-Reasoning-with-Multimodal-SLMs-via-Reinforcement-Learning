                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent MI and sinus tachycardia,
 question pulmonary edema versus infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker remains in place with the leads terminating
 over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle,
 respectively.  This has been a prior median sternotomy for CABG with overall
 stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The pulmonary vascularity appears
 somewhat prominent, although certainly improved since the previous study of
 ___.  This likely reflects mild residual pulmonary edema.  No large
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.  No focal airspace consolidation
 is seen to suggest pneumonia.
