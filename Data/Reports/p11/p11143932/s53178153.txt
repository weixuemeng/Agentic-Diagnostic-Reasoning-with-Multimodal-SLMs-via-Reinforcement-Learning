                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single upright frontal view of the chest.  A pacer is seen overlying the left
 chest with intact leads in appropriate positions.  The lungs are low in
 volume. There is a patchy opacity at the left lung base suggestive of
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably
 enlarged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar patchy opacity most consistent with atelectasis. Clinical
 correlation is advised.
