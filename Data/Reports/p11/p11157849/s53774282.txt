                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for aspiration pneumonia in a patient with a history of a
 seizure now with cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe and mid lungs is
 consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  Minimal opacity in the right lower lung
 is consistent with atelectasis.  There are calcifications within the aorta;
 otherwise; the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine
 are unchanged.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacity in the left lower lobe and mid lung is consistent with
 aspiration pneumonia.
