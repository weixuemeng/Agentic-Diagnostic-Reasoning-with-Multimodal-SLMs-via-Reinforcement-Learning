 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Unremarkable appearance of
 thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present. 
 The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in apical
