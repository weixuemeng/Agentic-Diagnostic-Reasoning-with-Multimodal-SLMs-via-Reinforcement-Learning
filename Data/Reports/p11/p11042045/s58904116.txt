                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute pancreatitis.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac opacity with obscuring of the lateral
 border of the thoracic aorta on the frontal view and better seen on the
 lateral view with a spine sign may represent round atelectasis, although an
 acute process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  Linear
 plate-like band in the left lower lung is atelectasis. No pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity may reflect round atelectasis, however acute pneumonia
 cannot be excluded and recommend treatment with follow-up chest radiograph to
 ensure resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ ___ from the referring team on the telephone on ___ at 4:00 PM,
 after discovery of the findings.
