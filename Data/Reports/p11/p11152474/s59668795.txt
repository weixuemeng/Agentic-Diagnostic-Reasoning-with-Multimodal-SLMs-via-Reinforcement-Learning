                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with intracranial hemorrhage.  Acute desaturation to ___%.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Worsening of the bilateral widespread alveolar opacities with thickening of
 the right minor fissure and progressive bilateral pleural effusion with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  This is mostly compatible with severe pulmonary edema.
 A tracheostomy is in adequate position.  The right-sided PICC line is
 unchanged and ends in the mid-superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is a gastrostomy.  The mediastinal and cardiac contour are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is worsening of the now severe pulmonary edema.
