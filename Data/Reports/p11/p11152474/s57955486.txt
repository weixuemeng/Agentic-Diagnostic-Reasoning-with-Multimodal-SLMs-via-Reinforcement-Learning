 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the nasogastric
 tube that was newly placed is well visible in the middle parts of the stomach.
 As noted on the previous examination, there is extensive free intra-abdominal
 air after PICC tube placement.  The visible parts of the thorax look
 unchanged.
