                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right parieto-occipital hemorrhage followed
 by respiratory arrest, question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates an interval
 decrease in lung volume.  Confluent opacity at the left lung base remains,
 likely reflecting combination of left lower lobe collapse and effusion. 
 Elevation of the minor fissure indicated right upper lobe volume loss. A right
 pleural effusion is improving.  Mild pulmonary edema is improving.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, the mediastinal contours
 reflect central venous engorgement.
 
 The endotracheal tube is similar in position, and projects no less than 2.2 cm
 from the level of the carina.  A right upper extremity PICC tip projects in
 the lower SVC.  An NG tube tip projects at the level of the gastric antrum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased lung volumes, with improving mild pulmonary edema. Left
 lower lobar atelectasis and right upper lobe mild volume loss are similar.
