                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube is coiled in the stomach.  There is obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm laterally likely due to a combination of effusion and
 volume loss.  An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.  There are no old
 films available for comparison.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 redistribution and mild cardiomegaly.
