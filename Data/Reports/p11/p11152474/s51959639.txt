                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared to the prior
 study.  Lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the prior exam, and
 there has been improved aeration at both lung bases.  Residual opacities
 persist in the retrocardiac areas and probably represent atelectasis.  There
 are also small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving aeration at lung bases with residual retrocardiac
 opacities.  Small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
