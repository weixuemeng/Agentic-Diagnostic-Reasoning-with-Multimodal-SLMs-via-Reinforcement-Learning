                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette size remains borderline enlarged, and the
 aorta remains tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, with no focal consolidation
 present.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 Infection, however, is difficult to exclude.
