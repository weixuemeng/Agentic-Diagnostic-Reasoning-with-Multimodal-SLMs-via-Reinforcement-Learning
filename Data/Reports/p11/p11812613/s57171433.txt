                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with multifocal pneumonia on CT, chronic respirator due to
 laryngeal cancer, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT scan from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The previous right middle and right lower lobe consolidations are still
 present, but improved.  Left lung is essentially clear with a few linear
 streaks of atelectasis at the lung base.  No new area of consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend followup in four weeks
 to assess for complete resolution.
