                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea on exertion, coughing up blood. 
 Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy right mid-lung opacity silhouettes the right heart border,
 compatible with right middle lobe airspace infiltration.  No diffuse pulmonary
 abnormality is present.  The heart is of normal size.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe infiltrate, compatible with pneumonia, although
 other etiologies including hemorrhage could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Particularly given history of malignancy, follow-up
 radiograph is recommended to ensure resolution.
