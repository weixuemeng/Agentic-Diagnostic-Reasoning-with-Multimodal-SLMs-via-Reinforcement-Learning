                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of metastatic melanoma with
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new bibasilar opacities likely representing a combination
 of moderate right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with
 cephalization consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  Additionally,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aortic arch are present. No pneumothorax.
 
 Right upper lobe mass is again identified with fiducial seeds at the inferior
 border of this mass.  Previously noted ___ in the supraclavicular region
 have been removed, but soft tissue prominence persists in this region.  No
 acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left, and moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent compressive atelectasis.  However,
 infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
 3.  Similar appearance of right upper lobe mass containing fiducial markers
 inferiorly.
 4.  Surgical ___ overlying the region of known supraclavicular
 lymphadenopathy have since been removed.  Soft tissue prominence in this
 region persists.
