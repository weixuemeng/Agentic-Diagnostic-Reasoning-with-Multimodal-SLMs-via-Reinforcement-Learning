                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right apical chest wall mass appears similar to the recent CT scan
 and is associated with destructive changes in the right fourth rib.  Fiducial
 seeds are present in the inferior aspect of the mass.  Since the recent study,
 the patient has undergone a procedure in the left supraclavicular region with
 associated surgical clips, surgical drains and soft tissue density in this
 region, possibly reflecting post-operative swelling and/or hematoma.  Heart
 size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  New bibasilar opacities are present, and may reflect atelectasis
 and/or aspiration.  Small pleural effusions are also new.
