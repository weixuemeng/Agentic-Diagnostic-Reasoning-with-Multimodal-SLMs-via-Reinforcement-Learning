 AP CHEST 6:43 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, assess for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged but the lungs are clear and there is no vascular
 congestion, edema or evidence of pneumonia.  Pleural effusion if any is tiny
 on the left.
 
 Elliptical nodular opacity projecting over the lower pole of the right hilus
 could be a vessel on end or pulmonary calcification.  Conventional radiographs
 recommended for confirmation when feasible.
