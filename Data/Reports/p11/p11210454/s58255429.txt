                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aphasia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous and demonstrates diffuse calcifications.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Aspiration or infection cannot
 be fully excluded.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
