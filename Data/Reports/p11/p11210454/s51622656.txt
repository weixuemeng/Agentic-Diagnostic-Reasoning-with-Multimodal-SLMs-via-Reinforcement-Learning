                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OGT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there has been
 placement of an orogastric tube that can be followed to the upper stomach, but
 then becomes lost in the abdomen.  If there is concern as to the precise
 position of the tip and side hole, repeat study with abdominal technique would
 be helpful.
 
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
