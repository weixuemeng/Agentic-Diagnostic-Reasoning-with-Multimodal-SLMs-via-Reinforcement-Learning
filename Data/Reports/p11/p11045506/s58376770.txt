                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough and known history of asthma and
 sarcoidosis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and a chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Again seen are extensive pulmonary abnormalities including
 multifocal bronchiectasis and scarring predominantly in both upper lobes,
 similar in distribution to the CT of ___.  However, in the right upper
 lobe overlying the fissure, there is an area of increased opacity, compared to
 the earlier chest radiograph of ___, it is unclear if this represents
 worsening fibrosis or pneumonia superimposed on chronic lung changes.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes of pulmonary fibrosis due to underlying
 sarcoidosis.  Focal area of increased opacification in the right upper lobe
 compared to the earlier study of ___, could represent worsening fibrosis
 versus superimposed pneumonia.  Recommended followup chest radiographs after
 treatment to assess resolution.
