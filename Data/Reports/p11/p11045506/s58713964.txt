                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and cough, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph is provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse interstitial abnormality in the lungs, predominantly in the
 upper lobes as seen on prior CT chest, is consistent with fibrosis from known
 sarcoidosis.  Patchy opacity at the left base may represent soft tissue,
 however, can also be infection superimposed on chronic lung disease. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged given differences and
 technique.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality predominantly in the upper lung zones,
 consistent with known sarcoidosis.
 2.  Opacity at the left base may be superimposed infection.
