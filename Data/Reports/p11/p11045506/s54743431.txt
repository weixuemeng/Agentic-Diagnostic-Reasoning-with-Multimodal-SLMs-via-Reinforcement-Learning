                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low. The heart size remains mildly enlarged but
 unchanged. Mediastinal contour is similar. Bilateral hilar enlargement
 compatible with lymphadenopathy is again noted. Increased interstitial
 markings are noted diffusely, but more so within the upper lobes, and not
 substantially changed in the interval, likely reflective of patient's known
 sarcoidosis with fibrotic changes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly evident. There may be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
 compatible with underlying sarcoidosis with fibrotic changes. Mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement. No new focal consolidation.
