                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Coarse interstitial opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally are indicative of
 underlying fibrotic changes secondary to chronic sarcoid.  Comparing to prior
 studies there is no new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart size and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial changes in the upper lobes bilaterally compatible with
 chronic sarcoid, but no evidence of new consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
