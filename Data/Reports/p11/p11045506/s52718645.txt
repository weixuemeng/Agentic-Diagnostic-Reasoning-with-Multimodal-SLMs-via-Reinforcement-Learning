                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of asthma, COPD, presenting with shortness of breath and
 wheezing. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including the most recent from ___. CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is a diffuse interstitial abnormality most marked in the upper
 lobes with associated bronchiolectasis, similar to the prior exam, and
 compatible with the patient's history of sarcoidosis.  Enlargement of the
 hila, due to lymphadenopathy, is unchanged.  There is no focal opacity,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, and normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Unchanged interstitial abnormality and hilar
 lymphadenopathy, consistent with sarcoidosis.
