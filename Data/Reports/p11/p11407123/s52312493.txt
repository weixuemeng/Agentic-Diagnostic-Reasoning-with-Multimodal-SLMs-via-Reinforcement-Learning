                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 linear opacity projecting over either the right middle lobe or lingula on the
 lateral view is not well seen on the frontal view that may represent
 atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not excluded.  No focal
 consolidation is seen elsewhere.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. 
 The patient is rotated slightly to the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy mid lung opacity on the lateral view, not well seen
 on the frontal view may represent atelectasis, although an early infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
