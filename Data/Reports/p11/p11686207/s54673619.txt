                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, bronchitic sounding, 
 desaturation of oxygen while walking, evaluate for possible pneumonia prior to
 inhaled steroid use.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement and the thoracic
 aorta is generally widened and elongated.  Calcium deposits are seen in the
 wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates
 an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no sign of an advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema.  No evidence of acute infiltrates and the
 lateral pleural sinuses are free.  In the apical area, thickened pleural
 structures are noted bilaterally and combined with old scar formations and
 irregular densities in the peripheral portions of the parenchyma in this
 territory.  When comparison is made with the next previous examination of
 ___, these changes have not undergone any difference in
 appearance anf represent  old inactive specific scars.  Comparison
 demonstrates on the other hand that the cardiac size has increased mildly and
 so has the upper zone redistribution pattern.  Acute infiltrates are not
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Old stable, probably specific bilateral apical scar formations,
 moderate cardiac enlargement with mild degree of chronic CHF but no evidence
 of acute pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions.
