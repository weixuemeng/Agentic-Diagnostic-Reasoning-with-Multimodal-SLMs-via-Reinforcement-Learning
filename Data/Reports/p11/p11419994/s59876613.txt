                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers/cough  // eval for atelectasis vs
 blossoming PNA - please obtain XR on ___ in AM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Linear atelectasis in the bilateral mid lungs is
 unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis is increased.  Heart size is top-normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  An enteric tube
 terminates within the gastric body, but with a side port near the level of the
 GE junction.  Area of homogeneous increased opacity with straight, linear
 images projecting over the right lung is likely artifactual.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Enteric tube side port is near the level of the GE junction.  Recommend
 advancing by approximately 5 cm.
 3. Area of homogeneous increased opacity with straight, linear images
 projecting over the right lung is likely artifactual.  Recommend repeat
 radiograph.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Area of homogeneous increased opacity with straight,
 linear images projecting over the right lung is likely artifactual.  Recommend
 repeat radiograph.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ ___, N.P. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:06 AM, approximately
