 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 18:06.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:05.
 
 A portable AP upright chest from ___ at 18:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval appearance of a small left apical pneumothorax.  Right
 paramediastinal soft tissue opacity is stable and is consistent with the known
 juxtahilar mass seen on the recent CT of ___.  Linear opacities in the
 right upper lung likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusions.  Overall, cardiac contour is stable but upper limits of
 normal size given portable technique.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen
 involving the left lateral chest wall soft tissues.  Focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No large effusions.
