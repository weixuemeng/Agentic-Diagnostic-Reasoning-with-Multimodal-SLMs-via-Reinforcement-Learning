 COMPARISON:  None available. 
 
 Endotracheal tube is approximately 6 mm from the carina.  Right internal
 jugular catheter is visualized with the tip obscured by multiple overlying
 wires.  Lung volumes are low bilaterally and exaggerate pulmonary vascular
 markings.  There is prominence of bilateral hila but no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. Pacemaker
 is visualized in place and there may be a remnant right ventricular lead in
 place. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip is 0.6 cm from the carina.  Retraction is
 recommended.
