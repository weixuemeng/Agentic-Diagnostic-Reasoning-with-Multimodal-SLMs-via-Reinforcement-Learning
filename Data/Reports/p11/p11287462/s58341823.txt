                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach, however the side port lies proximal to
 the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by least 10 cm for
 optimal positioning.  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs with emphysematous changes in the upper lobes are
 again noted.  Lungs are clear however the extreme right lung apex is excluded
 from the field of view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Patient is status post gastric
 banding which has a somewhat different configuration compared to the prior
 chest radiograph, appearing circular, likely due to differences in patient
 positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Emphysema.
 2. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 3. Sub optimal positioning of the enteric tube with side-port proximal to the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by at least 10 cm.
 4. Gastric lap band has a different configuration compared to the previous
 radiograph which may be due to differences in patient positioning and exam
 technique.  Correlate clinically and consider upright view of the abdomen to
 confirm appropriate positioning of the lap band if needed.
