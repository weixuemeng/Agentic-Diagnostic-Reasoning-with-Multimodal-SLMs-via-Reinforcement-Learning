                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sepsis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 19:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip at the SVC/right atrial junction.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified on this supine exam.  Endotracheal tube remains in similar
 position.  As seen previously, the enteric tube should be advanced as this
 side port remains proximal to the gastroesophageal junction by at least 10 cm.
 Remainder of the examination is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the junction of the
 SVC and right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Endotracheal tube in unchanged position, however, the enteric tube side
 port remains proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced
 by at least 10 cm.
