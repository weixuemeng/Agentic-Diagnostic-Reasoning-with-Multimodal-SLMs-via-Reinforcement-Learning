                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 100PYH with complex PMHx including severe
 COPD, HTN, CAD (s/p stentsx4), stroke, s/p cholecystectomy, OSA on home CPAP,
 malignant melanoma (shoulder, s/p excision ___), bladder cancer (low grade,
 non-invasive), transferred from ___ for management of newly
 diagnosed presumed metastatic cholangiocarcinoma that presented w/ acute
 pancreatitis now improved w/ supportive care, now with leukocytosis and fever
 // evaluate for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The heart is of normal
 size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. The pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable. Subtle possible nodular opacities in the left and right lower
 lobe, not well seen on the lateral may reflect superimposition. No frank
 consolidation. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle possible nodular opacities in the left and right lower lobe, not well
 seen on the lateral may reflect superimposition. If clinical concern for
 pulmonary nodules is high, this should be correlated CT thorax as low
 sensitivity of radiographs.
