 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at
 the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm.  This is consistent with
 pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis in the left lower lung.  Little
 change in the monitoring and support devices, with the tip of the endotracheal
 tube approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  There is mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels that could reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
