                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and left hip fracture.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP supine view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Rounded
 retrocardiac density may be related to hiatal hernia; however, the evaluation
 is limited.  There is a moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis.  There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia. 
 Engorgement of the bronchovascular structures, particularly in the right hila
 are likely related to low lung volumes rather than frank edema, although given
 the patient's marked cardiomegaly, correlation with BNP if the patient has
 signs of heart failure would be helpful. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with crowding of the bronchovascular structures which may be
 related to low lung volumes versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 3.  Rounded retrocardiac density likely relates hiatal hernia.  Correlate on
 pending CT.
