 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The patient has been
 extubated, and there is resultant mild pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the
 right lower lobe with air bronchograms may be accounted for by pulmonary
 edema, but attention on followup after treatment is recommended. Enteric tube
 is in standard position.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild pulmonary edema with opacification of the right lower lobe which may also
 represent pulmonary edema or a developing pneumonia.
