                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Lung
 volumes are low which limits evaluation somewhat.  Allowing for this, there is
 no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A PICC line in the left
 arm extends to the level of the superior vena cava, in unchanged position.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Unchanged position of PICC line.
