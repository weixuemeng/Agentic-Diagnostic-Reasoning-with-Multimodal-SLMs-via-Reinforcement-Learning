                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with systolic heart failure, ejection fraction of
 15%, and history of coronary artery disease.  Presents with shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral low lung volumes with prominent pulmonary
 vasculature and interstitial markings most likely representing worsening
 pulmonary edema; however, atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded but is much
 less likely.  No areas of focal consolidation concerning for infection.  There
 is a small  right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable.  The heart is stably enlarged with the proximal
 electrode of a left-sided pacer device extending from the SVC into the low
 right atrium, unchanged in longstanding position.  The lead terminates at the
 apex of the right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires are again noted in
 alignment and with no evidence of failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with increased vascular prominence suggestive of
 worsening pulmonary edema.  Though much less likely, an atypical pneumonia
 cannot be excluded,
