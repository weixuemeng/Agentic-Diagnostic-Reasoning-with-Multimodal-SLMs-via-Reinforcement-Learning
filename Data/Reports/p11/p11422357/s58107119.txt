                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PMH of CHF with increasing SOB and fall with L
 knee pain  // ?CHF, as well as rib fracture and knee fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single lead left-sided AICD is seen with lead extending the expected location
 of the right ventricle.  Status post median sternotomy.  Increased
 interstitial markings again seen bilaterally consistent with chronic lung
 disease, although appear slightly more prominent compared to the prior study
 which may be due to component of superimposed pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
