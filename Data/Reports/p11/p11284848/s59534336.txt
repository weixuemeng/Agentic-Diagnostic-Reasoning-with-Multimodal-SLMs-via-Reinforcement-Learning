                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of the ___, the left chest tube
 has been removed.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There is now a relatively
 thick band of atelectasis in the left mid zone without evidence of
 consolidation.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is seen.
