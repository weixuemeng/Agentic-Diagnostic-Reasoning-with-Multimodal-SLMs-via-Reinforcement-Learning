                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lethargy, headache. Fall 1 week ago with head
 strike
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT abdomen
 pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures
 is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are seen in the
 lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Marked degenerative changes with
 diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is noted in the imaged thoracolumbar
 spine.  Additionally diffuse increased sclerosis of the vertebral bodies is
 unchanged compared to the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Diffuse increased
 sclerosis of multiple vertebral bodies within the imaged thoracolumbar spine,
 unchanged from the prior CT, and clinical correlation with any history of
 malignancy is recommended.
