                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diastolic disfunction s/p Ventral Hernia 
 repair with low oxygen saturation  // R/o pulmonary process     R/o pulmonary
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 18 58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.
 There is likely a small layering left effusion.  Given the low lung volumes,
 assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult. There is
 crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema
 appreciated. No pneumothorax.
