                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate lead placement and pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.  
 
 Left small pneumothorax has minimally increased.  Transvenous pacemaker leads
 terminate in the standard position in the right ventricle.  There are
 persistent low lung volumes.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  New
 left mid lung opacity is consistent with atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged with stable cardiomegaly.
