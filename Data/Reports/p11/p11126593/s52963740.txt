                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with atrial fibrillation status post fall
 with delirium.  Lung nodule seen on the AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nodular area of density seen on the prior radiograph is faintly
 visualized on today's study.  This may represent developing infiltrate versus
 a lung nodule.  CT scan for baseline assessment would be helpful.  The rest of
 the lung fields are grossly clear.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint density in the left mid lung zone, corresponding to the nodular density
 seen on the prior study.  This may represent developing infiltrate or a
 pulmonary nodule.  If there is high concern, a CT scan could be performed for
 further assessment.
