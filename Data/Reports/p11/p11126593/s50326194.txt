                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ? fluid overload  // evidence of fluid overload
 evidence of fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided single lead pacemaker with a right ventricular lead is in
 unchanged position. There is mild pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right worse than left. The heart is mildly enlarged. There
 is no pneumothorax. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 Vague opacity adjacent to the pacemaker mentioned on the prior chest
 radiograph is likely still present and somewhat obscured secondary to
 increased vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions.
 
 2. Vague opacity seen on prior chest radiograph is likely still present and
