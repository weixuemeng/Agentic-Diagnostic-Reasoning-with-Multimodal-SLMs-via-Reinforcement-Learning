 Single lead left-sided pacer is again seen with lead extending the expected
 position of the right ventricle, stable. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable. There are relatively low lung volumes. Patchy airspace
 opacity in the lateral left mid lung could be due to infection or pulmonary
 contusion. No overlying rib fracture is seen, although CT is more sensitive.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 Patchy airspace opacity(ies) projecting over the left mid lung may be due to
 infection/pneumonia however, pulmonary contusion not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
