                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple medical comorbidities with presenting with auditory
 hallucinations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 4.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A single-lead pacemaker device appears unchanged with its lead again
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including cardiomegaly.  Small
 pleural effusions are again suspected, but if anything, perhaps decreased. 
 Fissures remain mildly thickened, but less so. Pulmonary vasculature is
 prominent and hazy again suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
