                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever  // r/o PNA      r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably lower than on ___ exaggerating heart size
 which is borderline enlarged.  It also produces crowding and partial
 obscuration of pulmonary vasculature which is probably normal. The lungs are
 grossly clear, but subtle pulmonary abnormalities would not be appreciated.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs
 performed at full inspiration, to see if there is still a question about the
 pulmonary parenchyma which would warrant chest CT.
