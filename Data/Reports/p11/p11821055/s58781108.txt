                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed on the same date, ___, a proximal
 3 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine AP radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which appears to
 terminate 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube descends the
 thorax in an uncomplicated course, its tip projecting over the right upper
 quadrant in appropriate position. Relative to prior study, enteric tube has
 been advanced.  Subtle left perihilar and lower lobe opacity could reflect
 aspiration. There is no pleural effusion identified. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Supportive devices in appropriate position. No pneumothorax.  Possible
 aspiration in the left lower lung.
