                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in patient status
 post removal of foreign body (pieces of the patient's dentures) from airway
 with persistent airway edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in ___ PACS.  A radiologist report of a chest
 radiograph taken on ___ at___ was reviewed, but the
 images were not available for review.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect bedside AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The upper thoracic esophagus is dilated, and a 1-cm radiopaque
 structure can be seen overlying this location, which may represent an ingested
 foreign body.  Bilateral pulmonary edema and a right-sided pleural effusion
 are noted.  Heart size is normal.  There is asymmetric enlargement of the
 right hilum, for which a prior comparison is not available for review.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Atherosclerotic calcifications in the aortic arch are
 noted.  An IVC filter is in place.  S-shaped scoliosis of the spine spine as
 well as asymmetric degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are
 also evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Radiopaque structure overlying the upper dilated esophagus, of unclear
 etiology, but possibly representing persistent foreign body within the
 esophagus.
 2.  Pulmonary edema with right-sided pleural effusion.
 3.  Asymmetric enlargement of the right hilum for which comparison to prior
 chest radiograph is necessary to further evaluate.
 
 NOTE:  The possibility of persistent retained foreign body within the
 esophagus, as well as the necessity of obtaining prior radiographs to evaluate
 right hilar enlargement was discussed with Dr. ___ via telephone on
 ___ at ___:___. ___ MD
