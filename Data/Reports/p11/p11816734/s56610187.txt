 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with increased lethargy  // Eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation.  Allowing for this, on the
 frontal view, inspiratory volumes are low.  There is mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study.  There is bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is also atelectasis in the right middle lobe, slightly
 more pronounced than on ___.  No definite pneumonic infiltrate.  No
 frank consolidation.  No effusion identified.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, with mild vascular plethora, more pronounced than in ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis and atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  No frank
 consolidation.  However, the possibility of an early infectious infiltrate in
 the right middle lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
