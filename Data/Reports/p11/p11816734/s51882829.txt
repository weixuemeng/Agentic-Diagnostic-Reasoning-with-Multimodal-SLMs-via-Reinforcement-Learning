                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous and demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications.  Enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries is re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  Enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
