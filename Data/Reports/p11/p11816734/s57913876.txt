                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ as
 well a chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hyperglycemia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low, though there is no focal airspace consolidation to raise
 concern for pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There
 remains prominence of the right pulmonary hilum which given stability over
 multiple prior exams, likely reflect prominent vasculature.  Heart and
 mediastinal contour appear grossly within normal limits.  The bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable prominence of the right pulmonary hilus which given
 stability over time and prior characterization on CT chest, likely reflects
 vascular prominence, possibly in the setting of pulmonary hypertension.
