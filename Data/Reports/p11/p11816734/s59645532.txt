                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small focus of increased opacity in the the right lower lobe which
 could be representative of an early infection, possibly due to aspiration, or
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the remainder of the lungs are clear with no other
 consolidations, effusions, or pnemothoraces.  Bilateral hilar enlargement
 remains stable and suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Heart size is
 normal.  Aorta is stably tortuous.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small focus of increased opacity in the right lower lobe which may be
 representative of an early infectious process in the proper clinical setting.
