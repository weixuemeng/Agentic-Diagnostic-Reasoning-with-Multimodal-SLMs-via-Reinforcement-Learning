 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  There
 is interval development of diffuse increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally and prominence of the hila suggesting fluid overload, new since
 the prior study earlier today.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  A large bore catheter from an inferior approach is again seen
 unchanged in position terminating at the inferior cavoatrial junction/right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
 
 Interval development of increased interstitial markings bilaterally and slight
 increase in prominence of the hila suggest fluid overload.
