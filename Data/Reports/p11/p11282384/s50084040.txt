 HISTORY:  Productive cough for 5 days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged, with mild pulmonary edema  noted.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right are present, with bibasilar
 airspace opacities most pronounced in the retrocardiac region, possibly
 reflecting atelectasis.  Infection however is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Central venous catheter tip courses cephalad from the IVC, and
 terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
