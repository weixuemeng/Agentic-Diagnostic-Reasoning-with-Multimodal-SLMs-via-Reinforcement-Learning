                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower quadrant tenderness and shortness of breath.  Patient on
 dialysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  A dialysis catheter, entering via
 the inferior vena cava, terminates in the mid upper right atrium.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The minor fissure
 is somewhat more thickened, and increased interstitial abnormality and
 prominence of pulmonary vascularity suggests mild fluid overload.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No focal opacity indicates pneumonia.  A small pleural effusion
 is suspected on the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload.
