                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asthma exacerbation and fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  Haziness in the right infrahilar
 region is somewhat more prominent since the prior study.  No other focal
 airspace opacity is detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 prominence of predominantly large bowel in the upper abdomen, although this is
 nonspecific.
 
 IMPRESSION: Haziness in the right infrahilar region could reflect pneumonia.
