                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CML, to assess for pulmonary abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. 
 However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
 
 Of incidental note is an apparent coronary artery stent.
