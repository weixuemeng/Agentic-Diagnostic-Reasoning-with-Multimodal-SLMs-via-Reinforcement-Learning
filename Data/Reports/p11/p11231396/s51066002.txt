 over the past two weeks, accompanied by a very slight increase in interstitial
 abnormality in the right lower lung.  There is also a very tiny pleural
 effusion layering posteriorly in one or both sides of the chest.  The findings
 overall point to the very early stage of heart failure, but not pneumonia.
