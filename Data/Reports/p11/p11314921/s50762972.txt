                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is densely calcified.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes again noted.  A fiducial
 marker in the right upper lobe of the lung is in unchanged position.  10 mm
 nodule within the right juxta hilar region is unchanged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Marked narrowing of the right acromial humeral
 interval with sclerosis of the acromion and superior humeral head as well as
 superior subluxation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid is compatible
 with rotator cuff disease.  Moderate degenerative changes the right
 glenohumeral joint are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Unchanged right juxtahilar nodule and
 fiducial marker in the right upper lobe.  Emphysema.
