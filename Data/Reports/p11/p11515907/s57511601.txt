                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post trauma with left-sided
 small apical pneumothorax, now hypotensive, evaluate for interval change in
 pneumothorax or other acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Comparing the frontal views, the chest findings are
 grossly unaltered.  The on next previous examination diagnosed tiny remnant of
 pneumothorax in the left apical area is again observed and constitutes a
 linear density running parallel at 2 mm distance from the apical skeletal
 chest wall.  Review of chest CT of ___ and also old chest CT from
 ___ demonstrated that the patient had some old apical scar formations, which
 match the linear density.  A significant pneumothorax can be ruled out.  It
 can be stated, however, that there exists a mild blunting of the left
 posterior pleural sinus, indicative of a small pleural effusion.  This was
 also present on the preceding chest examination, lateral view.  On the chest
 examination of ___, the posterior pleural sinus was free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of remaining pneumothorax in apical area. 
 Development of small left-sided pleural effusion in posterior pleural sinus
 matching patient's trauma of nondisplaced left-sided lower rib fractures and
 multiple transverse process injuries as seen on chest CT.of ___.
