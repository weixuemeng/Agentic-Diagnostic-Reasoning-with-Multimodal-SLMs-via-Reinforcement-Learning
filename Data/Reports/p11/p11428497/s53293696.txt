                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with distension vomiting s/p colectomy now with
 NGT placement  // NGT placement, colonic vs gastric distension      NGT
 placement, colonic vs gastric distension
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to at least the distal stomach.  Slightly lower
 lung volumes. There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some
 increased pulmonary venous pressure.  There are bilateral basilar atelectatic
 changes with probable small effusion on the left.
 Dilatation of scratch then there is no definite evidence of gastric
 dilatation. There are, however, some dilated loops of gas filled small bowel
 in the upper abdomen, highly suspicious for small bowel obstruction.  This is
 confirmed on a study of the abdomen performed subsequently.
