                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cutaneous sarcoid.  Rule out hilar
 lymphadenopathy or pulmonary involvement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Lobulated bilateral hilar opacities are compatible with
 bilateral lymphadenopathy, particularly given history of known sarcoidosis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A moderate-sized
 hiatal hernia is present.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, compatible with sarcoidosis.
 2.  Moderate sized hiatal hernia.
