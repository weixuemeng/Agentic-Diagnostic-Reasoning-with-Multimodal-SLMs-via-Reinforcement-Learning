                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bronchoscopy, lung biopsy  // ro PTX     
 ro PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following bronchoscopy and lung biopsy, there is no evidence of post procedure
 pneumothorax.  Increased opacification in the right infrahilar region is again
 consistent with the middle lobe mass seen on recent CT scan.  The previously
 demonstrated nodules on CT are very difficult to appreciate on plain
 radiographs.
