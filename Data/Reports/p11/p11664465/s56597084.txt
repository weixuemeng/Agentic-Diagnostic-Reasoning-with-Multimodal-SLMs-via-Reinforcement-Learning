                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new OGT  // OGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, just after midnight.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, an OG type tube is present, tip extending
 beneath diaphragm off the inferior edge of the film. ET tube is present, tip
 approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. The right IJ central line tip overlies
 the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax detected. Note is made of slight pleural
 thickening at the left lung apex, similar to the prior film
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiac silhouette unchanged. There is
 upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, with mild blurring,
 suggesting mild CHF. However, this appearance is likely accentuated to some
 degree by the low lung volumes . Again seen is patchy increased retrocardiac
 opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No
 effusion.
 
 The upper portion of the patient's IVC filter is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of OG type tube, extending beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film.
 2. Probable slight worsening of CHF findings. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is
 similar to prior.
