                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with expanding RIJ hematoma causing tracheal
 deviation and now s/p ETT placement  // ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___. Targeted review of torso CT
 from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip 3.8 cm above the carina. At present, the trachea
 appears midline. A right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/ distal SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. There is moderate to moderately severe
 cardiomegaly. Prominence of the mediastinum is noted, in keeping with findings
 on the prior film and likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 Mild left greater right apical pleural thickening is unchanged. The apices are
 otherwise clear.
 
 There is slight upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring,
 suggesting mild interstitial edema. There is patchy opacity at the left lung
 base and the possibility of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 cannot be excluded. The bulk of the left hemidiaphragm remains visible.
 Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
 Minimal atelectasis at the right base.
 
 Metallic density overlying the right side of the lumbar spine is consistent
 with known IVC filter, it incompletely evaluated on this study.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip 3.8 cm above the carina. Trachea in midline.
 2. Cardiomegaly and probable mild interstitial edema.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Question small left
 effusion.
