                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with tortuosity of the aorta.  Mild fullness of pulmonary vessels with
 redistribution to the upper lungs suggests some underlying elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
