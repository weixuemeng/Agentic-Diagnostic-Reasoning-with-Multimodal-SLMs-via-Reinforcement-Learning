                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest discomfort.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If clinical concern for hiatal
 hernia or mass, CT is more sensitive.
