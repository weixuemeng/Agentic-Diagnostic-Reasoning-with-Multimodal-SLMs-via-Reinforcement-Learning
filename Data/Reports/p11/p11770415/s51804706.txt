                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, right upper quadrant pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are
 flattened, consistent with COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with
 slight unfolding of the aorta.  There is upper zone redistribution. I doubt
 more extensive CHF.  There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis in the
 cardiophrenic region.  In addition, there is a band-like area of opacity at
 the right lung base -- ? at lung base versus artifact due to overlying soft
 tissues.  There is some increased opacity posteriorly on lateral view of
 uncertain significance.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate.  No effusion is
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD and mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No effusions.
 
 3.  Band-like opacity at the right base -- ? right lower lobe infiltrate
 versus artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  
 
 4.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region noted.
