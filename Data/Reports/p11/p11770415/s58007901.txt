                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:17 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and urosepsis. 
 Worsening hypoxemia.  Assess pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has worsened substantially since
 ___.  The interval difference is probably due to worsening pulmonary
 edema, but the heterogeneity of the process, particularly in the right upper
 lobe, raises concern for concurrent pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural
 effusions are small and unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Of note, abdomen CT scan
 on ___ showed heavy aortic valvular calcification and heavy mitral
 annular calcification, either of which could be hemodynamically significant,
 particularly the aortic.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 11:10 a.m. and we discussed the findings five inutes
 later.
