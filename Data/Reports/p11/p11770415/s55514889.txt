 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Previously
 seen pulmonary opacities have essentially resolved in the interval with
 possible small focus of opacity in the right upper lung medially.  Recommend
 followup to resolution, consider oblique radiograph.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.
