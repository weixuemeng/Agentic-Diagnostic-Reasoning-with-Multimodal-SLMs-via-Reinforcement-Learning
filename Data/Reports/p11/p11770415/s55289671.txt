                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluation for ARDS or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:10 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Diffuse bilateral reticular nodular opacities with air bronchograms
 and retrocardiac atelectasis.  Simultaneously, no larger pleural effusions are
 seen and the size of the cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. 
 This combination of findings favors edema over pneumonia.  No pneumothorax. 
 No new opacities.
