                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:44 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS and multifocal pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Left perihilar consolidation substantially increased since ___, is now
 severe as findings through most of the right lung.  Given the relatively rapid
 change on the left, I presume that the interim developments are due to
 concurrent pulmonary edema.  Though the right lung is still largely severely
 consolidated, the findings are less pronounced today than on ___ when
 the patient was freshly intubated.  That suggests there may have been a
 component of pulmonary edema or atelectasis that has subsequently improved
 with better aeration from appropriately placed endotracheal tube.  Pleural
 effusions are presumed, but not large.  Right internal jugular line ends low
 in the SVC and a nasogastric drainage tube is looped in the stomach.  No
 pneumothorax.
