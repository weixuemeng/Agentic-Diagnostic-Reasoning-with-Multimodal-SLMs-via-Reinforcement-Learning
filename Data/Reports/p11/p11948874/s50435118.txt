                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular vein central venous catheter ends in the
 upper right atrium.  An enteric tube ends off the imaged portion of the
 screen, likely within the stomach.  The endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic
 inlet.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  There is a large opacity throughout the
 entire right lung likely representing the patient's pneumonia.  The left lung
 is grossly clear.  There is no pleural effusion on the left.  Evaluation for
 pleural effusion on the right is limited.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet.
 
 2.  Large opacity in the right lung, likely representing pneumonia.
 
 At time of attending review, the ET tube had been repositioned.
