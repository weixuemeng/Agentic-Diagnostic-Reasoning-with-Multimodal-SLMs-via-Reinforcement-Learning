                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left lung biopsy,
 assessment to exclude pneumothorax.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The left basal opacities might be reflecting
 interval development of atelectasis versus post-surgical hemorrhage.  There is
 no appreciable pleural effusion.  The rest of the lungs are unremarkable.
