                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  Streaky right basilar opacity suggests
 scarring.  A vague patchy density projects over the left mid to lower lung,
 probably in the lingula, but not well characterized.  There is no evidence for
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An old healed right posterolateral sixth
 rib fracture is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the lingula raising concern for pneumonia;
 however not well characterized on a portable radiography, and if further
 delineation is needed clinically, then standard PA and lateral radiographs may
 be helpful if feasible.
