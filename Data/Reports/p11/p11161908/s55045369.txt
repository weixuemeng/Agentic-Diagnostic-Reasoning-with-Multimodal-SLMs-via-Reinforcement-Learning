                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complete heart block status post pacemaker.  Evaluate for
 dislodgement of atrial pacer lead.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate bilateral
 pacemaker generators with atrial and ventricular leads overlying their
 appropriate positions.  In the lateral view, it appears that one of the atrial
 leads is hanging completely vertically in the middle of the right atrium,
 indicating dislodgement from the atrial wall.  Since the courses of the
 respective leads coalesce in the mid portion of the SVC, it is difficult to
 trace which generator this lead originates from.  Correlation with
 interrogation data is recommended.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear and the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal aside from a tortuous aorta.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dislodged right atrial lead which is unable to be determined
 which pacemaker it originates from.  Correlation with interrogation data is
 recommended.
 
 These findings were relayed to Dr. ___, by Dr. ___, at 9:48 a.m., on
 the day of the examination.
