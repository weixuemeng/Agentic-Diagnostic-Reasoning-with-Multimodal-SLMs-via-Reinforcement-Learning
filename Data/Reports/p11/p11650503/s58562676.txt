                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidations or pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  In the left mid lung zone,
 there is a 5 mm calcified nodule, which is likely from prior granulomatous
 disease.  Alternatively, this may be a small bone island in the third left
 rib.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Small left upper lobe sclerotic/calcific nodular opacity is likely an old
 calcified granuloma or a small third rib bone island.
