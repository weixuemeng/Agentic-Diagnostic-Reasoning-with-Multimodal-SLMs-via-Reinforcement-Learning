                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Subtle opacity in the left lung
 base is more suggestive of atelectasis though difficult to exclude pneumonia. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the left lung base likely represents atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.
