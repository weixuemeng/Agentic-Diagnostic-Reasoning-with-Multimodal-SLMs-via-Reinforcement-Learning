                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  This
 accentuates the size of the heart which is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
