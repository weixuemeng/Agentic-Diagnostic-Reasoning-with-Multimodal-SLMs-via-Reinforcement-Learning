                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pan  // f/u pna      F/U PNEUMONIA RESIDUAL
 CHECK RESOLUTION NO COUGH
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again prominence of the left
 ventricle with tortuosity of the descending aorta. Some hyperinflation of the
 lungs suggests underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  The left basilar
 opacification appears less prominent on the lateral view. This could well
 represent sequela of previous pneumonia.  Coronary artery stent is again seen
 on the lateral view, as well as calcification in the region of the aortic
 valve.
