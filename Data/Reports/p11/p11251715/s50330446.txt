                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dry cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is better inspiration. 
 Again there is diffuse prominence of interstitial markings throughout both
 lungs, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Given the substrate of
 opacification, it is extremely difficult to demonstrate or exclude a
 supervening pneumonia.  The severe chronic pulmonary disease has been
 confirmed by a CT study obtained just after the previous chest radiograph.
