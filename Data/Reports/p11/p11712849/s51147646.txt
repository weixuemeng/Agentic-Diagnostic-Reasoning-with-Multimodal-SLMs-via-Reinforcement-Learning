                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall from wheelchair, SAH and SDH on CT scan
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise grossly
 unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy opacities are seen
 in both lung bases as well as a linear opacity within the right mid lung
 field, likely reflective of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No displaced fractures are clearly identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No acutely displaced fractures
 visualized.
