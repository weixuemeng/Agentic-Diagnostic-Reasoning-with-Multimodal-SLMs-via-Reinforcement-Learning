                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, history of multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there has been increase/development of small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased bibasilar opacities could in part
 relate to pleural effusions and overlying atelectasis, although also relate to
 new consolidation, possibly from pneumonia.  Linear configuration bilateral
 mid lung opacities may be due to atelectasis.  Slight increase in prominence
 of the hila raises concern for central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 There is angulation of several lateral left ribs suggests prior rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
 Increased basilar opacities which may in part relate to pleural effusions and
 atelectasis; however, there is concern for underlying pneumonia.  Prominence
 and indistinctness of the hila suggests vascular congestion.  Areas of
 atelectasis bilaterally.
