                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are now two chest tubes in
 place with the pigtail catheter removed.  Subcutaneous gas is seen along the
 lateral chest wall.  There is a substantial area of pneumothorax in the right
 apical and medial portion of the upper lung.  The remainder of the upper zone
 has a relatively uniform soft-tissue appearance.  Increased opacification is
 again seen involving the lower portion of the right lung.  
 
 The left lung shows no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube with its tip probably about 1.5 cm above the
 difficult-to-see carina.  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
