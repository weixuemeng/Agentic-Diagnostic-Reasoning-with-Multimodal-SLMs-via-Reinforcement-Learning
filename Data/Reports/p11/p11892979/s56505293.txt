  No evidence of pneumothorax, status post right pleural catheter placement. 
  Small right pleural effusion may be slightly decreased in size.  Confluent
  opacities within the right upper lung are slightly decreased.  Heterogeneous
  opacities at both lung bases are increased on the right and unchanged on the
  left.  Findings remain concerning for a multifocal infectious process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax after insertion of a right pleural pigtail catheter.  Small right
 pleural effusion could be slightly decreased in extent.  The massive confluent
 opacities in the right lung have minimally decreased in extent and severity. 
 The basal opacities, however, are overall unchanged.  Slight increase in size
 of the cardiac silhouette.
