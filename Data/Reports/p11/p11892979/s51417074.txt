                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with multiple myeloma and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Only candidates for pneumonia on the CTA ___ were bands of consolidation
 at the left lung base, primarily and in the right middle lobe.  These areas
 persists.  I think along with more characteristic linear bands of density
 traversing both lungs, these are atelectasis.  There are no new developments
 to suggest pneumonia has developed since that time.  Mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable, but previous small pleural effusions have improved,
 suggesting improving hemodynamic status.  No pneumothorax.
