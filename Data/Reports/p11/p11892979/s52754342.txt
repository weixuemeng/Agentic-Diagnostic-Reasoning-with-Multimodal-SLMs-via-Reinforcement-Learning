                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea  // eval int change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular catheter and right-sided PICC are unchanged in
 appearance compared to the prior study.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists.  The previously demonstrated bilateral airspace
 opacities are slightly improved, suggesting resolving pulmonary edema.  Linear
 atelectasis in the left mid lung.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 There is likely a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in the previously demonstrated airspace opacities
 likely reflects resolving pulmonary edema.  Persistent left lower lobe and
 left mid lung atelectasis.
