 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:25 PM
  
  1. Right lung base linear opacity likely reflects linear atelectasis and/or
  scarring, better evaluated on prior CT chest from ___.
  2. Diffuse interstitial prominence is noted, mild, unchanged in comparison to
  chest x-ray from ___.
  3. Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Likely left basilar
  atelectasis.
  4. Stable cardiomediastinal contours.
  5. Possible trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB and cough  // ? pna      ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 read in conjunction with subsequent chest CT on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal consolidation has increased the chest CT on since ___,
 probably pneumonia, though I suspect a substantial component of atelectasis. 
 There is also new peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe.  These
 findings point to chronic aspiration.  Hyperinflation due to mild emphysema. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic there is no good evidence for acute cardiac
 decompensation.  Pleural effusions are minimal if any.
