                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o aspiration pna now with fever, hypoxia
 and hypotension  // PNA?       .  Review of prior imaging studies suggest a
 history of myeloma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  The aortic knob appears high-riding,
 at the upper limits of normal in diameter, but unchanged. Pulmonary hila are
 prominent with a tapered appearance which could reflect presence pulmonary
 hypertension, though they are also somewhat irregular in contour.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild prominence of interstitial
 markings, with peribronchial cuffing and with ___ B-lines noted at the
 lower left chest wall.  Atelectasis and thickening of the bronchovascular
 markings in the right cardiophrenic region is again noted, though less
 pronounced.  This could represent a site of resolving aspiration, infection,
 or atelectasis.  Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion.
 
 Focal density in the left anterior rib likely represents side of an old healed
 fracture or artifact due to overlapping rib shadows.
 
 Medial portion of both lung apices is obscured by the the patient's chin.
 
 Again seen is mild loss of height of ___ mid thoracic vertebral bodies, question
 T7 and T8.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly and background COPD.  Possible pulmonary hypertension.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, relatively similar to the
 prior study.
 3. Resolving changes in the right cardiophrenic region consistent with
 resolving atelectasis, infection and/or site of aspiration.
 4. Upper zone redistribution with evidence for interstitial thickening,
 question chronic versus interstitial edema.
