 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG with sternal

 The patient is after removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Post-sternotomy wires are unchanged.
 The patient is after aortic valve replacement.  Left lower lobe opacity is
 noted, unchanged and most likely consistent with atelectasis in combination
 with small effusion.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
