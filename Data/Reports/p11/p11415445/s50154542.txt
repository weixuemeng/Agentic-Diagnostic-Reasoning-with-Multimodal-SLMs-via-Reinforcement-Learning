                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A nodular density with cavitation along the
 right lower lobe abutting the hemidiaphragm is more distinctly visible but
 probably decreased in size since the prior study, now with smooth margins. 
 This may represent a resolving pulmonary infarct but should be followed with
 either radiography or CT within 6 months to reassess.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2. Persistent nodular density along the right hemidiaphragm, suspected to
 represent a small cavitating nodule associated with prior infarct.  However,
 follow-up is recommended with either radiography or CT within 6 months for
 surveillance.
