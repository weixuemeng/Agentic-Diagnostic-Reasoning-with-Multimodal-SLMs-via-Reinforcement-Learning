                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The lungs appear
 clear bilaterally without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  The patient is
 known to have multiple pulmonary metastases which are not well seen.  A lesion
 in the left lower lobe projects over the posterior margin of the heart on the
 lateral view.  A nodular opacity is again noted in the left upper lobe.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is stable.  Mediastinal contour
 is also stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known lung metastases are again noted though better assessed on
 prior CT.  No definite signs of superimposed acute process.
