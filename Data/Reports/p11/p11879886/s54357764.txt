                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse interstitial
 opacities which are new since the prior examination.  Though likely due to
 interstitial pulmonary edema given evidence of prior cardiac surgery, there is
 no evidence of central venous engorgement, cardiomegaly or pleural effusions. 
 An alternative possibility would be atypical infection in the appropriate
 clinical circumstance.  No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged from prior.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Post-surgical changes
 from prior CABG are unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New diffuse interstitial opacities likely related to pulmonary
 edema, though atypical infection should also be considered.
