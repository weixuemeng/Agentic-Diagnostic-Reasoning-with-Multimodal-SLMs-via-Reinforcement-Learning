                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute-on-chronic shortness of breath, _____ diastolic CHF, known
 metastatic leiomyosarcoma, CAD status post CABG, question pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  The patient is status post sternotomy, with
 cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, likely
 accentuated by what appears to be air within the fundus, dilating the gastric
 fundus.  Aside from some increased retrocardiac density, no frank
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.
 Minimal left lower lobe opacity also noted.  Of note, the chest CT from
 ___ described innumerable pulmonary nodules.  It would be difficult to
 distinguish interstitial metastatic disease from the findings on the current
 study, but the upper zone redistribution and overall blurring does appear more
 pronounced than on ___ and that rapid change supports the diagnosis of CHF.
