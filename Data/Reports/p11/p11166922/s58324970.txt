                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Failure to thrive, malabsorption, congestion and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  A moderate right-sided pleural effusion is noted
 and a small left pleural effusion is also present, findings likely similar
 when compared to the prior exam.  Left basilar opacity could reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size right and small left pleural effusions, similar when compared to
 the prior study.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects compressive
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
