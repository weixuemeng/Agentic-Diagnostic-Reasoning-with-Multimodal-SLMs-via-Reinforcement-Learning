                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right PICC line.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 A PICC line is present.  The tip is not optimally visualized, but likely
 overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is
 detected.  The lung apices are poorly visualized due to lordotic positioning,
 but no pneumothorax is identified.
