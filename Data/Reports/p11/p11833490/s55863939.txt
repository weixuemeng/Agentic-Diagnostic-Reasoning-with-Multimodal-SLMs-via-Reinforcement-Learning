                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The prior exam, there is a new opacity at the left base, concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration.  No other opacity is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal. The heart is moderately enlarged, and unchanged in the prior exam.
 Changes from a prior CABG are noted. Sternal wires are intact.
 
 Again, there is extensive osteolysis of the distal left clavicle, right first
 rib, and left lateral ribs, similar to the prior exam.  The left humerus is
 deformed, and unchanged from prior radiographs. This is consistent with an old
 fracture with significant callous formation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New left lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration.
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Unchanged diffuse osteolytic process, as described above, of uncertain
 etiology, presumably malignant.
