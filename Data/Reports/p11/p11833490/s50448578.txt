 the ___ 3. The finding is demonstrated on several prior examinations but not
 seen for example on the chest radiograph from ___ diced new since
 than.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
