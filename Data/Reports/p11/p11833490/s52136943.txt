 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic prostate cancer s/p left pleurex
 placement today. Now with hypotension.  // Please evaluate for acute
 pathology.     Please evaluate for acute pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the PleurX catheter is
 again seen and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The left PICC line is
 difficult to see, though still probably is within the brachiocephalic vein. 
 Areas of opacification at the left base again are consistent with volume loss
 in the left lower lobe and possible small pleural effusion.
