                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP radiograph demonstrates no focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia. Bilateral hila appear prominent, possibly reflective of pulmonary
 vessels though adenopathy cannot be excluded. Heart is normal in size.
 Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are without an acute
 abnormality. No air under the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent bilateral hilar contours may reflect prominent pulmonary arteries
 though adenopathy cannot be excluded. Comparison with prior films would be
 helpful.  Lungs are clear.
