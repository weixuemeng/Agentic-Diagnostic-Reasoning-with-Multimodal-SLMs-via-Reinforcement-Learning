                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post surgery, now with fever.  Evaluate
 for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There has been interval development
 of an opacification at the right base, likely representing aspiration. 
 Additionally, there is an area of increased opacification at the left base,
 which likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Area of increased opacification at the right base likely represents
 aspiration.
 
 2.  Increased opacification at the left base likely representing a combination
 of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
