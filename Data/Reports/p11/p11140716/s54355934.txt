                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, worsening dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is
 mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, though the lung volumes
 are lower compared to the previous exam.  Persistent triangular area of
 opacification within the lateral aspect of the right mid lung field as well as
 bibasilar airspace opacities are demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, not changed from the previous exam.  No pneumothorax is
 identified although assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's
 chin and soft tissues of the neck projecting over this region.  A pigtail
 catheter is demonstrated which terminates in the region of the right lung
 base, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.  Persistent small bilateral
 pleural effusions with right basilar pigtail catheter in unchanged position. 
 Persistent bilateral airspace opacities are similar.
