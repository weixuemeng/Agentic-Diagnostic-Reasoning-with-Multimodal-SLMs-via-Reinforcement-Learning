 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:30 PM
  The lung volumes are lower.  New left pleural drain is difficult to visualize,
  but overlies the lower left hemithorax.  There is a persistent left pleural
  effusion, which allowing for differences in technique, is stable or mildly
  increased in size.  There is a persistent linear opacity in the mid lung zone
  scarring.  A right pleural effusion is also slighty larger.  No pneumothorax. 
  Stable cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:15 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a new left pleural drain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 9:02 a.m.
 
 A loop of catheter projects over the left diaphragmatic region to the right of
 the midclavicular line.  It cannot be localized anatomically on the single
 frontal view.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax, but I cannot assess
 pleural fluid volume, which could be small or moderate without a lateral
 projection:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is stable since earlier in the day. 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly has worsened since ___, but there is no
 pulmonary edema.  Lower lobes are substantially obscured, by the heart on the
 left and by pleural effusion on the right.
