 right hemithorax.  There is an area of indistinct pleural thickening laterally
 at the level of the right chest wall.
 
 The lung parenchyma overall shows a slightly improved ventilation, notably at
 the left lung base.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Apical pleural
 air inclusions are not present.
