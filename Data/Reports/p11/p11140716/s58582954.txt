                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New chest tube, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A newly placed pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right
 lung base.  Despite this, large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis have increased from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  Assessment
 of the cardiac silhouette is limited.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 A rounded opacity at the right lung base is likely atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  No pneumothorax after drainage catheter placement.  Increasing large
 bilateral pleural effusions.  
 2.  Rounded opacity at the right lung base is likely atelectasis.  Attention
 to this area on follow-up after drainage is recommended.
