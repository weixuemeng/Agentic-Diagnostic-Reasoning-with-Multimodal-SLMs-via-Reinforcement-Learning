 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:07 PM
   Since the prior exam, the left pleural effusion has decreased in size.  A
  small effusion persists.  There is a small-to-moderate, mostly stable right
  pleural effusion.  Stable bilateral linear opacities are likely atelectasis or
  scarring.  Right perihilar prominence may be due to rotation, although a
  developing opacity is a consideration.  Continued attention on follow-up exams
  is recommended.
