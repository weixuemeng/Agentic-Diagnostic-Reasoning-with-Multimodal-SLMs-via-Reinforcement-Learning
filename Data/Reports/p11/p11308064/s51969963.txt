                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV and left rib pain with coughing.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate decreased lung volumes,
 which likely explain an apparent increase in cardiomediastinal size. No rib
 fracture is identified. Left base atelectasis may be due to splinting
 secondary to pain. There is also possible left base consolidation, which can
 be seen with a pulmonary embolus. Surgical material in the upper lung is
 consistent with a wedge resection. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left base atelectasis may be due to splinting from pain, although no rib
 fracture is identified. Possible superimposed left base consolidation can be
 seen with a pulmonary embolus. If there is clinical concern, a CTA chest can
 be performed. 
 
 2. Decreased lung volumes likely explain the apparent increase in
 cardiomediastinal size. 
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
