                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hiv, abnl cxr portable  // follow up from
 prior      follow up from prior
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains within
 normal limits. With the patient taking a better inspiration, the pulmonary
 vascularity is now essentially within normal limits. As on the previous study,
 there is some heterogeneous opacification at the left base, which could merely
 reflect atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical history, pneumonia
 would have to be considered. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again
 seen, consistent either with pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
