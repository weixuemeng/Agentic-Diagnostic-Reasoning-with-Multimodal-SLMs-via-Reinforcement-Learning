                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, presenting with seizure activity.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Predominantly linear
 opacities within the left lower lobe likely reflect scarring and
 bronchiectasis with adjacent pleural thickening. More focal opacity within the
 periphery of the left lung base may also reflect an area of scarring, though
 infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Predominantly linear opacities in the left lower lobe likely reflect scarring
 and known bronchiectasis.  More focal opacity in the periphery of the left
 lung base may also reflect scarring, but infection cannot be completely
 excluded.
