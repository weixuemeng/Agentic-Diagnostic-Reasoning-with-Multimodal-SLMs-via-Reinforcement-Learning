 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe opacity, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement in extent and density of the pre-existing right lower lobe
 opacity.  Large parts of the opacity have resolved.  Minimal remnant
 parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, however, are still visible.  The
 lung volumes remain low.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 fluid overload.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
