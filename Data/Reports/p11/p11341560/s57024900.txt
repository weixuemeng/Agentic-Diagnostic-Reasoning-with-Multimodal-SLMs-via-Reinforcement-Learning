                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post fall with traumatic brain injury and
 facial fractures.  Evaluate for evolution of right lower lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  The opacity in the
 right lower lobe now appears more dense compatible with worsening pneumonia.
 The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothroax.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged, which may be technical.  The imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening right lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia.
