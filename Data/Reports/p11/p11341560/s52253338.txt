                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Head injury, hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  Therefore, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities appear denser
 and do now predominate in the right lower lung.  There is no pleural effusion.
 Unchanged evidence of mild cardiomegaly.  No visible pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal diameter is unchanged.
