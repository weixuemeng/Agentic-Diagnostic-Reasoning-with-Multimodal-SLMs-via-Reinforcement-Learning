                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pancreatitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view was suboptimal as the patient's overlying arm partially obscures the
 view.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Right
 paratracheal opacity most likely relates to vascular structures.  Resorption
 of the distal right clavicle is seen and the bilateral humeral heads may be
 high riding, although not optimally evaluated on this study.
