                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs are not available at this time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient had been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 7 cm above the carina near the thoracic inlet.  An orogastric
 tube terminates in the stomach.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal range.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminating at the thoracic inlet.  If
 clinically indicated, advancing the tube by 2-3 cm may be appropriate for more
 optimal positioning.  No evidence of acute disease.
