                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening dyspnea  // interval comparison
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 07:45.  Targeted review of chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Lungs are overinflated, consistent with COPD.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for differences
 in positioning
 
 Again seen is dense opacity in the lower third of left lung, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with suspected left pleural
 effusion.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured.
 
 On the right, there is minimal patchy opacity at the right base which is new,
 question atelectasis, no focus of aspiration or early pneumonic infiltrate
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 is again seen, possibly slightly more pronounced.  Otherwise, the right lung
 is grossly clear.
 
 Again seen is hazy opacity in an incomplete azygos lobe in the right upper
 zone medially.  This area was clear on the ___ CT scan and the
 apparent hazy density may be due to overlap of the right paratracheal soft
 tissues.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution mild vascular plethora, without other
 evidence of CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Vascular plethora, which is possibly very slightly improved.
 
 Opacity at left base, consistent with collapse and consult and/or
 consolidation, probably with some degree of pleural fluid.  Allowing for
 differences in positioning, this is overall similar.
 
 New patchy opacity at the right base could reflect atelectasis, but a focus of
 aspiration pneumonitis or early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle again noted, possibly slightly
 larger, consistent with a small right pleural effusion.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
