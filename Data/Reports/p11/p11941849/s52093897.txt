                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with WBC ___ and volume overload, OSH record
 mentions retrocardiac opacity on AP view  // pna vs pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 There is probable background COPD.  Allowing for rotation, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 There is increased opacity at the left lung base, likely a combination of
 pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  This appears
 larger than on ___.  The possibility of an associated elevated left
 hemidiaphragm cannot be excluded.
 
 Again seen is a small right pleural effusion, probably similar to the prior
 study on the lateral view.
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation.
 
 The patient has an azygos lobe, likely incomplete.  Given  patient rotation,
 the possibility of some opacification in the azygos lobe cannot be excluded,
 though this could be an artifact due to positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density left base,  compatible with left pleural fusion and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The possibility of elevation of
 left hemidiaphragm cannot be excluded.
 
 Background COPD.
 
 Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF.
 
 Small right effusion, not grossly changed.
 
 Faint opacification of the right azygos lobe, question artifact due to
 positioning.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
