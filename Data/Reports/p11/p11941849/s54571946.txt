  1. Chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears stable, and is most

 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and fever  // eval pneumonia or chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___, and
 CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is chronic, and is consistent with a
 combination of pleural effusion and collapse of the left lower lobe.  Right
 basal opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears stable, and is most
