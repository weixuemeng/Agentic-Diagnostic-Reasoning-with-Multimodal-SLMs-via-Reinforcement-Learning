                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:26 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man.  Evaluate line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, ___:04 a.m.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  New left supraclavicular dual-channel
 catheter ends at the origin of the SVC.  A right internal jugular line
 traverses an introducer and ends in the right ventricle, below the pulmonary
 outflow tract.  There is no new mediastinal widening attributable to line
 placement.  The thoracic aorta is quite large generally and tortuous and
 mediastinal veins are presumably dilated.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened.  Small right pneumothorax is
 unchanged.
 
 ___ was paged at 10:25 a.m., and I discussed the findings by telephone
 with the NP covering the service at 10:45 am.
