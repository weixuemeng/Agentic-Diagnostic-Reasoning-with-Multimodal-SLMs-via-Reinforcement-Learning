                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OG tube placement and ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Aeration is improved compared to the preintubation film however there
 continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and patchy areas of alveolar
 infiltrate and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
