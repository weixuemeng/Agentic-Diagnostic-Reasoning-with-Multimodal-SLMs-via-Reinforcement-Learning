                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is likely present, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There may
 be a trace left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so
 on the right, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Probable small left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
