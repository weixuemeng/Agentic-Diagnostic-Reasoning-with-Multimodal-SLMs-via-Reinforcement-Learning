                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weakness.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged but likely similar to prior study
 given differences in technique.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate
 calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob and a mildly tortuous
 aorta, following the curvature of a mildly dextroscoliotic spine.  The
 previously described right mid lung opacity has resolved.  In the retrocardiac
 region, there is increased opacity.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative changes are seen in the bilateral
 glenohumeral joints.  Scoliosis and compressive deformities appear likely
 unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Retrocardiac density may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia is not
 excluded.
 
 2.  New vague nodular focus in the right lung, possibly a true lung nodule
 such as primary carcinoma.  Evaluation with chest CT is recommended when
 clinically appropriate.
