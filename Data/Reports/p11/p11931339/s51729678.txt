                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent history of left rib fractures,
 presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is continued
 opacification of the left lung base with associated volume loss of the left
 lower lobe.  There is mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles,
 consistent with small pleural effusions.  The previously identified left rib
 fractures are not well seen on this exam.  The heart size is normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Continued opacification of the left lower lobe with associated
 volume loss.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this may represent
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The above findings were communicated to ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 16:25, five minutes after the finding was discovered.
