                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD, CHF, change in pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is again increase in the right lung base opacification, part of it is
 explained by pleural effusion, but is still worrisome for pneumonia.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Mediastinal contour enlargement due to
 lymphadenopathy was better depicted in the recent CT scan.  Possible
 persistence of the left upper lobe consolidation described on the CT could be
 reassessed with CT if clinically warranted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Stable mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increase in right basal lung opacity is probably a mix of pleural effusion
 and pneumonia.
 
 3.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 
 4.  Left upper lobe consolidation described on ___ CT scan is possibly
 persistent and it could be reassessed with dedicated CT if clinically
 warranted.
