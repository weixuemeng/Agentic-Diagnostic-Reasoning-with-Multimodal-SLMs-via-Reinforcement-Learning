                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, question CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable given differences in inspiration.  There is prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement/pulmonary
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions
 are seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Surgical hardware is partially imaged
 at the superior aspect of the image.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting pulmonary engorgement.
