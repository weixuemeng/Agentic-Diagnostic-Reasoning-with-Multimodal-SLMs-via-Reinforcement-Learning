                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged with prominence of the superior mediastinal contour likely due to
 underlying lymphadenopathy. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
 Ill-defined focal opacity within the right upper lobe appears relatively
 unchanged.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in both lung bases. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected. Clips from prior cholecystectomy are demonstrated
 in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Degenerative changes are noted in
 both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Persistent focal ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe which remains
 concerning for infection, but is non-specific and infarction is not excluded.
 Consider chest CTA for further assessment.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
