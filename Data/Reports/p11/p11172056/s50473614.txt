                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with CHF and hypoxia, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Right basal opacification is slowly
 increasing and is worrisome for either infection or aspiration.  Mediastinal
 contour enlargement seen in the chest CT of ___ is due to enlarged
 lymphadenopathy.  On the previous chest CT, a consolidation of unknown
 etiology was seen in the posterior left upper lobe, possibly persistent on
 this chest x-ray.  If clinically warranted, a repeat chest CT could be done to
 reassess this area.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Increase in right basal consolidation which could represent pneumonia or
 aspiration as mentioned on yesterday's chest x-ray.
 3.  Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 4.  Repeat chest CT could be considered to reassess the left upper lobe
 consolidation described in the CT of ___.
