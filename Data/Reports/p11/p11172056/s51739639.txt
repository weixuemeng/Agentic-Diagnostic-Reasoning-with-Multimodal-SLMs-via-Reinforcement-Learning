                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal contours are persistently wide,
 but relatively stable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild
 peribronchial cuffing, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is noted bilaterally.  Linear opacities in the lung bases
 are compatible with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Cervical spinal fusion
 hardware is partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions.  
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 3. Persistent mediastinal widening for which correlation with CT is
 recommended.
