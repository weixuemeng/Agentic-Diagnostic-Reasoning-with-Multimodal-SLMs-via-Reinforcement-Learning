                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea.  Evaluate for congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, portable upright.  There is moderate pulmonary edema as well
 as small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The heart size is minimally enlarged, unchanged from the
 patient's baseline. Unchanged widening of the mediastinum is attributable to
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Aorta remains tortuous. There is no pneumothorax.
 Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged. Degenerative changes of
 the right glenohumeral joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure.
