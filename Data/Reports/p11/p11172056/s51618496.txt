                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New-onset atrial fibrillation with cough and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is mild pulmonary edema, with
 a new more focal area of consolidation in the right lower lung field.  There
 is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Heart size is unchanged.  There
 are incompletely imaged cervical spinal hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, resulting from decompensated congestive
 heart failure.  In the right clinical setting, the more focal opacity in the
 right lower lung could represent infectious consolidation.  Repeat imaging may
 be obtained after diuresis to better assess this region.
