                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post treatment for questionable
 respiratory infection on ___ with Z-PAK.  Assess appearance of two
 indeterminate regions of opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Heart size, mediastinal structures are unchanged.
 Likewise, the previously described densities in the right apical area as well
 as the subtle changes in the left-sided mid lung field appear rather unchanged
 on the frontal view.  Also noted are local pleural apical thickenings in
 conjunction with the right upper lobe apical densities as well as previously
 not described similar pleural densities in the left apical area.  Thus, all
 the described changes are unaltered.  The findings thus indicate that they are
 not active. As a conclusive diagnosis is not obtained, one may recommend a
 chest CT to evaluate the present abnormalities in greater detail.
