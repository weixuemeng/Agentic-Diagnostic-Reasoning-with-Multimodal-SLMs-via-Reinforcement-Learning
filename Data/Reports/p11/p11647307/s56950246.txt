                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, shortness of breath, wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated but no
 flattening of the diaphragm.  There is a region of heterogeneous opacity in
 the right apex with radial linear sclerosis between it and the mediastinum.  A
 more subtle opacity is also seen in the left lower lobe.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two indeterminate regions of opacity, the chronicity of which
 cannot be determined without prior chest radiographs from at least ___ years
 ago.  If these regions have been present for a long period of time, their
 appearance would be consistent with latent infection with tuberculosis. 
 However, an acute infectious process cannot be ruled out on this single study.
 Follow up in one month after the patient's acute symptoms have resolved is
 required.
 
 Findings were communicated to ___, NP by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 on ___ at 11:50 a.m.
