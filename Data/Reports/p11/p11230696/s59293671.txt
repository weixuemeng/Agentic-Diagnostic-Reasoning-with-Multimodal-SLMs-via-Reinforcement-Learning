                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia diagnosed at an outside hospital.  Evaluate
 for resolution.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A small rounded opacity is seen overlying
 the right hemithorax.  This is most likely due to a nipple shadow or
 overlapping structures at the costochondral junction.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, no evidence of
 pneumonia.
