 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Desaturation and aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy retrocardiac opacification appears similar to the prior
 examination.  Mild hazy opacities can be seen in both lungs, but predominantly
 in the right mid lung, where cuffed airways are visible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse mild opacification, somewhat more prominent on the right
 than left, which could be seen with aspiration, among other possible causes,
 including pulmonary edema.
