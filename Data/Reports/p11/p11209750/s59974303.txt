                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizure and agitation  // eval for pulmonary
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The minor fissure is retracted, suggesting
 atelectasis in the right upper zone.  Minimal patchy opacity at both lung
 bases likely represents atelectasis, but an early aspiration pneumonia or
 other pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No frank
 consolidation or air bronchograms identified.  No gross effusion.  Apparent
 vascular plethora is likely an artifact of low inspiratory volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is also prominent, but likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retraction of minor fissure suggests atelectasis in the right upper zone,
 of uncertain etiology.
 2. Probable atelectasis both lung bases, with low lung volumes.  Early
 infectious infiltrate or aspiration pneumonitis is considered less likely, but
 remains in the differential.
 3. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings,
 likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 4. Recommend repeat assessment after resolution of acute symptom with chest
 x-ray obtained with good inspiration, to better assess the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and lung bases and to assess for any persistence of the right upper
 zone atelectasis.
