 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show mild diffuse bilateral interstitial and
 multifocal airspace opacities, which are asymmetric to the right.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is present.  A right subclavian
 stent is noted unchanged.

 Asymmetric air space opacities right greater than left could represent
 asymmetric edema or a right sided pneumonia.
