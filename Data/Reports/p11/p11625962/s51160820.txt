                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable including cardiomegaly and tortuous
 aorta.  Interstitial linear opacities have slightly improved since the prior
 study and might be consistent with gradual improvement in pulmonary edema
 which is still present, mild to moderate.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 cannot be excluded, but no substantial amount of pleural fluid is seen.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
