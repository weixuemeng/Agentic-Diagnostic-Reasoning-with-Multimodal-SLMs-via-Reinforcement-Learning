                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Chest tightness, dizziness, shortness of breath. Evaluate interval
 worsening or resolution of PNA. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  As compared
 to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is improved aeration of the
 right lung base. Persistent bibasilar opacities likely reflect chronic
 interstitial abnormality as on prior chest CT ___. No new focal
 consolidations are noted. There are improved bilateral pleural effusions.
 There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. Improved right lung base opacity likely
 reflecting resolving pneumonia with persistent bibasilar interstitial
 opacities, which likely relate to known chronic lung disease.
