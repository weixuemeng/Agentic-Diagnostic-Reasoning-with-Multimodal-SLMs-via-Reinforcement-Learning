                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size remains mild to moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Widening of the superior
 mediastinum is compatible with known thyroid goiter, as seen on the prior CT. 
 Increased interstitial markings are re- demonstrated, most pronounced at the
 lung bases, compatible with the patient's history of chronic interstitial lung
 disease with superimposed mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  More focal
 opacities within the lung bases could reflect superimposed atelectasis though
 infection is not completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Is
 small right pleural effusion may be present.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  More focal patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded.
