                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Since the prior exam, the mild pulmonary
 edema has improved.  A more focal opacity at the right base is present, may
 represent pneumonia or atelectasis, though appears slightly improved from
 prior exams.  A linear opacity at the left base is likely atelectasis.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema with a persistent right basilar opacity,
 which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
