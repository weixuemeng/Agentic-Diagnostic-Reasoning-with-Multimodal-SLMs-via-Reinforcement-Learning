 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace pleural effusion versus
 pleural thickening.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is a fracture of the left mid
 to distal clavicle which is minimally displaced.  Left-sided upper thoracic
 fractures seen on cervical spine CT were better seen on that study.
