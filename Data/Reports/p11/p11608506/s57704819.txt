                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CREST, now with palpitations, please assess for
 cardiomegaly or infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  Heart size is top normal.  Faint
 right lower lobe opacification, increased from prior and also seen on the
 lateral view raises concern for consolidation, possibly due to infection
 and/or aspiration.  S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis with associated
 degenerative change is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Faint right lower lobe opacification, increased from prior and also seen
 on the lateral view raises concern for consolidation, possibly due to
 infection and/or aspiration depending on the clinical situation.  Recommend
 follow-up to resolution.
