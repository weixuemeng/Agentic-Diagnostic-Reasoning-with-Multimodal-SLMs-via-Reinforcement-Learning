 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low-normal.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary
 edema.  Prominence of the bilateral pulmonary arteries may reflect pulmonary
 hypertension.  Mild calcification at the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.

 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 3. Prominent central pulmonary arteries, which may potentially reflect
 underlying pulmonary hypertension.
