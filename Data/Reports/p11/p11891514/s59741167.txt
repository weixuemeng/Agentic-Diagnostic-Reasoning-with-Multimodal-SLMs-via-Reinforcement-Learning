                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is borderline enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aortic
 knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation is present. Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes with anterior osteophytic spurring are demonstrated in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
