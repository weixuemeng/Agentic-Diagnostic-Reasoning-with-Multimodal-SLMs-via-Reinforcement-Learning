                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with neck pain and history of clavicle
 pathology.  Question acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CT neck.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate top normal heart
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 are clear with the exception of likely right greater than left basilar
 subsegmental volume loss.  There is no large effusion, vascular congestion, or
 pneumothorax.  Displaced distal right clavicular injury is likely chronic,
 with evidence of healing.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Likely subsegmental atelectasis in the right greater than left base.  No
 definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Displaced distal right clavicular fracture versus separation, chronic.
