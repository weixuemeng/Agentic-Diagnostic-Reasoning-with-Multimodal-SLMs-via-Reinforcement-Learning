                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, on
 clinical trial, now with exertional dyspnea.  Evaluate for lung pathology.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and remains
 within normal limits.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary
 infiltrates are present and no suspicious nodular lesions for metastatic
 process can be identified.  Skeletal structures are grossly unremarkable with
 the exception of a local deformity with cortex thickening in the right
 hemithorax involving the right-sided fifth rib slightly posterior to the
 axillary midline and most likely representing an old healed rib fracture.  The
 on previous examination suspected right-sided infrahilar pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormality cannot be verified.  On the present examination, the vascular
 structures in this area remain normal and the persistent pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormality cannot be identified.  Observe that the patient has undergone not
 less than ___ chest and torso CT examinations since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest findings within normal limits.  No evidence of secondary
 metastatic deposits or pulmonary masses as can be identified on routine PA and
 lateral chest.
