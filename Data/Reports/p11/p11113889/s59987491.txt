                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic melanoma and right chest
 port, presents with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is a right chest wall
 port whose catheter tip is in the upper right atrium.  This is new from recent
 chest CT.  Patient has known bilateral pulmonary nodules/masses, better seen
 on CT but the most conspicuous of which is in the right mid lung and has grown
 since prior chest x-ray and perhaps even from most recent CT.  It currently
 measures approximately 3.2 x 3.2 cm.  There is no new confluent consolidation
 nor effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, noting that the
 left heart border is not well seen due to prominent mediastinal fat.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormality
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right lung pulmonary
 mass appears to have slightly grown since prior chest CT.  No definite
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
