                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma, hypotension after chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment of the frontal view is limited due to marked lordotic positioning. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac silhouette
 size appears mildly enlarged.  Symmetric fullness of the superior mediastinum
 is due to enlargement of the thyroid, as seen on the previous CT.  The hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is likely retrocardiac atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Multiple
 pulmonary metastatic nodules are again re- demonstrated, better assessed on
 the recent chest CT. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to lordotic positioning.  Probable retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 Grossly unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic
 disease, but better assessed on recent CT.
