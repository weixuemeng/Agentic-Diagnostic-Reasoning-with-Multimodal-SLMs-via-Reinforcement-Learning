                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.  History of metastatic melanoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are multiple
 rounded masses in the lungs, better seen on the lateral view.  Small bilateral
 effusions are identified.  There is more dense opacity projecting over the
 region of the right middle lobe, much of which is due to the known mass,
 although a component of postobstructive atelectasis or infection is also
 possible.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen. 
 Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip at the lower SVC.  Coronary
 artery stents are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral pulmonary masses as previously seen by CT
 scan.  Increased opacity in the middle lobe due to underlying mass with
 possible component of postobstructive infection or atelectasis.  Persistent
 small bilateral effusions.
