                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 patchy right basilar opacity, possibly in the right middle lobe, which may be
 due to pneumonia.  Mild left mid lung atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity, possibly in the right middle lobe,
 raises concern for pneumonia, particularly in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
