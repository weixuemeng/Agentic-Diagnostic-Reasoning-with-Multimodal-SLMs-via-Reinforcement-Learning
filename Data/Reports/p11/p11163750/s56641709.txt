                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size remains markedly enlarged. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely within the aorta.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures is present as result of low lung volumes. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild multilevel
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
