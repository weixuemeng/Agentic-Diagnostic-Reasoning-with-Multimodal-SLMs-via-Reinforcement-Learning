                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with possible stroke/ transient ischemic attack
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, and known bilateral hilar and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is better appreciated on the recent CT of the chest. 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are noted with mild superimposed opacities
 in the lung bases possibly reflective of atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are not substantially changed from the recent chest CT. 
 Approximately 1 cm right apical nodule is re- demonstrated, better assessed on
 the recent CT.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is
 demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Patchy opacities in the lung bases superimposed on a background of
 calcified pleural plaques may reflect atelectasis.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
 3. Right apical nodule and bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are
 better assessed on recent chest CT.
