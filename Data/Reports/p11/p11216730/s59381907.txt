                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus.  Laparoscopic esophagectomy
 and right VATS.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has improved since ___, but heart
 size is normal, and pulmonary vasculature is not particularly engorged. 
 Therefore if this is a persistence of a slowly improving pulmonary edema, I
 cannot ascribe it to cardiac decompensation and therefore other causes should
 be considered, including drug reaction.  Lateral view demonstrates that the
 opacification in the right lower lung is due to pleural fluid collection in
 the major fissure.  Heart size is normal.  I see no pneumothorax.  Mediastinum
 has a normal post-operative appearance.  The layering component of right
 pleural effusion is small and unchanged since removal of the right pleural
 tube.  Infusion catheter ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
