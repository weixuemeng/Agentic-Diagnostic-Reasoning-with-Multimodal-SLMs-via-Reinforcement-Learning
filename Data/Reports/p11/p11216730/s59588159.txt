 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of esophageal cancer, status post decortication,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Right pectoral Port-A-Cath in unchanged position.  Changed right
 predominantly basal pleural thickening that is, overall, mild.  The small
 preexisting linear scars at the left lung base and in the left perihilar areas
 are constant.
 
 Better visible than on the previous examination is a relatively dense left
 apical 3-4 mm lung nodule, likely reflecting the presence of a calcified
 granuloma.  Otherwise, the left lung is unremarkable.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No left-sided pleural effusion.
