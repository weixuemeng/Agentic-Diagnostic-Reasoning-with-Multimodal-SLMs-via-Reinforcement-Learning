  Status post r lung decortication with re-expansion of the RLL and RML, with
  some re-expansion edema. Patchy opacities in the left lung, likely mild edema.
   ETT tip 5 cm above carina. Two chest tubes with tip in the right upper and
  one in the right lower pleural space.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right lung decortication and now three chest
 tubes.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Two apical and one basal right chest tubes are new.  Pleural effusion has
 almost completely resolved.  There is reexpansion of right middle lobe and
 right lower lobe.  There is reexpansion pulmonary edema in the right lung.  ET
 tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is high likely in the
 mid-to-lower esophagus, should be advanced in standard position.  New diffuse
 interstitial and alveolar opacities elsewhere in the lungs are likely mild
 edema.
