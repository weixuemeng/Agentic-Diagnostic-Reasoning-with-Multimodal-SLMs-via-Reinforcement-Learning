                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy and VATS right
 decortication.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Radiolucency in the mediastinum in the subcarinal
 region towards the right is most likely due to air in the gastric
 pull-through.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased.  Two apical and one
 basal right chest tubes are in place.  There is no pneumothorax.  Opacity in
 the right lower hemithorax could be due to atelectasis and/or loculated fluid
 in the fissure.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Right ___-___-cath is in
 a standard position.
