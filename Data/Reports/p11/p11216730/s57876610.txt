                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pleural effusion, status post
 chest tube, rule out pneumothorax and evaluate for evolution of pleural fluid.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 6:00 a.m.
 
 A portable chest film dated ___ at 11:47 is submitted.  It is unclear
 whether this was obtained in the supine or upright position as it is not
 indicated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval insertion of a pigtail catheter into the right pleural cavity
 with decrease in size of the right pleural effusion.  No large pneumothorax is
 seen.  Improved aeration at the right base is consistent with resolving
 partial lower lobe atelectasis.  Left lung remains grossly clear.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are essentially stable.
