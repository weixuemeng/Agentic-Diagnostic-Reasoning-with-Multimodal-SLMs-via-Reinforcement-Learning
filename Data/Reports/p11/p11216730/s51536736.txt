                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 6 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right-sided fluid collection with
 pigtail catheter in place, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___ and
 ___ at 710.
 
 Single portable upright chest film ___ at 6 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC.  Since
 removal of the right pigtail catheter on ___, there is increasing
 accumulation of fluid within the right pleural space with associated airspace
 opacity which most likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Left lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable although difficult to assess due to the increasing pleural fluid
 on the right side.  Residual contrast is seen in non-distended loops of colon.
