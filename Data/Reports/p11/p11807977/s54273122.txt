                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory distress  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, marked worsening of left
 retrocardiac opacification is probably a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although other secondary process such as aspiration or developing
 infectious pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 other relevant change.
