 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT ends 1.8 cm above the carina.  The NG tube has the tip within the
 stomach but the side hole at level the GE junction.  The stomach is distended
 with air.  There is opacification of the left upper lung as well as
 retrocardiac with air bronchograms and a triangular opacity in the right lower
 lung all of which could reflect multifocal aspiration.  The heart is normal in
 size.  There may be a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. ETT ends 1.8 cm above the carina and can be withdrawn a few cm for standard
 positioning.
 2. NG tube with side hole at the level of the GE junction.
 3. Multifocal opacities likely reflecting aspiration, most severe in the left
 upper lobe
