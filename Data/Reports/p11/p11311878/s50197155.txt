                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast ca w/ persistent cough and fevers 
 // evaluate for evolving PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed 2 days earlier, there has been no
 significant interval change.  An ill-defined left perihilar opacity persists,
 and may represent pneumonia in the setting of infectious symptoms.  However,
 underlying malignancy or metastases are also on the differential, particularly
 given slightly nodular appearance on the prior CXR. Remainder of the lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There is mild dextrocurvature of the lower thoracic
 spine.  Surgical clips project over the right breast.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar opacity previously appeared slightly nodular, which may
 represent pneumonia.  However, further evaluation with CT is recommended to
 exclude underlying malignancy or metastases.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendation were discussed with ___
 ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 5:11 PM, 20
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
