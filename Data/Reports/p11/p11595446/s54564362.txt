                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with new onset afib.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Single frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Interval removal of the right IJ line. No pneumothorax.  Lung volumes, the
 bilateral pleural effusions (which are now only small bilaterally on this
 study) have improved. The left retrocardiac opacity remains, likely
 representing atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinum and
 hila are normal.
