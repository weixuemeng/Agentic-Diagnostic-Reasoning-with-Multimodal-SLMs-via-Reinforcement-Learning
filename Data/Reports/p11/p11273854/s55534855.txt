                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post cardiac arrest complicated by
 cardiogenic shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates clearing of
 pulmonary edema, most notable at the bilateral apices. Interval increase in
 consolidation in the right lower lobe. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
 Interval widening of the superior mediastinum posterior to the trachea,
 suggesting recurrence of edema seen on admission.  Heart is top normal in
 size. Endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm from the carina.  A large bore right-sided
 internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid SVC.  Left-sided PICC
 line ends in the cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube is seen entering the
 stomach and out of the field of view.  A right-sided mid-line ends in the
 axilla.  No pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Interval widening of the superior mediastinum posterior to the trachea,
 suggesting recurrence of edema seen on admission, which raises concern for
 possible infection. 
 
 2.  Clearing of pulmonary edema, most notable at the bilateral apices.
 
 3.  Interval increase in consolidation in the right lower lobe.
