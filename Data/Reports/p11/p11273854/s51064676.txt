                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ worsening dyspnea in the past 2 weeks. H/o VF arrest and
 ICd placement, unknown cardiomyopathy  // ___F w/ worsening dyspnea in the past
 2 weeks. H/o VF arrest and ICd placement, unknown cardiomyopathy
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left-sided pectoral ICD.  The generator itself has rotated
 with respect to the prior study.  The single lead is grossly similar in
 course.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  Compared to
 ___.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly more prominent. 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  Previously seen atelectasis the right cardiophrenic region has
 resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pectoral ICD -- the generator is rotated approximately ___ degrees
 in position compared to the prior study.  The lead follows a similar course. 
 Clinical correlation requested.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  The cardiac
 silhouette actually appears slightly larger than on the prior study, though
 this could also be accentuated by differences in positioning and/or could
 relate to different phases of the cardiac cycle.
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
