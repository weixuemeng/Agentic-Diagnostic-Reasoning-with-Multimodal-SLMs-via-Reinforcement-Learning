                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Calcification in the aortic knob and
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperexpanded but clear without focal
 consolidation.  Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Surgical clips
 in the right axilla and chest wall are likely the sequela of axillary lymph
 node dissection and right mastectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
