                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic aspergillosis with recent drainage of right pleural
 effusion, now cough, question pneumonia, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared with prior study, the right-sided chest tube has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Again seen is alveolar opacity in the right mid
 zone extending inferiorly to the level of the minor fissure, similar to the
 prior study.  There is now more pronounced and confluent opacity in left
 perihilar area.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior study, likely reflecting a small
 effusion.  The left costophrenic sulcus is clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Right PICC line tip overlies the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right chest tube.  Allowing for technical
 differences, the left mid zone alveolar opacity appears to have progressed,
 though the right mid zone opacity is probably stable.  Small right pleural
 effusion may be slightly worse.
