                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:59 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with neutropenic fever, suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vasculature, including the hila and upper lobe vessels is more
 engorged today than it was on ___, but there is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion and no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  I would consider
 reevaluate with conventional radiographs if feasible in order to decide
 whether CT scanning is indicated to detect subtle infection.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No pleural effusion.  Adenopathy
 could be responsible for the interval increase in caliber of the hila, but
 there is no strong evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
