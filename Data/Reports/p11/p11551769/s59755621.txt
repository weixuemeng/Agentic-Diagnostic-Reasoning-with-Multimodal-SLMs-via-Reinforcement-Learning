 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Substantial worsening of generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality,
 confluent region of consolidation in the infrahilar left lower lobe, and
 increasing small right pleural effusion have developed since ___.

 pneumocystis.  Atypical pulmonary edema is an alternative, but there has been
 no interval increase in heart size or mediastinal vasculature to support that.
