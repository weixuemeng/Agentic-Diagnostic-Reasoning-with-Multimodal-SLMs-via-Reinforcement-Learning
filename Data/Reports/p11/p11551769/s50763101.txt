                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Refractory AML with recent Aspergillus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___, CT chest ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There
 has been interval worsening of multifocal opacities particularly in the right
 middle lobe and also in the left mid and left lower lung in the same
 distribution as prior pneumonia, worrisome for recurrent worsening multifocal
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right PICC
 remains in place with the tip projecting over the low SVC.  Increased
 interstitial markings are compatible with edema.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multifocal opacities in the right middle lobe and left
 mid and lower lung in the same distribution as prior multifocal pneumonia
 concerning for recurrent multifocal pneumonia.  Concurrent mild interstitial
 edema.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
