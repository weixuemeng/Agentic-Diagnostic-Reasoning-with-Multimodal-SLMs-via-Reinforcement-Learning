                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  AML, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided PICC which terminates in the upper to mid
 SVC. Right upper lobe and left perihilar opacities are again seen.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to a
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  The right
 pleural effusion appears stable to possibly minimally decreased as compared to
 the prior study.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe and left perihilar opacities again seen; as
 before, raise concern for pneumonia.  Persistent right pleural effusion is
 stable to possibly very minimally decreased, with overlying atelectasis.
