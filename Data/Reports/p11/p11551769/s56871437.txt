 INDICATION:  AML, now with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Overall, there is little change from the prior exam.
 There are bilateral opacities which were evaluated on a prior CT and were
 consistent with Aspergillus.  There appears to be a mild amount of
 superimposed edema.  No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
