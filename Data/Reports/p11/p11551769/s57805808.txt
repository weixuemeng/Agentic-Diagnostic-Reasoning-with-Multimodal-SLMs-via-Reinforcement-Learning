                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with refractory acute myelocytic
 leukemia, admitted for rigors and hypokalemia, check position of PICC line.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, but unchanged in
 comparison with previous study.  There is a pulmonary congestive pattern with
 typical upper zone redistribution and perivascular haze throughout.  This
 congestive pattern; however, has improved mildly in comparison with the
 previous study.  No evidence of new acute discrete parenchymal infiltrates and
 the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  A previously existing right-sided PICC
 line is again identified and seen to terminate in unchanged position, some 3
 cm below the level of the carina.  This indicates the lower third of the SVC. 
 No pneumothorax or any other possible placement-related complication.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appropriate position of right-sided PICC line.
