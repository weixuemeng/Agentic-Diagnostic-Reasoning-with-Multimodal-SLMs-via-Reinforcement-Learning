                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p CABG w/sternal drainage
 please evaluated sternal wire alignment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dating from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Transverse cardiomegaly.  Widened superior mediastinum unchanged. 
 Subsegmental atelectatic changes in left lung mid zone as well as bibasal
 areas.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  No large effusions. 
 Right-sided IJV CVP in situ with the tip at the cavoatrial junction/ in the
 proximal right atrium.  The sternal wires demonstrate a slight scoliotic
 alignment with a widened interval between the superior 3 and inferior 3
 sternal wires, but this appears stable compared to prior imaging.  No new
 central lucency projecting over the mediastinum.  Degenerative changes of the
 shoulder girdles.
