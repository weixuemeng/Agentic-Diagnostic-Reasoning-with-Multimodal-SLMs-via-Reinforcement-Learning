                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p sternal washout for tamponade  // eval for
 pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is a right IJ central line tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly with sternotomy wires, similar to prior, allowing
 for differences in positioning.  Platelike atelectasis the left upper zone,
 increased retrocardiac density, possible small left effusion are again seen. 
 Upper zone redistribution with vascular plethora and vascular blurring
 suggestive of CHF again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Cardiomegaly and CHF again noted.
 3. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and possible small left effusion is similar to the prior
 film.
