                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded, without focal opacities.  A triangular
 opacity obscuring the right cardiophrenic angle is compatible with a prominent
 epicardial fat pad, confirmed on the lateral view.  Otherwise,
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are likely from prior cardiothoracic surgery.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
