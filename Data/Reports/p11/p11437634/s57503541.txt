                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male presenting with cough and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT without intravenous contrast ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated and hyperlucent due to known severe emphysema.  There
 are subtle parenchymal opacities in the right apex, which may represent
 minimal bronchiolitis.  There is otherwise no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Single fiducial marker is present in the right
 upper lobe.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal right apical bronchiolitis.
 2. Severe emphysema.
