 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:35 PM
  More dense opacity at the right lung apex appears to have progressed since
  prior chest x-ray.  Given extensive underlying emphysema, CT scan is suggested
  to further characterize as underlying mass lesion is possible.
  Additional subtle opacity at the right upper lung laterally which could be
  seen in the setting of pneumonia although additional follow-up of this region
  is suggested as well.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with dyspnea, recurrent pneumonia, COPD  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated as on prior.  The degree of right apical opacity
 has increased since ___.  Linear opacity extending from the right
 hilum superolaterally may be due to atelectasis or scarring and is new from
 prior.  At the lateral aspect of the scarring/atelectasis is new subtle focal
 opacity.  Right upper lobe fiducial marker is again noted.   The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Old left rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More dense opacity at the right lung apex appears to have progressed since
 prior chest x-ray.
 Additional subtle opacity at the right upper lung laterally which could be
 seen in the setting of pneumonia although additional follow-up of this region
 is suggested as well.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Follow-up chest CT is suggested to further characterize
 right upper lung focal opacities which are new/have progressed since prior
 especially in light of underlying emphysema as mass lesion is possible.
