  Pulmonary emphysema. No evidence of pneumothorax.
  
  6 mm nodular opacity in the right mid lung may be due to vascular structure
  although underlying pulmonary nodule is not excluded. Findings can be further
  assessed with non urgent chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob, cp  // ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and relative
 lucency of the lungs consistent with pulmonary emphysema. Fiducial marker is
 again seen in the right upper lobe. In the right mid lung, there is a 6 mm
 nodular opacity which represent a pulmonary nodule versus vascular structure.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable. Old left-sided rib deformities are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary emphysema. No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 6 mm nodular opacity in the right mid lung may be due to vascular structure
 although underlying pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  Findings can be further
 assessed with non urgent chest CT.
