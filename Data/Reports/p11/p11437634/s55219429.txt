                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleuritic chest pain status post fall,
 recent history of COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Severe
 emphysema and lung hyperinflation are re- demonstrated.  Again demonstrated
 about a fiducial marker within the right upper.  No additional new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multiple remote
 left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe emphysema.  Right upper lobe focal opacity about a fiducial marker
 appears unchanged from the prior chest radiograph and may reflect an area of
 ongoing infection.  Continued followup radiographs after completion of
 treatment is recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
