                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD p/w marked SOB  // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lungs are clear though lucent and
 hyperinflated which likely reflect COPD.  A tiny clip projects over the right
 upper lung.  Scarring in the right lung apex appears slightly more
 conspicuous.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing evidence for
 pneumonia or edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Chronic left
 ribcage deformities noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema with subtle increased opacity at the right lung apex which may
 represent scarring though difficult to exclude a developing pneumonia.  Please
 correlate clinically and follow-up to resolution advised.
