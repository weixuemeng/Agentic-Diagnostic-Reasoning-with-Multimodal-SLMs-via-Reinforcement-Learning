 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pneumothorax status post chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated same day, ___ approximately 1 hr

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 a chest tube within the right hemithorax which medially projects over the
 midline.  Previously seen right pneumothorax is no longer appreciated. Lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggestive of
 emphysematous changes. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with apparent resolution of right
 pneumothorax.  Chest tube extends medially to the midline and appears to
 overlap the mediastinum on this single view.
