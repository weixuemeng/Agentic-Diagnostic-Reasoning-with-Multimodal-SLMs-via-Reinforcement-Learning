                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DVT and PE history with acute shortness of breath, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the left base obscuring the hemidiaphragm and consistent with
 lower lobe pneumonia.  The remainder of the study is essentially within normal
 limits, though there is hyperexpansion consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.
