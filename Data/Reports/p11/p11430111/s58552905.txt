 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, unchanged in appearance when compared to the
 prior study.  Valve prosthesis also noted.  Previous median sternotomy and
 coronary artery bypass graft clips seen.  Smooth widening of the superior
 mediastinum is likely vascular and unchanged compared the prior study.  No
 lobar consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  The right hilum

 multiple prior studies dating back to ___.  Small right pleural effusion.

 Apparent superior displacement of the right hilum is unchanged compared to
 multiple prior studies.  This does appear slightly enlarged which may reflect
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Recommend repeat chest radiographs when the
 patient's clinical condition improves.
