                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post CABG, here to reevaluate for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  An ill-defined opacity at the right lung base is consistent with
 atelectasis.  Opacities in the left lung base may represent atelectasis, but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG with pneumopericardium
 noted on the lateral radiograph.  An aortic valve prosthesis is in place. 
 Surgical clips are noted in the thoracoabdominal region consistent with prior
 repair of a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Opacification at the left lung base may represent atelectasis in this
 postoperative patient, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical context.
 2.  Stable appearance status post cardiac surgery.
