                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion after drainage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, thoracentesis
 has been performed.  No convincing evidence of a pneumothorax.  
 
 Unfortunately, the outer portion of the right hemithorax has been excluded
 from the image, so that the degree of pleural effusion cannot be accurately
 assessed.  Repeat study should be obtained demonstrating this region.
