 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal,
 hilar, and cardiac silhouettes.  Overall, there is improved aeration with
 minimal residual atelectasis in bilateral lung bases.  There has been interval
 removal of mediastinal and chest tube drains without development of
 pneumothorax.  SG catheter, nasogastric tube, and endotracheal tube have also
 been removed.  No pleural effusion evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of chest tube without development of
 pneumothorax.  Improved aeration of lungs bilaterally.  No pleural effusion.
