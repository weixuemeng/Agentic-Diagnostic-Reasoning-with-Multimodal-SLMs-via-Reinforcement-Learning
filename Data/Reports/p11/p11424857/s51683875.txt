                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/sob, please eval for occult pna, pulm edema  // ___M w/sob,
 please eval for occult pna, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  Apparent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with peaking laterally suggests a subpulmonic effusion.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no left effusion.  Cardiac silhouette
 appears enlarged but not well assessed due to silhouetting on the right.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to a
 subpulmonic effusion.
