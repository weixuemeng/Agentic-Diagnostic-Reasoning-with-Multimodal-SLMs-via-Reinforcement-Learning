                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Linear
 atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe.  Additionally, patchy opacities
 are present in the right mid and lower lung most prominent in the right
 infrahilar region.  There are likely small pleural effusions bilaterally. 
 Drainage catheter seen in the upper abdomen is incompletely imaged on this
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Patchy and linear opacities in the right mid and lower lung are most
 likely due to atelectasis.  If clinical suspicion for pneumonia persists,
 followup radiograph may be helpful.
 
 2.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
