 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob.  h/o copd  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Increased opacity at the bilateral
 bases, left greater than right, is most prominent in the retrocardiac region.
 Additional patchy opacity is present in the right middle lobe, partially
 obscuring the right heart border Note is made of a small left-sided pleural
 effusion. There cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The aorta remains tortuous.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Bibasilar opacities favor atelectasis. Additional patchy right middle
 lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis or infectious pneumonia. Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. .
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
