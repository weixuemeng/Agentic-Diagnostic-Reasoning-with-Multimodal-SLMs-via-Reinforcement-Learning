                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the rib cage. 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Pre-existing areas of bilateral symmetrical pleural thickening
 are unchanged.
 
 The lungs show signs of overinflation that could, for example, reflect
 moderate COPD.  There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia and no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
