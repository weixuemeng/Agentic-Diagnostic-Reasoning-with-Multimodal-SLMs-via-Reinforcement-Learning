 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent influenza, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pleural effusion,
 associated to a minor degree of left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis, is
 unchanged.  The lungs have slightly increased in transparency, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumothorax.
