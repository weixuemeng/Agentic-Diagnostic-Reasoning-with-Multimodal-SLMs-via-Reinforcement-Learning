                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and without change.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion is again
 demonstrated, and likely has a subpulmonic component.  Adjacent atelectasis in
 the left retrocardiac region has partially cleared.  Known right lower lobe
 lung nodule is seen to better detail on prior abdominal CT ___ ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion with likely subpulmonic component.  If
 warranted clinically, left lateral decubitus radiograph may be helpful to
 better quantify the amount of pleural fluid.
 2.  Right lower lobe lung nodule, more fully characterized on recent CT.
