                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recurrent lymphoma, now admitted for SBO. 
 Study requested for evaluation of NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval placement of an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm,
 its tip terminates in the gastric fundus.  There is increased retrocardiac
 opacity as well as increased opacity at the left lung base, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and increased left pleural effusion.  Nodular
 opacity at the right lung base may correspond to a lobulated pulmonary nodule
 identified in the right lower lobe on prior chest CT from ___.  No
 new focal consolidations are identified.  There is no definite pneumothorax.
 Cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to overlying lower left lung
 opacity. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Adequate position of enteric tube.
 
 2.  Increased retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity are likely a
 combination of atelectasis and increased left pleural effusion.
