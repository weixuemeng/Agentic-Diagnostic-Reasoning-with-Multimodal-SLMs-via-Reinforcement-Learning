                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 There is increased opacification at both bases with blunting of the
 costophrenic angles, most likely reflecting atelectatic changes and pleural
 effusions.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  Right subclavian line has been
 removed.  Suggestion of an impression on the lower right cervical trachea
 raises the possibility of a thyroid mass.
