                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after ventricular
 fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC/cavoatrial junction. 
 Left basal atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No substantial interval change except for minimal questionable increase of the
 left basal opacity, most likely atelectasis.  Attention on subsequent studies
 is recommended.
