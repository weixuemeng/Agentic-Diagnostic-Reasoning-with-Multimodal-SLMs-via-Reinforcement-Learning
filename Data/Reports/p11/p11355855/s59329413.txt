                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  PICC placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of the right brachiocephalic vein,
 most likely just proximal to the junction with SVC.  As compared to the prior
 study, there is potentially new right mid lung opacity present just above the
 minor fissure.  It might reflect pulmonary nodule.  Since it was not present
 back in ___, infectious process related to patient's fever might be a
 possibility and assessment with chest CT is recommended.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.
