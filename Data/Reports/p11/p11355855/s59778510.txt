                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastric bypass, rule out free intra-abdominal air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the current radiograph, the patient carries a new nasogastric
 tube.  The tip of the tube terminates at the level of the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The patient also carries an unchanged right internal jugular vein
 catheter.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, atelectasis
 or pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  On the frontal radiograph, there are no typical signs for free
 intra-abdominal air.  On the lateral radiograph; however, there is an atypical
 anterior air collection in the upper parts of the abdomen.  Given this air
 collection is adjacent to several surgical clips, it could represent a normal
 gas-filled intestinal component.  However, attention should be paid to this
 area on subsequent radiographs (the abdominal radiograph, performed on ___, 6:12 p.m., was unremarkable in this respect).
