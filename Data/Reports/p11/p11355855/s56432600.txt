                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R PICC  // confirm correct placement     
 confirm correct placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is
 little change in the appearance of the right subclavian PICC line that extends
 to the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of
 normal and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle most likely represents
 pleural thickening, though small effusion cannot be excluded.
