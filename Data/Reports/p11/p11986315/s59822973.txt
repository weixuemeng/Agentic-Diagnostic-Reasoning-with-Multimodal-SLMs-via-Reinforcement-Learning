                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening cough after recent treatment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 lung volumes are somewhat low.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 A vague opacity in the right upper lung appears stable suggesting minor
 scarring.  There has been some increase since the prior comparison studies in
 a retrocardiac opacity including slight blurring of the left hemidiaphragmatic
 surface, although not conspicuous on the lateral view.  A focus of pneumonia
 could be entertained as the explanation versus bronchial airway thickening or
 atelectasis.
