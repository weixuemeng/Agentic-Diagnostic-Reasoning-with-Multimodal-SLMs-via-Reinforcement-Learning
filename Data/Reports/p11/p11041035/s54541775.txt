                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___ chest CT and chest radiographs
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Projecting over the lateral right lung is a vague nodular focus, not present
 on the prior examinations.  There is also a potential new lung nodule
 projecting over the left upper lung although the latter may be partly
 artifactual.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  At least one new suspicious nodular focus worrisome for
 metastatic disease; however, atypical infectious processes could also be
 considered, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.  CT may be
 helpful if needed clinically.
