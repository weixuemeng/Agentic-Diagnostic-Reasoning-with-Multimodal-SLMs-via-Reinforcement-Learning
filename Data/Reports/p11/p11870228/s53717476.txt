 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  The
 nasogastric tube takes an unusual course along the lateral right heart border,
 and is probably coiled within a large hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax
 or pneumomediastinum. The heart appears mildly enlarged despite the
 projection. Aortic arch calcifications are incidentally noted. An increasing
 right basilar airspace opacity may either be due atelectasis or infection.
