 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right pleural effusion, HCV cirrhosis  //
 Eval for right pleural effusion progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC is in unchanged position.  There has been interval removal of
 the left-sided internal jugular venous catheter.
 
 A moderate right-sided effusion persists and is not significantly changed in
 size from the prior examination.  Pulmonary opacity involving the base of the
 right lung is stable and likely reflects atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate setting.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity
 which likely reflects atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
