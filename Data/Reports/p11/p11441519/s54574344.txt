                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCV cirrhosis and R pleural effusion.  Eval
 for r sided effusion progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacification of the right mid and lower lung has worsened, however there is
 slight clearing of the apex.  This could be due to redistribution of the
 moderate to large right pleural effusion.  Gastric congestion in the left lung
 has worsened. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Multiple surgical clips project over the mediastinum. The left internal
 jugular central venous catheter is in stable position in the mid SVC. Right
 PICC is also unchanged in the low SVC.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Redistribution of moderate to large layering right pleural effusion which
 is likely overall unchanged.
 2. Worsening vascular congestion in the left lung.
