                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decompensated cirrhosis here with upper GI
 bleed, shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Low lung volumes are
 present.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  New small right pleural effusion appears decreased in
 size compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more
 pronounced on the right, are not substantially changed in the interval, and
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration in the right
 lung base however cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 Radiopaque focus projects over the right dome of the liver, perhaps a coil,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion, decreased in size from the prior study, with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis, but aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded
 in the right lung base.
