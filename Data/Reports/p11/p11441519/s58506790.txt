                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and hepatic hydrothorax, with ?PTX
 on previous CXR  // Is there e/o PTX?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study and allowing for differences positioning, again
 seen is the small right pleural effusion.  As before, the lung contour along
 the right lateral mid/lower chest wall appears irregular and the presence of a
 loculated pneumothorax/hydro pneumothorax remains a possibility.
 
 Compared with the film from 1 day earlier, there is more pronounced patchy
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  While this could represent
 atelectasis, it is relatively rounded and raises the possibility of a focus of
 aspiration or early pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 Again seen is minimal atelectasis at the left base.    Minimal blunting of
 left costophrenic angle slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.
 Doubt overt CHF.
 
 A rounded 9.7 mm density projects over the left proximal humerus.  In the
 absence of known malignancy, this likely represents a bone island.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right effusion.  The possibility of a loculated hydro pneumothorax
 cannot be excluded, though the size is similar to the film from 1 day earlier.
 
 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region.  Differential diagnosis includes a
 focus of aspiration early pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle.
 
 Rounded density left humeral head.  Please see comment above.
