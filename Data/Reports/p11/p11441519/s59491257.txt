 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:01 PM
  Small right pleural effusion has decreased since the prior study.  Right
  middle and lower lobes atelectasis has also significantly decreased in the
  interval.
  
  Relative ovoid lucency projecting over the lateral right lower hemi thorax is
  felt to most likely be artifactual versus much less likely loculated
  pneumothorax.  Finding is not appreciated on the lateral view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased
 in size since the prior study, as has overlying right middle and lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Relative lucency projecting over the lateral right lower hemi
 thorax may be artifactual versus less likely loculated pneumothorax.  No left
 pleural effusion is seen.  The left lung is grossly clear.  Patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion has decreased since the prior study. Right middle
 and lower lobes atelectasis has also significantly decreased in the interval. 
 Relative ovoid lucency projecting over the lateral right lower hemi thorax is
 felt to most likely be artifactual versus less likely loculated pneumothorax.
