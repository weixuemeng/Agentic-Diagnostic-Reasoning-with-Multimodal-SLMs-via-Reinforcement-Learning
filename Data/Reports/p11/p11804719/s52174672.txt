                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 9:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with alcohol withdrawal.  Evaluate
 nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON STUDIES:  Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful
 to detect subtle interval change.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 9:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified but likely within the stomach.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely within normal limits given patient rotation and portable
 technique.  Streaky opacities at the right base may reflect patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Stable underlying emphysema as there is a
 suggestion of cystic changes in both apices.  No pneumothorax.  No large
 effusions.
