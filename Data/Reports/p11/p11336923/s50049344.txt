                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall and pain in the back.  Please
 evaluate for evidence of acute intrathoracic process or rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no evidence of rib fracture.  Compared with ___, there
 appears to be compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, which
 appears to be T10, new since the prior study, but otherwise indeterminate age.
 The height of the vertebral body is 18 mm compared with 21 mm and 24 mm of the
 vertebral bodies above and below respectively.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  There is mild
 compression fracture of a lower thoracic vertebral body (likely T10) new since
 the prior study, but otherwise of indeterminate age.  Recommend clinical
 correlation for acuity.
