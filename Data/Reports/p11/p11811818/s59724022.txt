                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and leukocytosis, evaluation for pneumonia or other acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  As a consequence, there is crowding of the vascular and bronchial
 structures at the lung bases and a newly appeared retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 However, there is no evidence for acute lung changes such as pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
