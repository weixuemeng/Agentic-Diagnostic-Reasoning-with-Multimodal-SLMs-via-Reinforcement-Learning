                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 542 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing oxygen requirement, evaluate
 for acute process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 542 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes.  Hazy opacity in the left hemithorax likely
 reflects a layering effusion.  There are some streaky linear opacities on the
 left as well as in the right mid lung suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Although there is some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, overall the
 perihilar fullness is out of proportion to the lung volumes, and therefore,
 this likely reflects a component of superimposed perihilar edema.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to differences in
 patient positioning between studies.  Right internal jugular introducer
 catheter is seen with its tip in the distal jugular vein.  No pneumothorax.
