                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 14:44
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Patchy and
 linear bilateral juxtahilar opacities appear similar compared to the previous
 study, and an area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region has minimally
 improved.  Homogeneous, veil-like opacity in left hemithorax probably reflects
 a layering pleural effusion.
