                                 FINAL REPORT
 CXR, TWO VIEWS
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Lung fields are clear.  The superior
 mediastinum appears slightly widened, but this may be projectional.  Patient
 is mildly rotated.  Followup films in four to six weeks' time are recommended
 to keep this area under observation.  Because of varying degrees of rotation,
 comparison to the previous examination of ___ is difficult.
