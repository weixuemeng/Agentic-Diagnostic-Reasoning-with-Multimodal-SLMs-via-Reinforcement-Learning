 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of melanoma  // Please evaluate
 disease status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___
 Chest radiographs to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the CT chest dated ___, no significant changes are
 appreciated.  There are no suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses. There is a
 small, linear focus of atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  Lungs are
 otherwise hyperinflated, unchanged since at least ___, but clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pleural thickening.  Heart size is
 normal.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are normal.

 No radiographic evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease or other acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  Unchanged hyperinflation bilaterally may be
 consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
