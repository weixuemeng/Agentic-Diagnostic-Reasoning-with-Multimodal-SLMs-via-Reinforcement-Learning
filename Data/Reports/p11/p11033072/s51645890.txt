                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  There is prominence of the interstitial markings
 bilaterally suggesting mild interstitial edema.  A more confluent area of
 opacity at the right lung base is seen, non-specific, could relate to
 underlying edema; however, consolidation due to aspiration or pneumonia is not
 excluded.  The lungs remain hyperinflated, most consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural thickening, although trace
 pleural effusion is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild pulmonary edema.  More
 confluent opacity at the right lung base, underlying aspiration or infection
 is not excluded.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due
 to pleural thickening and underlying COPD, although a trace effusion is not
 excluded.
