                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hx chf with hypoxia and leg swelling  // eval
 pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright portable view. The cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged.
 Mediastinal contours are stable. The trachea again courses to the right.  The
 lungs remain hyperinflated. Right greater than left bibasilar opacities are
 again seen, similar to prior, however, it is unclear whether resolved and
 increased in the interval. There is persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  Interval decrease in bilateral mid lung opacities as
 compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right greater than left bibasilar opacities, somewhat similar to prior,
 unclear whether chronic lung process are whether opacities improved and
 worsened in the interval. Recommend followup to resolution, nonemergent chest
 CT may be helpful for further evaluation. Persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.
