                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  CHF.  Bibasilar fibrosis.  Crackles on lung exam today.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The patient was in mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis and
 moderate pleural effusions on ___, so I really cannot tell whether the
 interstitial abnormality at the lung bases today is chronic or represents
 acute cardiac decompensation.  Since there is no pleural effusion and severe
 cardiomegaly is longstanding, I would guess the interstitial abnormality is
 chronic.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
