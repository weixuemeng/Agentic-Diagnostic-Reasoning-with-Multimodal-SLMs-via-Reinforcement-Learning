                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left arm swelling and a hand nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 A large cervicothoracic mass, at least 6 x 10 cm, extends along the anterior
 left lateral aspects of the trachea to the aortic arch in the mediastinum. The
 trachea though severely displaced is only mildly narrowed at the thoracic
 inlet. There is no evidence of hilar adenopathy.  Lungs are clear and there is
 no pleural effusion.  Whether this cervical mediastinal lesion is benign
 lesion of the thyroid gland or a malignancy, including lymphoma, is
 indeterminate from this study.
 
 In the absence of prior chest imaging to show that it has been longstanding
 and chronic, it should be presumed malignant until proved otherwise.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings and their clinical significance over
 the telephone at the time of dictation.
