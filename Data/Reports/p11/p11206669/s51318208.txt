 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic cancer, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.2 cm above the carina.
 The pre-existing signs suggestive of pulmonary edema have moderately
 increased.  There is unchanged evidence of low lung volumes and mediastinal
 widening.  Cardiomegaly is still present.  No pneumothorax.
