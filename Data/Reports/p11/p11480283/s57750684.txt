                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm with adjacent
 opacification and meniscus on the left is consistent with pleural effusion and
 basilar atelectatic changes.  On the right, the hemidiaphragm is much more
 sharply seen.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists without
 definite vascular congestion.
 
 Central catheter extends to the cavoatrial junction or possibly the upper
 portion of the right atrium.
