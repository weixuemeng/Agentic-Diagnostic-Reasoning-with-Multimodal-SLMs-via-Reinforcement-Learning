                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with 2:1 AV block, need pacemaker  // Please assess for
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 minimally increased opacity at the lung bases which likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Irregularly shaped but relatively linear opacities aligned
 vertically along the lateral left chest are calcified and most likely
 represent pleural plaques.  Additional regions seen paralleling the left
 hemidiaphragm and potentially along the right lateral chest wall.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased opacity at the lung bases which likely reflects
 atelectasis.
 Findings suggestive of calcified pleural plaques.
