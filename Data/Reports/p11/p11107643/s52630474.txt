                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  There are low lung volumes which result in bronchovascular
 crowding.  No overt pulmonary edema is identified.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No definite large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable retrocardiac atelectasis, although infection
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No pulmonary edema.
