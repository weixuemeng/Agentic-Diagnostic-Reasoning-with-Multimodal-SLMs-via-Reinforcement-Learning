                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Increased leg weakness.  History of multiple sclerosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a small
 nodular focus projecting over the left mid lung, although likely a summation
 artifact or focus of sclerosis along the end of the left third rib.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Small apparent nodular opacity,
 probably artifact; repeat radiographs with AP and lateral technique are
 recommended when clinically appropriate to reassess.
