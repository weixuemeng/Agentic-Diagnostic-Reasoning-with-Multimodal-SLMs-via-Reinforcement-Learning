                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated, hct 7, upper GI bleed.  // eval
 acute process -- eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph from earlier today at 06:22 am
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph from several hours prior, lung volumes
 remain very low. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Endotracheal
 tube terminates 2.2 cm above the carina. Endotracheal tube cuff appears
 overinflated. ___ tube projects over the esophagus with tip below the
 diaphragm and excluded from the image. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 Patchy bibasilar opacities, particularly in the left lower lung are unchanged,
 probably represent atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent low lung volumes, atelectasis, and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. 
 Endotracheal tube cuff appears overinflated.
