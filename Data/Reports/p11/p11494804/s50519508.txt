                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The lungs appear
 clear.  Although the left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, it appears
 effaced, so a trace pleural effusion is possible on that side.  Metallic
 biliary stents project over the left upper quadrant.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line terminating in the superior vena cava.  No findings
 suggestive of pneumonia.
