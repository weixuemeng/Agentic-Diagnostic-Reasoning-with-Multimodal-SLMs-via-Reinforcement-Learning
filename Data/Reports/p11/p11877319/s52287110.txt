                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  A confluent
 opacity in the left retrocardiac region has slightly improved, but is
 difficult to fully characterize on this single projection.  The right lung
 remains slightly overinflated but grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improving left lower lobe opacity.  Considering rapid development and rapid
 improvement, aspiration is a likely possible cause.  However, followup
 radiographs with PA and lateral technique would be helpful as well as clinical
 correlation to exclude an infectious pneumonia.
