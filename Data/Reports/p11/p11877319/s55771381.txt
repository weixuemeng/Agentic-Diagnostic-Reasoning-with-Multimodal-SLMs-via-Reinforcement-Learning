                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ACS, COPD/asthma, ileostomy, nausea, vomiting,
 diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal contours are stable
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again demonstrated. The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Right upper lobe focal consolidative opacity is
 new, most compatible with pneumonia. Patchy left lower lobe opacity could
 reflect a second area of infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia. Second patchy opacity in the left lower lobe could
 reflect an additional site of infection. Follow up radiographs after treatment
 are recommended to ensure resolution of these findings.
