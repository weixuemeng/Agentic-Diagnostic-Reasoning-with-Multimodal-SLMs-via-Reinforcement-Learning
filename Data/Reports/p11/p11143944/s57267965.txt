                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate vascular markings.  Despite these limitations, there is no
 obvious consolidation.  No effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac
 silhouette is exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  Mild increase
 in heart size cannot be excluded due to differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is most likely
 related to technique.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
