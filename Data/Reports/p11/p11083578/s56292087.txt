                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubation  // evidence of tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip residing 4.6 cm above the carinal. A nasogastric tube is seen terminating
 in the proximal stomach, with the distal side port in the distal esophagus.
 There is mild pulmonary congestion without overt edema. No supine evidence for
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 Heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contour is prominent
 likely secondary to technique. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube positioned appropriately. NG tube terminates in the proximal
 stomach and should be advanced for more optimal positioning. Mild central
 congestion.
