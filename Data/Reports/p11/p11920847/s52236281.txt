                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with diarrhea and dehydration.  Evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  There is left basilar opacity
 which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm and is compatible with a small pleural
 effusion.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the
 lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, stable compared to prior.  Aortic knob
 and left hilar contours are now more clearly delineated compared to prior. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure with small left pleural
 effusion and mild pulmonary edema.  Hyperinflation.
