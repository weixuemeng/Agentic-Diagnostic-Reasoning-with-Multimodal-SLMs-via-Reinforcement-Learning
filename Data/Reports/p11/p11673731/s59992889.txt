                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are streaky basilar
 opacities most suggestive of atelectasis.  These are somewhat conspicuous in
 the retrocardiac area on the lateral view.  There is a slight peribronchial
 vascular thickening bilaterally with peribronchial cuffing suggesting an
 inflammatory or perhaps infectious process involving lower airways.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly prominent interstitium with peribronchial cuffing for
 which differential considerations include inflammation or potentially
 infection involving lower airways.  Although bronchopneumonia is difficult to
 entirely exclude, streaky basilar opacities are probably due to the same
 process and atelectasis rather than consolidative pneumonia.
