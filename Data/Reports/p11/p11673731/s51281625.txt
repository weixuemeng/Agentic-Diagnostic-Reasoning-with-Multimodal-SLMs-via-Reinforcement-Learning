                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration or pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy opacities at lung
 bases may reflect pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.  Consider repeat PA
 and lateral views when the patient is able to take a deeper inspiration.
