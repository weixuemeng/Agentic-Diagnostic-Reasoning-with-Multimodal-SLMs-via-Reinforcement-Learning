                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report of CT of the chest from Atrius  dated ___. 
 Images are not available for direct review.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post right mastectomy.  Superior paramediastinal
 opacities likely related to prior radiation changes.  Heart size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Calcification is noted projecting over the anterior
 chest on the lateral view, not clearly localized on the frontal view of
 unclear etiology, possibly a pleural plaque as these were reported on the
 prior chest CT.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Numerous clips
 are seen within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Superior paramediastinal hazy opacities likely relate to prior radiation
 therapy for Hodgkin disease.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise
 demonstrated.
