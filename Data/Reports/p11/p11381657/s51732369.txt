                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis and/or scarring with unchanged mild blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus likely reflective of pleural thickening rather than a
 small pleural effusion. The remainder the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacity in the left lung base appears similar compared to the previous
 exam, likely reflective of atelectasis and/or scarring and adjacent pleural
 thickening.
