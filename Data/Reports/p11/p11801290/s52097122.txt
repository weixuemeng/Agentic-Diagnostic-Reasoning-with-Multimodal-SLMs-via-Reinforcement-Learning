 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:40 PM
  In comparison to the examination from 3 hours prior there has been interval
  placement of a tracheal tube which ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  Mild
  cardiomegaly is stable.  There has been rapid opacification of the inferior
  right lower lobe, which may be due to rapidly accumulating pleural effusion or
  aspiration, as there is no sign of volume loss.  A left IJ line ends at the
  mid SVC.
