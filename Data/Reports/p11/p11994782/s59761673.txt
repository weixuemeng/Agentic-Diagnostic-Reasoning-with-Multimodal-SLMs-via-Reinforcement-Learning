                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with positive ppd. 20mm induration. r/o tb
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal contour is normal. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Right infrahilar opacity is mild and may represent
 adenopathy or a pericardial cyst. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No good evidence of TB infection.
 2. In the absence of evidence of adenitis elsewhere, the right infrahilar
 opacity is unlikely to be isolated adenopathy due to TB. It is much more
 likely to be a pericardial cyst. Consider chest CT if there is evidence of
 adenopathy elsewhere.
