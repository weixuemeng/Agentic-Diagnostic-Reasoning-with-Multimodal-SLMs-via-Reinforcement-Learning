                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is stable marked hyperinflation
 of the lungs, upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature, findings
 consistent with underlying known severe emphysema.  No confluent opacities
 identified to suggest aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 unchanged compared to prior examination and may be related to pleural
 thickening.  There is no pleural effusion.  The aortic knob remains markedly
 calcified.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe emphysema without acute cardiopulmonary process.
