                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and left chest wall pain.  Evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Fractures of the right ___ and left 8th ribs are unchanged from at
 least ___.  There are no new, acutely displaced rib fractures. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increased opacity within the
 right upper lung on the frontal view is likely a confluence of shadows,
 however, there is a rounded opacity superior to the aorta on the lateral view
 which could represent an underlying lesion.  Repeat imaging with a lordotic
 view is recommended.  
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  The hilar structures are
 unremarkable.  There is no focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  No acutely displaced rib fracture.  If clinical concern for fracture
 persists, a dedicated rib series with markers would be of utility.
 2.  Lordotic views recommended to exclude underlying right lung apex lesion.
 
 These findings were e-mailed to the ED QA nurses on ___ at ___.
