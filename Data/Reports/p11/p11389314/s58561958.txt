                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With these limitations in mind, no gross areas of
 consolidation are identified to suggest the presence of pneumonia, but repeat
 study with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to more fully exclude
 this possibility if clinical suspicion for infection persists.
