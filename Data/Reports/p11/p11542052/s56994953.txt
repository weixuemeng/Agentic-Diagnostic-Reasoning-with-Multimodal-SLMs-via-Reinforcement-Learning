                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post intubation for altered mental
 status and seizures,? infiltrates and location of ET tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Rotation limits
 interpretation.  ET tube terminates 1 cm above the carina and is too low.  NG
 tube is in the stomach.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed on this AP
 view.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There are patchy areas of
 opacity within both lungs, left greater than right.  This could represent
 pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No significant pleural effusions and
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is positioned too low.  Suggest withdrawing the tube by
 2-3 cm.
 2.  Bilateral patchy areas of opacification could represent pneumonia or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.
