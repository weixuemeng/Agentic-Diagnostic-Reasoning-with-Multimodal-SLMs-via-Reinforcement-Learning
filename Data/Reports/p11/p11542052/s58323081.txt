                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 1.7 cm above the carina
 and could be withdrawn 1 to 2 cm for standard positioning.  Nasogastric tube
 remains in standard position.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and
 accompanied by worsening asymmetrical perihilar and basilar opacities, left
 greater than right.  Small left pleural effusion is apparently new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low position of endotracheal tube, which could be withdrawn a few
 centimeters for standard positioning.  This finding has been communicated by
 telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 7:45 a.m. at the time of
 discovery.
 2.  Worsening asymmetrical perihilar and basilar opacities, which may be due
 to asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Given history of seizures, aspiration
 pneumonia is an additional consideration.
 3.  New small left pleural effusion.
