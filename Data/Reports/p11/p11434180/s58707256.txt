                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic rectal small cell cancer on
 chemotherapy, presenting with altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained.  The heart
 is of normal size.  Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities are new since the
 prior radiograph, exaggerated by low lung volumes, and may represent
 multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.  There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, compatible with small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Osseous structures are unremarkable and known osseous metastases are
 not appreciated on this exam.  A metallic biliary stent is seen in the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities, compatible with either
 multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion.
