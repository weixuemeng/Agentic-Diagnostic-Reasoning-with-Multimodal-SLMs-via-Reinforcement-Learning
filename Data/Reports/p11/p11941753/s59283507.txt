                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, status post CABG.  Presenting
 with subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as an upper respiratory tract infection
 symptoms for the past several days.  Now febrile.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, new compared to the
 outside hospital radiograph performed approximately 7 hours ago.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  There is subsegmental bilateral
 lower lung atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is status
 post CABG, with intact midline sternotomy wires.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Given the patient's new onset
 fevers, a concomitant infectious process cannot be excluded; a followup
 radiograph is recommended after appropriate diuresis.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
