 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post cardiac arrest, check for

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 3 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Left
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC.  A right internal
 jugular introducer catheter remains in place.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy for CABG.  There are
 persistent but improving opacities at both apices and involving the left upper
 and mid lung.  These findings may represent resolving aspiration or pulmonary
 hemorrhage related to recent cardiac arrest or resolving pulmonary edema in an
 atypical distribution.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No large effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.
