                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Interval improvement of parenchymal opacities is
 demonstrated consistent with resolution of most likely asymmetric pulmonary
 edema versus hemorrhage.  Minimal bibasal atelectasis is unchanged and small
 amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Left internal and right
 internal jugular lines are unchanged in appearance.
