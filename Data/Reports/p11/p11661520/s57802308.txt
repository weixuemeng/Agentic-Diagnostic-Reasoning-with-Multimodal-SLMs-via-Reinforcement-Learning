                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute shortness of breath.  Patient status post ORIF.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent
 with COPD.  Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of atelectasis and
 pleural effusion, better seen in concurrent CT.  There is also a small left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
