                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NASH cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis p/w GI
 bleed now with new ___ requirement  // evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since 3 days prior, there are increased interstitial opacities bilaterally,
 reflect interval development of mild pulmonary edema.  The degree of edema and
 fibrosis could conceivably obscure other parenchymal processes.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, mild pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease.
