 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and
 compared to the prior study.  A left anterior axillary bielectrode pacemaker
 has intracavitary electrodes, the first in position compatible with the right
 atrial appendage and the second lead in position compatible with the apical
 portion of the right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged and the
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no vascular
 congestion, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are no
 concerning osseous or soft tissue lesions.
