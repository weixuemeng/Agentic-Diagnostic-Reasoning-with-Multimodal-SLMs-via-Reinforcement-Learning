                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with p/w BLE foot wounds;  // eval for port
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval placement of a single lead left-sided AICD with lead
 extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.  There has also
 been placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter,
 terminating in the the low SVC.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles best seen on
 the lateral view is consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Sternal hardware is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
