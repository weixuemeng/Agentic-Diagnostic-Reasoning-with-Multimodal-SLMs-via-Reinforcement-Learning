                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and bacteria in sputum.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and enteric tube. 
 Lung volumes remain low and crowd the pulmonary vascular structures.  Cardiac
 silhouette appears stably enlarged.  Bilateral interstitial opacities are
 noted and likely represent mild pulmonary edema.  However, an underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  No focal consolidation is identified. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral interstitial opacities likely representing
 mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation is identified. A dedicated PA and
 Lateral Chest Radiograph is recommended when the patient can tolerate.
