                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate after intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube in the low trachea approximately 2 cm from
 the carina.  A nasogastric tube can be traced to the mid chest, but cannot be
 traced further.  The lung volumes are low.  There is vascular engorgement and
 diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, most consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is widened, which may be due to
 technique, although acute aortic dissection is a consideration.  The heart
 size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly.
 2.  Widened mediastinum, which may be due to technique, although acute aortic
 dissection is a consideration.
 3.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube.
 4.  The nasogastric tube cannot be traced below the mid chest, due to
 technical limitations.  If imaging confirmation is required, consider a repeat
 chest radiograph.
