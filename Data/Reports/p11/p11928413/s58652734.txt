                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p intubation  //
 ?edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carinal. A right internal
 jugular catheter is stable in position in the distal SVC.  And enteric tube
 descends below the field of view.
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low, which may accentuate bronchovascular markings.
 Given that, bilateral pulmonary opacities are increased (right much greater
 than left) from the prior examination most consistent with infection or
 moderate pulmonary edema. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Pleural
 effusions are presumed but are not large.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Opacities, which predominantly involve the right lung are
 increased from the prior examination a may represent infection or asymmetrical
 pulmonary edema.
