                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea/labored breathing, saturating
 well, afebrile, known CHF  // ?CHF exacerbation vs pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 05:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen right IJ line has been removed.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  Again seen is a left-sided single lead pacemaker (transvenous right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator) with lead over the right ventricle.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Again seen are low inspiratory volumes.  Stable
 prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, with fixation hardware again
 noted -- this appearance is likely accentuated by AP technique, low volumes,
 lordotic positioning.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, overall similar to the prior study.  Patchy
 right perihilar opacity is are also similar, possibly slightly more
 pronounced.  Equivocal vascular engorgement.  No gross effusion.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Overall, the appearance is quite similar to the ___ chest x-ray.
 2. CHF difficult to assess, but probably not worse compared with the prior
 film.  No gross effusions, though small effusions could very well be present.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or pneumonic consolidation is grossly
 unchanged.
 4. Opacity seen in the right perihilar region is of uncertain etiology
 --___ atelectasis, but an infectious infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded.  This appearance is also similar, possibly minimally worse, compared
 to the prior study.
