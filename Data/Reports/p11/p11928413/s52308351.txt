                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // evaluate ETT, OGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recent ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The ET tube and NG tube are in appropriate position. A right middle/lower lobe
 consolidation along with patchy opacities in the left lower lobe are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  The
 differential also includes asymmetric pulmonary edema, although there no large
 pleural effusions and the cardiac size is normal. No evidence pneumothorax.
