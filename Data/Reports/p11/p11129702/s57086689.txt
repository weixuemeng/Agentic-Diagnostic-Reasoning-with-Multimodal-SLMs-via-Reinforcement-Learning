 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Areas of linear atelectasis are present at both lung bases. 
 Additional slightly more confluent opacity overlies the lower thoracic spine
 corresponding to the right retrocardiac region on the PA view.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Additional patchy opacity in right
 lower lobe posteriorly may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
