                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with periampullary carcinoma and fevers,
 abdominal pain, evaluate for consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A single portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 6 a.m. is submitted. 
 There is overlying motion which does limit evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall, the lungs appear grossly clear with no evidence of focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia, although subtle area could be overlooked
 given the motion artifact.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, large pleural
 effusions, or large pneumothoraces.  Heart remains upper limits of normal in
 size given portable technique.  If the patient's symptoms persist, followup
 imaging should be considered given the technical limitations of this
 examination.
