                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and fevers, question consolidation in the
 lungs.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  The possibility of pneumonia in the lower
 lungs is therefore suboptimally assessed.  The mid to upper lungs appear well
 aerated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  The
 previously noted PICC line has been removed.  A drainage catheter projects
 over the right upper quadrant.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities and atelectasis, pneumonia difficult to
 exclude.  Interval removal of PICC line.
