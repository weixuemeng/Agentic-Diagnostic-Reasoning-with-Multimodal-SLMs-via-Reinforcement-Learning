                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the larger atelectasis at
 the right lung bases and the small atelectasis at the left lung bases are
 virtually unchanged.  In addition to these opacities, no additional changes to
 the lung parenchyma are noted.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains at
 the upper range of normal, but no pulmonary edema is appreciated.  Larger
 pleural effusions are not seen.
