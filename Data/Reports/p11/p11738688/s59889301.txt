 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the heart size.  Bibasilar streaky right
 greater than left opacities are likely atelectatic.  A nodular opacity
 projects over the spine in the lower field on lateral view only.  There is a
 trace right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Bibasilar right greater than left atelectasis with trace right-sided
 effusion.

 for further characterization.
