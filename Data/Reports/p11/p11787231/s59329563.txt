  No significant change compared with the exam performed the day prior, with
  bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema, vascular congestion and a small
  right-sided pleural effusion. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is a
  combination of oblique position and an enlarged superior vena cava likely due
  to increased right cardiac pressures and proven in chest CT from the previous
  day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening hypoxia  // Please assess for
 acute processes      Please assess for acute processes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Small bilateral pleural effusions with volume loss in the
 retrocardiac region. Again there is prominence of the upper mediastinum,
 consistent with a combination of obliquity of the patient and enlargement of
 the SVC as on the recent CT scan.
