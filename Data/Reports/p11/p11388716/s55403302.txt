 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, assess for pneumonia.  Also history of TCC
 of the bladder with metastatic disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Port-A-Cath resides
 over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending into the expected
 location of the superior vena cava.  The lungs are clear bilaterally without
 focal consolidation, effusion, or signs of pneumothorax.  Upper lobe lucency
 is compatible with known emphysema.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  There are old right rib cage deformities
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema without superimposed pneumonia.
