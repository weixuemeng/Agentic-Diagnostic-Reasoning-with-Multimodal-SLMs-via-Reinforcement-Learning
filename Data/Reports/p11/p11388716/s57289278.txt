 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and hypotension on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Persistent streaky opacity seen at
 the left lung base.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear of consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Right chest
 wall port is again seen with catheter tip in the upper SVC.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity as seen on prior could be related to atelectasis
 however superimposed acute infection is not excluded.  Clinical correlation
 suggested.
