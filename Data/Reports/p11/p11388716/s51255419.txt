                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CTA Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. 
 Streaky opacities within the lung bases bilaterally likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Previously noted right apical nodular opacity is no longer
 visualized, though this area on prior CT was noted to have emphysematous
 changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild streaky bibasilar atelectasis.
