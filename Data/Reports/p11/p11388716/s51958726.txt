                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cancer on chemotherapy, presenting with exertional
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the proximal
 to mid SVC.  Biapical scarring is seen.  There are subtle nodular opacity
 projecting over the right lung apex, which be slightly increased as compared
 to the prior study and which could relate to inflammatory infectious process. 
 No lower consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Further right upper lobe nodular opacity difficult to assess on this study,
 could relate to atypical inflammatory infectious process versus chronic
 changes.
