                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p RULobectomy  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the preoperative radiographs obtained 1 week prior, lung volumes
 are low, particularly on the right.  Clips projecting over the right hilum are
 new.  Adjacent hilar opacity is likely postsurgical.  A right chest tube is
 unremarkably positioned.   No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall and inferior right neck
 is new.  Low lung volumes accentuate a normal sized heart.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Expected postsurgical changes without radiographic evidence of significant
 immediate complication.
