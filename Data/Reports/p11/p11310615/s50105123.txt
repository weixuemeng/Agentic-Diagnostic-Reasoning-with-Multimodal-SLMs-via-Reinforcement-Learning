                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man who is postop day 3 after right upper lobectomy
 now presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had recent right upper lobectomy with expected elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm, right shift of the mediastinum/trachea and
 postoperative change including moderate subcutaneous emphysema along the right
 lateral chest wall extending into the right supraclavicular soft tissue,
 decreased in extent since ___.  Overall appearance of the right apex is
 similar to the prior exams on ___.  Expansion of the right lung is smaller
 from the most recent exam but similar to the exam earlier on ___ appears
 related to phase of respiration.  Surgical clips projecting in the mediastinum
 are unchanged.  No evidence of large pneumothorax.  Trace pleural effusions
 bilaterally are best appreciated on the lateral view.  The heart is probably
 top normal in size, unchanged.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications at the knob.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are mild-to-moderate.  Slight increased density
 overlapping the facet joints at the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view
 are similar to the PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___ and may
 reflect degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Expected postsurgical changes after right upper lobectomy.
 
 2.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
