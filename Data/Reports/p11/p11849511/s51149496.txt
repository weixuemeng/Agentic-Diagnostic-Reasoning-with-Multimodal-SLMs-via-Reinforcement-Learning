                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with fall and currently
 dyspnea and tachycardia with chest tube delivering 1.3 liters of
 serosanguineous white fluid on the left, re-assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are stable.  Left pleural effusion is re-demonstrated, at
 least moderate.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Right basal opacity appears to be
 minimally increased, most likely reflecting atelectasis.
