                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 9:20 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm
 from the carina.  Enteric tube passes off the inferior field of view. 
 Left-sided central venous catheter tracks along the left side of the
 mediastinum.  When correlated to chest CT from earlier the same day, there is
 no of left-sided SVC to possibly explain this course.  The line potentially
 could be within the internal mamillary vein.  Correlation with blood gas
 suggested to exclude arterial location.  Attempts with lateral view could also
 help clarify.  Remainder of the exam is unchanged.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ after
 examination was performed.
