                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory distress status post intubation
 and chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed earlier the same day at ___
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with
 tip approximately 5.7 cm from the carina.  Left-sided internal jugular line is
 seen with course projecting laterally and tip over the axillary region. 
 Enteric tube is seen passing below the diaphragm, although the tip is not
 clearly delineated and potentially off the inferior field of view.  Left-sided
 pleural catheter is identified at the lung base.  There is dense retrocardiac
 opacity which could be due to any combination of effusion, consolidation or
 infection.  Elsewhere, there is mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left-sided IJ central venous catheter with tip projecting over the axilla
 for which repositioning is suggested.
 2.  Dense left basilar opacity with pleural catheter in place.  This could be
 due to any combination of effusion, atelectasis or infection with superimposed
 bilateral pulmonary edema.
