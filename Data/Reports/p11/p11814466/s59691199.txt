                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right chest tube removal, evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 4:___ a.m., the right-sided chest tube has been
 removed.  A small right pneumothorax is now seen.  A right subclavian central
 line is again noted over the mid SVC.  
 
 There is diffuse hazy opacity throughout both lungs.  Slight obscuration of
 the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with right base atelectasis, may be
 accentuated by supine positioning.   On the right, air bronchograms are seen,
 suggesting an alveolar process, ? CHF or other pneumonic opacity.  Possible
 layering effusions.  Spinal fixation hardware is seen in the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax.  
 Dense alveolar opacities in both lungs. Possible  layering effusions.
