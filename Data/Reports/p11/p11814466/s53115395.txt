                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVC polytrauma and pulmonary contusion and now spinal fusion,
 question change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right subclavian central line tip over mid/lower SVC, unchanged.
 
 There are clips over the lower mid chest, in the midline.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Pulmonary hila appear prominent,
 with a tapered appearance.  There is opacity in both lungs, more pronounced at
 the lung bases, which could reflect pulmonary contusion. This is has improved
 slightly compared with 1 day earlier, particularly at the right base.  There
 is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small
 right effusion.  No left effusion is identified.  The previously identified
 right apical pneumothorax is not appreciated on the current examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval improvement in the right pneumothorax and slight interval clearing at
 the right lung base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
