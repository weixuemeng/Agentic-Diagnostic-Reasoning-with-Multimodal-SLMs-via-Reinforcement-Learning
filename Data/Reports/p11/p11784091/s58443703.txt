 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Areas of atelectasis are seen at both
 lung bases.  There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely caused
 by diaphragmatic eventration.  Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of
 mild-to-moderate fluid overload and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but no
 evidence of parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
