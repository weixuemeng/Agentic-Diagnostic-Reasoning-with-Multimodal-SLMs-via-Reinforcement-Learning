                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and the aorta is tortuous, both
 without change.  Lung volumes remain relatively low.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 within normal limits accounting for this factor.  Bibasilar areas of
 atelectasis are again demonstrated, slightly worse on the right and slightly
 improved on the left.  There remains moderate elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm anteriorly.  No substantial pleural effusion.  Diffusely
 distended loops of bowel are seen in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen,
 incompletely imaged on this chest radiograph exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Distended loops of bowel in imaged upper abdomen, for which dedicated
 abdominal radiographs may be helpful to distinguish ileus from obstruction if
 warranted clinically.
