                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT chest ___ at 15:59 chest radiograph ___ 12:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate but appears
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Mild pulmonary edema is new since
 the previous chest radiograph.  Confluent opacities are seen within the left
 mid lung field and left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.  Additional
 ill-defined nodular opacities are seen within the right lung compatible with
 small airways disease, better assessed on the previous CT.  Small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  A gastric lap band is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2. New mild pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion.
 3. Multifocal pneumonia, not substantially changed in the interval.
