                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachypnea  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is present.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  Mild upper zone vascular redistribution is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky right basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis,
 however infection cannot be completely excluded.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles bilaterally could be due to pleural thickening or trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is
 present.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Orthopedic hardware within the region of the right shoulder is not completely
 imaged on this examination.  Remote right-sided rib fracture is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy right basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis but infection
 is not completely excluded.
