                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, stenting within the
 coronary artery bypass grafts, and placement of a right-sided pacer device
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Moderate
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely
 calcified and tortuous. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is demonstrated
 along with small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities in both lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, although infection in the right
 lung base is not completely excluded. No definite pneumothorax is seen
 although assessment of the left apex is somewhat obscured by the patient's
 neck projecting over this region. There is no acute osseous abnormality. Dense
 vascular calcifications are noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection
 is not excluded in the right lung base in the correct clinical setting.
