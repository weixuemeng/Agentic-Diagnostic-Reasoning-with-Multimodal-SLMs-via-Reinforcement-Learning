                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx CAD s/p CABG, AAA repair presenting with epigastric
 pain, evaluate for pneumonia as etiology of epigastric pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a right chest pacer device in unchanged position with associated dual
 leads projecting over the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  Again
 seen is post CABG change with median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical
 clips.  There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged. 
 Diffusely increased interstitial prominence likely reflects mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects basilar
 atelectasis.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Left pleural effusion is small.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar atelectasis.  No focal lung consolidation.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Overall, stable chest radiograph.
