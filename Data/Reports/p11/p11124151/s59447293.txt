                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low. Faint bilateral nodules and peribronchial
 opacification are confirmed by images of the upper chest on the subsequent
 Cervical Spine CT. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild.  There may adenopathy in the
 paratracheal mediastinal stations.  The heart is not enlarged but exaggerated
 by low lung volumes and AP technique.  There is crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature but no pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia. Possible mediastinal adenopathy.
