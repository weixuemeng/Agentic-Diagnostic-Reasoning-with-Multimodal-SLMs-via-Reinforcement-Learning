 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen,
 with the exception of new bilateral small pleural effusions limited to the
 costophrenic sinuses.  The signs of mild fluid overload are unchanged. 
 Slightly increasing areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pneumothorax. 
 The lung volumes remain low.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
