                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax or rib fracture in a ___-year-old man
 status post cardiac arrest, now with return of spontaneous circulation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, approximately 3 hours prior,
 as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal semi upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube terminating in the upper thoracic trachea, enteric tube extending below
 the left hemidiaphragm, and a left chest wall pacer device with the lead
 overlying the right ventricle.  The heart remains enlarged.  Bilateral
 pulmonary opacities are compatible with pulmonary edema, similar to mildly
 increased.  However superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. There
 is no appreciable pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No appreciable pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.
 2. Pulmonary edema is similar to mildly increased.  However superimposed
 infection cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is continued concern for pneumothorax, short
 interval follow-up chest radiograph can be obtained.  If possible,
 inspiratory/expiratory radiographs can help to emphasize pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:40 PM, 5 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
