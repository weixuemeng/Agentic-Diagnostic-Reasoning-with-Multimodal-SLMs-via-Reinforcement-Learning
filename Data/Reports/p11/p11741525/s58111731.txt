                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:44 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea and shortness of breath after ambulating.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Right hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated.  Whether this is due to
 atelectasis or diaphragmatic dysfunction is radiographically indeterminate and
 would require functional imaging such as chest fluoroscopy or ultrasound of
 the diaphragm.
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, but there is no pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion
 is small if any.  Right upper lung and left lung are clear.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
