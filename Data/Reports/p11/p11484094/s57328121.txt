  IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate

  considered.  Followup radiographs are recommended to show resolution in the
  short-term.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.  Question pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta with calcifications seen along the aortic
 arch.  Otherwise, allowing for differences in technique, the mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are patchy opacities in the right
 upper lobe as well as in the left lower lobe, worrisome for multifocal
 pneumonia.  Areas of lung including the left upper lung appear spared without
 abnormality of the pulmonary vascularity.  Minor degenerative changes are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Other etiologies such as aspiration could also be
 considered.  Followup radiographs are recommended to show resolution in the
 short-term.
