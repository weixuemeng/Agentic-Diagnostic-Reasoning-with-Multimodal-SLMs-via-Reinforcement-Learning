                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  New fullness in the
 left hilus is suspected and potentially may reflect summation of shadows, but
 lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  Lungs are essentially clear with no
 evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Given the above-mentioned findings, assessment with chest CT, preferably with
 IV contrast is recommended to distinguish between summation of shadows versus
 lymphadenopathy in the left hilus.
