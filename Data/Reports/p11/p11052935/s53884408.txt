                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent diagnosis of pneumonia, worsening symptoms.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, PET-CT ___, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Hyperinflation of lungs
 with emphysematous changes , most pronounced within the lung apices is again
 demonstrated.  Ill-defined patchy opacity within the right lower lobe appears
 slightly improved when compared to the prior study, but persists. 
 Additionally, continued patchy ill-defined opacity within the left lower lobe
 is not significantly changed in the interval.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Scarring within the left upper lobe is stable.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in ill-defined patchy opacity within
 the right lower lobe likely representing pneumonia.  Patchy opacity in the
 left lower lobe may be reflective of atelectasis, though infection in this
 region also cannot be excluded, but appears relatively unchanged compared to
 the prior study.
