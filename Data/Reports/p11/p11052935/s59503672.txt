                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  As on prior, the lungs are hyperinflated with parenchymal
 changes suggestive of emphysema, particularly at the left lung apex. 
 Increased interstitial markings are identified at the left lung base. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
 Linear patchy at the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis versus
 scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings at the left lung base,
 potentially due to chronic changes; however, in the proper clinical setting,
 component of infection is also possible.  Two views of the chest may help
 further characterize.
