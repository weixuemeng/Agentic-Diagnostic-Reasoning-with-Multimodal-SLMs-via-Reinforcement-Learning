                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A new area of consolidation has developed in the left lower lobe,
 and is concerning for developing pneumonia considering the clinical suspicion
 for this entity.  Additional nonspecific patchy opacity at the periphery of
 the right lung base could reflect focal atelectasis, or an additional site of
 infection.  Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 evident.
