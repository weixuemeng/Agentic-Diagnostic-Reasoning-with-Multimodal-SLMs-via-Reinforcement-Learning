                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough.  Question
 pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs appear hyperexpanded, in keeping with
 known emphysema.  Previously seen left lower lobe opacity has resolved on the
 frontal view but may persist on lateral view obscuring the posterior
 costophrenic angle, which could represent a component of residual infection
 and/or atelectasis.  There is trace basilar atelectasis on the right.  There
 is no large effusion.  Eventration is seen on the right, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  Persistent probable left lower
 lobe posterior opacity which could represent atelectasis or a component of
 residual infection, to be clinically correlated.  Followup after treatment
 recommending to document resolution.
