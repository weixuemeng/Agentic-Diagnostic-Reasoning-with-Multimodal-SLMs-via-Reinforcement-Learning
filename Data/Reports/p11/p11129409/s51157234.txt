                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS wedge/pleurodesis  // ?PTX
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, the patient has undergone left apical
 wedge resection with development of a small left apical pneumothorax with
 indwelling chest tube.  New consolidative opacities in the left mid and lower
 lung could represent aspiration and less likely hemorrhage or atelectasis.
 Right lung is remarkable for linear atelectasis.  Mild gastric distension is
 also demonstrated.
