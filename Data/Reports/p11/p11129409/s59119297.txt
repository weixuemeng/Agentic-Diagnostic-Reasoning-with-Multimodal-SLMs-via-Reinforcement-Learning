                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L VATS blebectomy w/ pleurodesis, ct to
 suction  // eval for ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:57
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Chain sutures are noted at the left lung apex and a left-sided chest tube is
 present. No well-defined pneumothorax is identified. The possibility of a tiny
 residual pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Again seen is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse
 and/or consolidation. Probable slight improvement in the more nodular
 opacities seen at the left base laterally. Probable small left effusion,
 unchanged.
 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base again noted. No new focal opacity
 detected. The right lung and costophrenic angle is otherwise grossly clear.
 
 Mild gastric distention again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No obvious pneumothorax. Left-greater-than-right opacities again seen, with
 slight interval improvement at the left base.
