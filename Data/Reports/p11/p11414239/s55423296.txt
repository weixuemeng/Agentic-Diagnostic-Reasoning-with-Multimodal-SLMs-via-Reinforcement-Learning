 HISTORY:  Two weeks of increased falls, ataxia, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of
 underlying COPD.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are minimal streaky
 bibasilar atelectatic changes.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present. 
 Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Probable COPD.
