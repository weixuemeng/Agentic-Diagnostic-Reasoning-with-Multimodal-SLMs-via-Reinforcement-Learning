                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Trauma and repositioning of chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Small quantities
 of subcutaneous emphysema are noted in soft tissues overlying the site of
 insertion of a chest tube into the left hemithorax.  It has been pulled back
 somewhat but appropriately projects over the mid hemithorax, making a turn
 beyond the side holemarker.  No detectable pneumothorax remains in the left
 hemithorax.  Minimal opacification of the left lower lung is probably due to
 minor atelectasis.  The right lung remains clear.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion.  Left-sided rib fractures are not well characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chest tube projecting over the left hemithorax. Small quantity of subcutaneous
 emphysema but no residual pneumothorax identified.
