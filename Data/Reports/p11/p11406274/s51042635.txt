 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Influenza and superinfection, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The edema component of the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities has decreased in extent and severity.  The
 ill-defined parenchymal opacities, reflecting pneumonia, and more severe on
 the right than on the left, are unchanged as compared to the previous
 examination.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.
