                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac
 silhouette is slightly less prominent and there may be some improvement in the
 degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is ill-defined area of
 increased opacification in the left perihilar region.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could reflect a developing consolidation.
 
 Central catheter remains in place.
