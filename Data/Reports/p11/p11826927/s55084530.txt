                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison to chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest also from that same
 day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension and sepsis, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  The lungs are
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Clips are noted in the right axilla.  The heart size is normal.  There is an
 unusual configuration of the mediastinum which is stable from prior exams and
 likely reflects the extensive collateral vessels due to known left subclavian
 and brachiocephalic venous stenosis.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
