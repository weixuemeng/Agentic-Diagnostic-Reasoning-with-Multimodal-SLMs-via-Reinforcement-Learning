 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS

 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear, although it would be
 difficult to exclude small nodules with radiography.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
