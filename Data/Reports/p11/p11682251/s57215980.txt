                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 perihilar opacities suggest mild vascular engorgement.  However, there is
 subtle patchy opacity over the right upper hemithorax, and underlying
 infection at this location is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar with the cardiac
 silhouette mildly enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy lateral right upper lung opacity could be due to
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  Perihilar haziness may be due
 to mild fluid overload.
