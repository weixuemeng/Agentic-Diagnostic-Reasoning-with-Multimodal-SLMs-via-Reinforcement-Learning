                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Non-verbal.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is at the upper
 limits of normal size.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Air bronchograms can be seen in the medial retrocardiac region which may
 indicate a subtle left lower lobe opacity.  The right humerus shows apparent
 inferior positioning compared to the glenoid consistent with chronic
 dislocation not significantly changed since earlier studies.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Medial left basilar opacity suggested by vague opacity with air
 bronchograms, but not well evaluated.  Atelectasis but potentially pneumonia
 could be considered, although this finding is not a definite source for
 infection.
