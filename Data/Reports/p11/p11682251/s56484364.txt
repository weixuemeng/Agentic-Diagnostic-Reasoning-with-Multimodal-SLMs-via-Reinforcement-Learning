                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage dementia, increased work of breathing, and hypoxia. 
 Concern for pneumonia versus aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates Diffuse faint
 symmetric opacifications; in setting of slight interval increase size of
 cardiac silhoutette as well as a more prominet azygous vein, findings likely
 represent early fluid overload.  Hilar contours are unchanged.   No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint diffuse bilateral lung opacification in setting of
 increased cardiomegaly and prominent central vessels suggests early fluid
 overload.
