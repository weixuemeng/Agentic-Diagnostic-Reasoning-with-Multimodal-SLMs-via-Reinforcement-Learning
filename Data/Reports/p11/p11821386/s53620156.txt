                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___  
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  No acute, displaced rib fractures evident on this
 chest radiograph examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 obvious rib fracture.  If strong clinical suspicion for rib fracture persists,
 dedicated rib films may be considered with marker at site of point tenderness.
