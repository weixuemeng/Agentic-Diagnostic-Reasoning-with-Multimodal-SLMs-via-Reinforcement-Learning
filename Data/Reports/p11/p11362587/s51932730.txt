                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremia with wheezing, to assess for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 more prominent, probably reflecting in large part the AP supine versus the
 previous PA upright technique.  There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary
 vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Hazy opacification at
 the bases could reflect some free pleural fluid.
 
 The possibility of supervening pneumonia, especially at the bases, would be
 difficult to exclude.
