 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pulmonary edema has
 shifted into the mediastinal space, as expressed by fluid markings of the
 interlobar fissures, presence of small pleural effusions as well as of
 substantial peribronchial cuffing.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 constant.  No focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.  Unchanged
 appearance of the mediastinal structures.
