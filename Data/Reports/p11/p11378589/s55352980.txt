                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach,
 then coils back on itself so that the tip of the opaque portion overlies the
 lower portion of the eleventh posterior rib.  The suggested increased
 opacification at the bases, especially on the right, is not definitely
 appreciated.  This could reflect either clearing of aspiration or improved
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 An initial image from this study showed the tip of the Dobbhoff tube in the
 lower esophagus, but this was corrected on the subsequent image.
