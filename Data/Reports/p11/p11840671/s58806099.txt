                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Linear calcifications along the anterior pleura within the left hemithorax
 likely reflect pleural plaques, and probably account for the 2.0 x 3.7cm
 rounded opacity projecting over the left ___ anterior rib.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Calcified pleural plaques, likely
 accounting for the rounded opacity projecting over the left 5th rib
 anteriorly.
