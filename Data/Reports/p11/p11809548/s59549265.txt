                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Congestive change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Patient is status post sternotomy.  Allowing for this, there is mild
 cardiomegaly.  Slight lucency of the left lung is noted, probably rotational.
 
 Air projected over the central neck is presumptively within the hypopharynx.
 
 There is minimally increased lung markings on the right side with
 peribronchial cuffing, but overall there are no good changes of large CHF as
 suggested on the clinical form.
 
 The lateral chest radiograph shows some multilevel compression fractures of
 the thoracic spine and osteopenia.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Relatively minor congestive changes, asymmetrically involving the
 right lung.  No significant additional changes.
