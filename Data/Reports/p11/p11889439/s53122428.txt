 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion

 which is likely secondary to gastric distention with adjacent left basilar
 atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation.   
 Sternotomy wires are intact and surgical clips overlying the left thorax are
 consistent with prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
