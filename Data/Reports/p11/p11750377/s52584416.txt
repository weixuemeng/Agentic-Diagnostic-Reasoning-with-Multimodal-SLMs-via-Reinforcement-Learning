                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fevers and cough.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The right lung is clear. In the
 lateral view there is an ill-defined opacity blunting the costophrenic angle
 without a clear fluid meniscus to account for pleural effusion in this side. 
 There is no pleural effusion in the right either.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 With the exception of stable moderate cardiomegaly and minimal aortic
 tortuosity, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable consolidation in the left lower lobe only seen in the
 lateral view might represent atelectasis although a focus of pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
