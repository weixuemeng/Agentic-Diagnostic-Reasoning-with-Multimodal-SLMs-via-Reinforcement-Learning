                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Overlying soft tissue limits fine detail. 
 Within this limitation, there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  There is minimal pulmonary edema, better seen on the
 subsequent ultrasound.  The cardiac silhouette remains massively enlarged. The
 hilar structures are grossly unremarkable.
