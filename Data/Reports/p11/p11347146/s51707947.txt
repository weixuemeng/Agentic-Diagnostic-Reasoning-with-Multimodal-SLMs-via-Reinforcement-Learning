                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and positioning. Heart size may
 be mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. 
 Right lung is clear.  There may be patchy opacification in the left lung base.
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized, although the osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Possible patchy opacity in the left lung base, which could
 reflect atelectasis.  Further assessment with dedicated PA and lateral views
 if the patient is able to would be beneficial for improved assessment of the
 lung bases.
