                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right subclavian line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian central venous catheter tip is malpositioned, coursing across
 the midline, and tip likely within the left subclavian vein.  The endotracheal
 tube has been withdrawn, with tip now terminating approximately 5 cm from the
 carina.  Enteric tube remains in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis,
 but aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Malpositioned right subclavian central venous catheter with tip likely in
 the left subclavian vein.
 2. Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, now in standard position.
