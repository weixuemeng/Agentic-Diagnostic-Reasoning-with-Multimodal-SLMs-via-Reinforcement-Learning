                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with status epilepticus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying, at the level of the carina and approaching the
 right mainstem bronchus.  Enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is demonstrated.  The
 aorta appears tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Apparent
 widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and
 low lung volumes.  Linear and streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  The
 stomach demonstrates mild gaseous distention.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip at the carina, approaching the right mainstem
 bronchus orifice and should be retracted by approximately 5cm.
 2. Enteric tube tip within the stomach.
 3. Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis though
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
