                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleuritic chest / flank pain  // evaluate for
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Right paratracheal soft tissues could represent vascular structures in someone
 of this age.  Slight leftward displacement of the trachea is noted.  While
 this could be positional, it raises the possibility of displacement by the
 thyroid.
 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal in size.  The aorta is unfolded.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  No free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process detected.
 2. Possible leftward displacement of the trachea.  If real, this raises the
 question of displacement by an enlarged right thyroid.  Prominent right
 paratracheal soft tissues may be related to this or could be related to
 ectatic vessels in someone of this age.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation requested regarding possible
 displacement of the trachea, which could reflect enlargement of the right
 thyroid.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings related to the trachea/thyroid were emailed to the ED
 QA nurses at 12:09 on ___ by Dr. ___.
