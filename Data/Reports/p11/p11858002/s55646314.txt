                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear without lobar consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Mild linear opacity at the right
 lung base extending towards the hilum likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Irregular calcification projecting over the left upper lung
 field may reflect calcified pleural plaques.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable in appearance.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragm.
 No displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable linear right lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
