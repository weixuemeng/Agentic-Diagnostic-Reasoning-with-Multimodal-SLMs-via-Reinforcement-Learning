                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, intubated.  Assess endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Right IJ central
 venous catheter is in the mid SVC.  The tip of the enteric tube is just beyond
 the GE junction and needs to be advanced.  Pacemaker leads are appropriately
 positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 There are dense diffuse bilateral interstitial and probably also alveolar
 opacities, including some denser opacities along the right chest wall. The
 appearance in the right chest may also reflct a  moderate layering right 
 effusion is present. The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be
 excluded.  The cardiomediastinal borders are obscured by the pulomary
 opacities, but appears moderately enlarged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegally. 
 2.  Dense diffuse bilateral opacities.  The differential diagnosis includes
 pulmonary interstitial edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 severe atypical pneumonia and inflammatory causes of infiltrates are also in
 the differential.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is also in the differential, in the
 appropriate context.
 3.  Suspected moderate right pleural effusion.
 4.  Endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 The right internal jugular venous catheter is in the mid SVC.  NG tube is just
 beyond the GE junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
