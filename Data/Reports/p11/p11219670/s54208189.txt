                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p L thoracentesis
 yesterday  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. A left
 pectoral AICD remains in place.  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates
 in the low SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. A
 nasogastric tube can only be traced to the level of the mid esophagus. 
 Visualization is likely limited by exam technique and the patient's body
 habitus.  A left basilar pigtail catheter remains in place. Lung volumes are
 very low, but there is no appreciable change in small layering pleural
 effusions and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 also unchanged. Cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral
 pleural effusions, and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
