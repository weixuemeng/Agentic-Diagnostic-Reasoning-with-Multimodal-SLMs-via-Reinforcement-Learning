                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with possible pneumonia  // ? pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in TECHNIQUE and lung volumes, there has been little
 change in the appearance of the chest since the recent radiograph except for
 worsening opacification at the right lung base.  Although possibly due to a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion, developing pneumonia should also be
 considered given clinical suspicion for this entity.
