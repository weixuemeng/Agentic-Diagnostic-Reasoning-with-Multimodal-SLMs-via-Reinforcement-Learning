  Enteric tube terminates within the stomach. Left ventricular pacer and single
  lead is in standard position. Right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC as
  before.
  
  Low lung volumes. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema may be minimally increased
  from the prior study however bronchovascular markings are accentuated due to
  low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are again demonstrated in could
  represent atelectasis or infection.
