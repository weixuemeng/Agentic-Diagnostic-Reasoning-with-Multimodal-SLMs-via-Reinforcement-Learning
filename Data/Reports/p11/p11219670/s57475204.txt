                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ necrotizing pancreatitis  // Confirm dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Compare prior study from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Study is very limited due to patient's body habitus and technique.  However,
 the feeding tube appears to be within the lower esophagus. This could be
 advanced several cm for optimal placement. Would recommend obtaining abdominal
 films further evaluation. There is markedly low lung volumes which limits
 evaluation of lung fields.
