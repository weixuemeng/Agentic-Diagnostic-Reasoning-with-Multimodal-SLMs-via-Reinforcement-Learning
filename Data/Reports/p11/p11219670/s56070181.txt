 change      ?interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. Again there is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with ste significant bilateral pleural effusions, more
 prominent on the left, and underlying basilar atelectasis.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema is again seen.
 In view of the extensive pleural and parenchymal changes, it would be
 impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
