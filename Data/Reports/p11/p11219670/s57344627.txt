                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilat pleural effusions  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided cardiac AICD is partially imaged. The patient has had prior
 median sternotomy with valve replacement. A tracheostomy tube remains in
 place. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the low SVC. Lung volumes are
 low, and there is no appreciable change in left lung airspace opacities most
 likely corresponding to pulmonary edema. Left basilar is retrocardiac airspace
 opacification is most likely due to stable left lower lobe subsegmental
 atelectasis. Right lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly
 despite the projection is unchanged. A small layering left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in mild pulmonary edema, left basilar
 subsegmental atelectasis, right lower lobe collapse and a small layering left
 pleural effusion.
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
