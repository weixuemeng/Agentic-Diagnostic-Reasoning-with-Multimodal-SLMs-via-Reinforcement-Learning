                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT  // ?interval change
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, similar to ___. Pulmonary vessel congestion is
 slightly improved.  There is persistent bibasilar opacities which is probably
 due to lung base atelectasis and pleural effusions.
 NG tube appears to terminate in mid esophagus. ET tube terminates 5.6 cm above
 the carina. Left pectoral pacemaker has its leads terminating in right
 ventricle. There is a tube projecting over left hemidiaphragm. Prosthetic
 heart valve and sternotomy wires are unchanged. Right internal jugular venous
 catheter terminates at mid to low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. NG tube appears to terminate in mid esophagus, although the study is
 limited by overlying soft tissue. For better evaluation, consider obtaining
 radiograph of lower chest and upper abdomen using abdominal technique.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vessel congestion is slightly improved.
