                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with small bowel obstruction status post nasogastric
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous with prominence of the ascending
 aortic contour. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. Nasogastric tube tip is within the stomach. Several clips are noted
 in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen compatible with prior
 cholecystectomy. Spiral tacks overlying the midline upper abdomen are
 compatible prior ventral hernia repair. Unchanged posttraumatic deformity of
 the left fourth rib is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nasogastric tube tip in the stomach.
 2. Prominence of the ascending aortic contour. Consider chest CTA on a
 non-urgent basis to assess for aneurysm.
