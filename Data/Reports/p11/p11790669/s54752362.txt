                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with tracheostomy cannula that became
 dislodged and was put back during examination interval.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The tracheal cannula
 is in midline position, seen to terminate in the trachea.  Termination point
 is similar as it was before.  The on previous examination identified
 paratracheal air and subcutaneous air in the left lower neck region,
 indicative of pneumomediastinum at that time, cannot be seen anymore.  No
 pneumothoraces present.  Heart size unchanged.  The previously existing
 pulmonary congestive pattern and bilateral basal parenchymal infiltrates have
 regressed markedly.  No new abnormalities are seen.  A remaining diffuse haze
 on the left base is indicative for some pleural effusion layering posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable position of tracheostomy cannula, previously identified
 pneumomediastinum has disappeared.  No pneumothorax.
