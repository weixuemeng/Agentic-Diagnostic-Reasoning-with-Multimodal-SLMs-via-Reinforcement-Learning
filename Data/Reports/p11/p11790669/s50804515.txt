                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with new tracheostomy, evaluation for pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New tracheostomy is in adequate position ending 5.3 cm above carina.  There
 are, however, new small radiolucencies on the left side of the trachea could
 be compatible with new pneumomediastinum.  The tracheal wall is well seen
 throughout those radiolucencies so it is less likely an inflated balloon. 
 There is also some subcutaneous air in left lower neck.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis, consolidation and mild pleural effusion
 are unchanged.  Right Port-A-Cath is in adequate position.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 New tracheostomy is in adequate position.  However, there are new small
 radiolucencies on the left side of the trachea that could represent
 pneumomediastinum. 
 
 Followup chest x-ray is suggested in a few hours.  Dr. ___ in the ICU has
 been verbally contacted for the results.
