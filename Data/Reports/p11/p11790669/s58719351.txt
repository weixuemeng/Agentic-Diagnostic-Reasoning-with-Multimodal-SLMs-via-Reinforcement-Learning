                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypopharyngeal cancer, admitted for
 chemo complicated by sepsis and CVA, now rhonchorous and dyspneic, question
 CHF.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There are bilateral layering pleural effusions and residual patchy
 airspace opacity in the left upper lobe, left middle lung and at both bases. 
 These findings may reflect pneumonia.  There is likely a superimposed
 component of mild interstitial edema as well.  Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged
 in position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable, although the left heart border is somewhat
 obscured by the overlying effusion.
