 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent hospitalization at ___ for
 possible pneumonia  // cough, f/u pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear without focal consolidations.  There is a
 single, approximately 4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the posterior lungs
 only appreciated on lateral view.  Heart size is normal and cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormalities.
 Small nodular opacity described above is likely a spinous process tip in this
 projection, but cannot rule out a pulmonary nodule.  Recommend oblique
 radiographs for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend oblique radiographs of the chest for further
 evaluation of the nodular opacity described above.
