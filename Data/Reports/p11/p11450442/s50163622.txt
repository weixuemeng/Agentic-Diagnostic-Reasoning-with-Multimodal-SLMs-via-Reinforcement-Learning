                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___F with PNA, right IJ central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to same day radiographs
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which
 ends in the proximal right atrium, it would need to be withdrawn ___-15mm to
 end in the low SVC. A lucency at the right lung apex, likely represents a skin
 fold with a tiny apical pneumothorax also possible, attention on followup
 imaging.  An endotracheal tube has been retracted and is in appropriate
 position. Lung volumes are improved. There remain bibasilar opacities. There
 is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which ends in the
 proximal right atrium,  would need to be withdrawn ___-15 mm to end in the low
 SVC.
 2. Lucency at the right lung apex likely represents a skin fold but a tiny
 apical pneumothorax is possible, attention to this area on followup imaging.
 3. Retraction of endotracheal tube, now in appropriate position.
 4. Improved lung volumes compared to prior.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 09:46, 5 minutes after they were made.
