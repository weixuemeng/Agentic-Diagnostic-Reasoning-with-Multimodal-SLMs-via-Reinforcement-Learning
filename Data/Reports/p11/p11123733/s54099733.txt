                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of decubitus ulcers.  Please evaluate for infiltrate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is overall stable compared to the prior exam. Median
 sternotomy wires, clips and tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring are again noted.
 There has been interval increase in the moderate left pleural effusion and a
 persistent right effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable. 
 
 IMPRESSION :
 
 Interval increase in moderate left effusion and grossly unchanged right 
 effusion with adjacent opacities likely secondary to comperessive atelectasis,
 however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
