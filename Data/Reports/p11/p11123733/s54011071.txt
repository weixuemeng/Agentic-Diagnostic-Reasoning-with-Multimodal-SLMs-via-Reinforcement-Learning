 areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  These atelectasis are proportional to
 the effusions and larger on the left than on the right.  Mild fluid overload
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  In the well distended lung regions, there is no
 evidence for the presence of pneumonia.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
