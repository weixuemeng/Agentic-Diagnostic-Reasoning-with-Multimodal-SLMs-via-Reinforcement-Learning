 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been removed.  The pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in
 extent but remain clearly visible on both the frontal and the lateral
 radiograph.  The effusions are of moderate severity.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, but there is no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax, pneumonia.  Atelectasis at both lung bases persist.
