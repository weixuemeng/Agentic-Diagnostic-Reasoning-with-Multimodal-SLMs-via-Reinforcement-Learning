                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, right lower quadrant crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta appears mildly tortuous
 and diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities within the bases, potentially
 atelectasis, however early infection cannot be excluded.
