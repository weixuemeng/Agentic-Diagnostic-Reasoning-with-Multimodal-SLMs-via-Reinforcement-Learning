 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube is in the stomach.  Right PICC is at the lower SVC/cavoatrial
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are a
 combination of effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  Vascular congestion has worsened.
