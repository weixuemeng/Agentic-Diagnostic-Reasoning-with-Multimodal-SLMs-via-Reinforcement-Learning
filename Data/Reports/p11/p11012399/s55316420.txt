                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pacer leads, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Transvenous pacemaker leads are in
 standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Bilateral effusions are
 small with adjacent atelectases.  There are mild-to-moderate degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.  In the lateral view, increasing opacities in
 one of the lower lobes, likely the right, could be atelectasis.  Followup is
 recommended to exclude developing infection.
