 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:31 AM
  
  
  Tip of the right Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Opacity
  at the right cardiophrenic angle represents atelectasis.  Additional bilateral
  patchy opacities, predominantly in a subpleural distribution, have progressed
  from ___, better characterized by the concurrent chest CTA.  Small
  right pleural effusion.  No pleural effusion on the left.  No pneumothorax. 
  Known multiple bilateral rib fractures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with APML  // with worsening R rib pain, hx of
 fractures on the same, please evaluate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, heart has slightly increased
 in size and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema. 
 Nonspecific multifocal patchy opacities in the mid and lower lung have been
 more fully characterized by separately dictated CTA of the chest performed the
 same date.  Small right pleural effusion is not slightly increased compared to
 the prior study, and note is again made of subacute rib fractures.
