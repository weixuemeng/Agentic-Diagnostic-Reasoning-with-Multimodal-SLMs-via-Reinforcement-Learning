                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral crackles, evaluate for
 CHF or infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding single chest view examination of ___ as well as an
 older PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  There is moderate
 cardiac enlargement, the configuration indicative of left ventricular
 prominence.  Thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated but no local
 contour abnormalities are identified.  Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an
 upper zone re-distribution pattern suggestive of some increased left-sided
 filling pressure, but there is no evidence of overt interstitial or alveolar
 edema.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinus remain free from any fluid
 accumulation.  Similar as noted on two previous examinations, there is a
 moderate elevation of the right-sided diaphragm which results in some crowded
 appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the right lung base.  There is,
 however, no evidence of any acute parenchymal infiltrate.  No pneumothorax is
 seen in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate mild
 degree of S-shaped scoliosis with moderate degenerative changes, but no
 evidence of any acute vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild degree of chronic pulmonary congestion, chronic elevation of
 right-sided diaphragm with thereto related crowded appearance of vasculature
 but no evidence of acute infiltrates, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax in
 this elderly female patient.
