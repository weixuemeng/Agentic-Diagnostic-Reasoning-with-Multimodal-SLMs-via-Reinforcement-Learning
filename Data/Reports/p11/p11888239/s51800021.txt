 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new.  Right middle and right
 lower lobe atelectasis has slightly worsened, with persistent adjacent
 elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  Slight improvement in left retrocardiac
 opacity, likely due to atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 No visible pneumothorax.
