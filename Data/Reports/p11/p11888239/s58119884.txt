 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a worsening area of opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region, which could potentially be due to aspiration given the history of
 clinical suspicion for this entity.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for right
 lower lobe atelectasis, moderate elevation of right hemidiaphragm, and an
 apparent calcified granuloma in the left lung apex.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.
