                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is
 persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, which could be due to a small effusion.  There are
 questionable subtle rib deformities along the lateral fifth and sixth ribs of
 indeterminate age, correlate with history of trauma.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not assessed but is likely top normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Mild prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature is likely at least in part due to low lung volumes.
