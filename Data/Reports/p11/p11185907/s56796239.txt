                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest tube  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:39 and targeted review of
 chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:39 and targeted review of chest CT from ___.
 
 Again seen are multiple left-sided rib fractures and a pigtail catheter at the
 left lung base.  There is a small left effusion with minimal atelectasis at
 the left base.  There is a small to moderate size pneumothorax seen at the
 left lung base against the lower left chest wall and, on lateral view, seen
 anteriorly.  Minimal lucency along the left mediastinum could also be due to
 the pneumothorax.
 
 The mediastinum remains midline, unchanged in configuration.
 
 On the right, there is a small effusion, with minimal right basilar
 atelectasis.  There is relative lucency along the right chest laterally. 
 Unless there is reason to suspect a right-sided pneumothorax, there is most
 likely represents artifact due to overlying soft tissue contours.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 There is background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
 
 Of note, there is a 4.1 mm nodule in the right mid/lower zone laterally, which
 corresponds to the nodule described on the ___ CT scan for which
 repeat chest CT in ___ months is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pigtail catheter at left lung base, with small pleural effusion, minimal
 basilar atelectasis, and small to moderate-size pneumothorax.  The effusion
 appears slightly larger.  As the bulk of the pneumothorax is seen only on the
 lateral view, comparison to the most recent prior study is limited.
 
 Left-sided rib fractures again noted.
 
 Small right pleural effusion and minimal atelectasis at right base, unchanged.
 
 Lucency at right lateral lung base.  Unless there is reason to suspect a
 right-sided pneumothorax, this most likely represents artifact due to
 overlying soft tissue contours.  If there is concern for right-sided
 pneumothorax, then an additional frontal view obtained at end- expiration of
 the respiratory cycle could help for further assessment.
 
 Pulmonary nodule in the right mid/lower right lung, also seen on the recent CT
 scan.  As suggested on the chest CT report, repeat chest CT in ___ months is
 recommended.
 
 Background COPD.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If there is concern for right-sided pneumothorax, then an
 additional frontal view obtained at end- expiration of the respiratory cycle
 could help for further assessment.
 
 Pulmonary nodule in the right mid/lower right lung. As suggested on the report
 for the recent chest CT, repeat chest CT in ___ months is recommended.
