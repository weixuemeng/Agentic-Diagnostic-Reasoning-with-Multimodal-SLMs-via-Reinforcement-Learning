 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 07:44 is submitted. Please

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains stably enlarged.  Both lungs are overall hyperinflated
 consistent with underlying emphysema.  Pulmonary arteries are prominent
 raising the possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  More
 focal nodular opacity at the right lung base is unchanged and may reflect a
 nipple shadow as no corresponding abnormality is seen in this location on the
 CT dated ___.There is a stable left-sided apical pneumothorax.  Left
 chest tube remains in place with subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral
 chest wall.  A left pleural effusion with retrocardiac consolidation is
 unchanged. Left-sided multiple posterolateral rib fractures are again seen. 
 No pulmonary edema.
