 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax unchanged.  Moderately extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema left chest wall may have improved.  No appreciable left pleural
 effusion.  Apparent heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lobe could
 be due in part to overlying soft tissue but raises concern for early
 pneumonia.  Careful followup advised.  Right lung hyperinflated due to
 emphysema, clear of any focal abnormality.  Heart size normal.  Displaced left
 rib fractures noted, unchanged.
