 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F mech fall 4 steps at 5AM +HS -___ w/ possible C1
 lateral mass fx and L rib fxs ___ w/ L tension PTX s/p L CT placement  //
 -dc'ed chest tube ?pneumo,Please do at 1:30 am

 The small right pleural effusion persists.  No definite right-sided
 pneumothorax detected, though the lucency at the right lung base remains

 not clearly represent a pneumothorax.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis and/or
 scarring at both bases again noted.
 
 Nodular density at the right mid/lower zone laterally is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of left pigtail catheter.  Small residual pneumothorax, with
