                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left ptx chest tube to water seal  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to earlier same day, a residual left pneumothorax is seen anteriorly,
 with additional small areas of lucency about the upper left lung and left lung
 base.  However, the left pneumothorax appears significantly smaller compared
 with earlier the same day.  The small left pleural effusion is essentially
 unchanged.
 
 Area of relative lucency at the right lung base is again noted, question
 artifact.  As before, pneumothorax is considered less likely,  but if it
 remains a clinical concern, then additional imaging with low inspiratory
 volume films could be obtained.
 
 Again seen is the pigtail catheter at the left lung base and multiple
 left-sided rib fractures.  No CHF and no new focal consolidation is
 identified.  The small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 The right lung nodule remains visible.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left pneumothorax remains present, but is smaller.
 
 Lucency at right lung base again noted - please see comment above.
