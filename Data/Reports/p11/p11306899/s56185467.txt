                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Odynophagia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  There are
 bibasilar opacities which may be due to atelectasis, although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is a
 thin tubular structure projecting over the lateral right lower hemithorax. 
 The exact course is difficult to assess on this study but appears to
 potentially curve along the posterior right chest on the lateral view.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 There may be small pleural effusions, but large pleural effusion is not seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
