                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural catheter, no drainage, question position.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-rays from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, a catheter overlies the right lung base.  Its
 contour has changed slightly, although the tip, as before, appears to overlie
 the lung base, adjacent to the spine.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion, similar, perhaps slightly smaller, than on the prior film.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is some patchy opacity at the right base, with sutures in the right
 mid zone and some nearby irregular linear opacity. 
 Also again seen is borderline cardiomegaly, sternotomy wires, prosthetic
 valve, a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and
 suggestion of some background chronic lung changes.  
 
 Right PICC line tip is again seen at the SVC/RA junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle change in contour of the catheter at the right lung base. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
