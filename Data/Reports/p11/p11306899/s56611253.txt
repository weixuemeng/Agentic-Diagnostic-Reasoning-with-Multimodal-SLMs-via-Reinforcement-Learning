                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 abdominal surgery.  Sternal wires are in unchanged alignment.  There is
 evidence of valvular replacement.  The drain is overlying the left hemithorax.
 The lung volumes have decreased, with newly appeared atelectatic areas at both
 lung bases.  In addition, there is mild blunting of the right costophrenic
 sinus, likely reflecting the presence of a small right pleural effusion. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
