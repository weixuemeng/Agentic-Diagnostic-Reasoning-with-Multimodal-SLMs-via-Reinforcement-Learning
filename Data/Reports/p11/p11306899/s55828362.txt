                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following right thoracentesis, a right pleural effusion has
 decreased in size with only a small residual effusion remaining, and no
 visible pneumothorax.  Residual patchy and linear atelectasis is present at
 the right lung base adjacent to surgical chain sutures.  Within the left lung,
 marked worsening of left retrocardiac opacity is present, likely a combination
 of atelectasis and effusion, although aspiration and infectious consolidation
 are additional considerations.
