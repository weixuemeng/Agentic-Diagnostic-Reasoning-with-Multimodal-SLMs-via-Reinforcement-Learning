                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pacemaker placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker has been placed with its tip terminating in the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  There is no substantial change in
 the cardiomegaly.  There is substantial interval improvement up to complete
 resolution of pulmonary edema.  Still present small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted.  There is no definite pneumothorax seen, but minimal
 amount of apical pleural air cannot be excluded.
