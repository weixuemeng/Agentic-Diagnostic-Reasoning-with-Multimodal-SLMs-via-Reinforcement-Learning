 HISTORY:  Position of balloon catheter and degree of pulmonary congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is diffuse, relatively symmetric
 opacifications bilaterally consistent with substantial pulmonary edema related
 to the patient's noncardiogenic shock.  Right IJ catheter extends to the mid
 portion of the SVC.  The tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump lies just above
 the left main stem bronchus.
