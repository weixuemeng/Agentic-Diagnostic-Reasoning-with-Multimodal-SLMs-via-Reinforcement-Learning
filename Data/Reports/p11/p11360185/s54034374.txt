                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dyspnea after IV fluids, evaluate
 for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.
 
 The heart size remains unchanged and thus is within normal limits.  No typical
 configurational abnormalities identified.  Unchanged and unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta without evidence of local contour abnormalities
 or advanced wall calcifications.  In comparison with the previous examination,
 the pulmonary vasculature appears more distended.  Specifically, the
 vasculature in the upper area is compatible with so-called upper zone
 distribution.  There is some degree of perivascular haze in the basal mid
 portions of the lung, in particular on the left side, resulting in some
 diffuse parenchymal haze, resembles central pulmonary edema.  The lateral
 pleural sinuses are mildly blunted, but there are no larger amounts of pleural
 effusions as the posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  No pneumothorax is
 seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  Again, there is no evidence of
 local discrete pulmonary pneumonic infiltrate anywhere in the lung.
 
 The described changes can possibly be explained by very large amounts of IV
 fluids and a followup chest examination with relatively short interval should
 result in regression of the pulmonary vascular changes.  The patient's renal
 function is intact.  It should be realized that the described beginning
 central parenchymal changes in the left hemithorax cannot completely exclude
 the possibility of inflammatory infiltrates.
