                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ hx of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma of the left now w/
 metastatic myxoid liposarcoma to the left lung, s/p bronchoscopy and left VATS
 ___, s/p L pneumonectomy on ___ c/b hemothorax  // eval for interval
 change    eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs following left pneumonectomy, ___
 through ___ at 10:52.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive rightward mediastinal shift suggests accumulation of fluid and/or
 air under pressure in the left pneumonectomy space, although the volume of
 fluid does not appear to have appreciably changed.  Findings point toward
 bleeding or chylothorax, and also possible stump leak.
 
 Right lung is clear.  Size of the heart, with the left border obscured, is
 indeterminate, but there is no reason to suspect it is enlarged.
 
 Right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.
