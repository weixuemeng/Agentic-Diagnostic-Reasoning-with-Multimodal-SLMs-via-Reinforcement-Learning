 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CAD s/p 2 stents, T2DM, liposarcoma of L thigh
 compartment in ___ s/p surgery and chemoradiation, and newly-diagnosed left
 thoracic tumor with complication of collapased left lung, is transferred from

 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided chest tube is present. There is a small peripheral pneumothorax
 seen at the left apex hand along the upper left lung. There is subcutaneous
 emphysema.
 
 A large rounded density lies near the tip of the chest tube, abutting the
 mediastinum with expected level of the aortic arch. There are focal the
 somewhat mass-like densities in the left mid lung laterally the abutting the
 left chest wall. There is some increased density with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, as well, consistent with some degree of lower lobe
 collapse/consolidation. Equivocal minimal leftward mediastinal shift.
 
 The right lung volume is slightly low, but there is no evidence of CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion on the right side. No right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest tube overlying left upper lung. Small pneumothorax. Appearance is
 similar to the film from earlier the same morning.
