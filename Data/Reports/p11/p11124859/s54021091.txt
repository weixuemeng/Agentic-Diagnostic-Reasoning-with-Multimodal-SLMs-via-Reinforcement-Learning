                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L pneumonectomy  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there is no significant
 change in air fluid levels in the left hemithorax, suggesting previous
 apparent increase in air fluid levels on radiographs on ___ was
 secondary to patient positioning versus a bronchopleural fistula.  There is
 continued near opacification of the entire left hemithorax  status post left
 pneumonectomy.  There is slight decrease in subcutaneous air in the left chest
 wall.  The right lung is clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are difficult to
 assess given pneumonectomy.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change in gas component in the left hemithorax, indicating the
 apparent increase in air-fluid levels in the left hemithorax on radiographs on
 ___ was secondary to patient positioning rather than a
 bronchopleural fistula.
