                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent removal of an obstructing left bronchus tumor. Assess for
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including the most recent from ___. CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest tube is unchanged. Since the prior exam, the amount of pleural
 fluid has significantly decreased.  A small left apical pneumothorax is
 unchanged.  Moderate subcutaneous emphysema is again noted and unchanged. 
 Aeration at the left base has also improved with the reduction in size of the
 pleural effusion. The rounded opacity in the left upper lung is stable in size
 with persistent collapse of the left upper lobe around the mass.  The right
 lung is essentially clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease in size of the left pleural effusion and improved aeration at the
 left base. A small apical left pneumothorax and the upper lobe mass are not
 significantly changed since the prior exam.
