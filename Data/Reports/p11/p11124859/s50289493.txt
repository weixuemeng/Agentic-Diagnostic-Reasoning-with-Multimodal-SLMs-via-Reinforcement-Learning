                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with myxoid liposarcoma metastatic to left lung s/p
 neoadjuvant chemo/XRT now s/p left pneumonectomy, takeback for left hemothorax
 // please evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs on ___, CT chest on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there is continued almost
 complete opacification of the left hemithorax status post left pneumonectomy,
 with an apparent increase in air fluid levels in the left hemithorax, although
 the amount of air appears similar to CT chest on ___, suggesting
 this apparent increase is due to patient positioning differences versus a
 bronchial stump leak.  There is residual subcutaneous air in the left neck and
 chest wall.  The right lung is clear without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.   The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 difficult to assess given pneumonectomy.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates
 in the proximal right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in air-fluid levels in the left hemithorax may be related to
 differences in patient positioning.  Short-term followup fully upright chest
 radiograph is suggested to exclude true increase in gas component which would
 be concerning for postoperative bronchopleural fistula.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend short-term follow-up radiograph to exclude
 bronchial stump leak.
