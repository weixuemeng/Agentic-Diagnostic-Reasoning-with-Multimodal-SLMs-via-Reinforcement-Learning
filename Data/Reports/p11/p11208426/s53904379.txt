                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Extensive emphysematous changes are again seen, most pronounced
 within the upper lobes bilaterally.  Deformity of the left upper and lateral
 hemithorax with increased sclerosis of the left anterolateral ribs is a result
 of patient's known large chest wall mass, better demonstrated on the prior
 chest CT.  Trace left pleural effusion is again seen.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation, right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Deformity of the left upper lateral hemithorax with increased sclerosis of the
 ribs is compatible with known large chest wall mass, better delineated on the
 previous chest CT.  Small left pleural effusion. No new areas of focal
 consolidation identified.
