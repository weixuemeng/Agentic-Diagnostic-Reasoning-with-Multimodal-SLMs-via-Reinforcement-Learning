                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenia and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are hyperexpanded
 with bilateral interstitial abnormality compatible with known severe
 emphysema, which contributes to right upper lung confluent peripheral
 reticular changes.  Left mid lung opacities are chronic and likely result from
 a combination of the known destructive chest wall mass, post-treatment changes
 and severe emphysema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged on the
 right and slightly increased on the left.  The heart and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged small right and increased small left pleural effusions
 with chronic changes related to known chest wall mass and severe emphysema.
