                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An opacity in the left mid lung zone with associated rib
 abnormalities and a soft tissue mass is not significantly changed from the
 prior chest radiograph.  This is consistent with the known large chest wall
 mass, previously characterized on the recent CT.  In comparison to prior exam,
 the lung volumes are lower.  There is a new right patchy basilar
 consolidation.  Emphysematous changes are stable.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New patchy opacification at the right base; possibly due to a new
 pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up radiographs after treatment to ensure
 resolution.
 2.  Stable appearance of the left mid lung zone opacity and chest wall
 deformity, consistent with the known large chest wall mass.
