                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ascending aorta repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are somewhat better lung
 volumes in this patient with extensive midline wires following cardiac
 surgery.  Central catheter again extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the
 SVC.  Opacification at the left base is again consistent with some combination
 of volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  There is evidence of
 pulmonary edema persisting.
