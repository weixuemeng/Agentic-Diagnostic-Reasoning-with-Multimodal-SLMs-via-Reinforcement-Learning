                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:52 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD and aortic dissection, with acute rigors
 and shortness of breath.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 I see no focal consolidation, though the lower lungs are partially obscured by
 the heart, descending aorta and hemidiaphragms respectively.  The upper lungs
 are entirely clear.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Thoracic
 aorta is generally large, and comparable in caliber and course to the
 appearance on some, but not all prior chest radiographs.  It would be
 extremely difficult to detect change in or recurrence of aortic dissection on
 conventional radiographs alone.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
 effusion.
