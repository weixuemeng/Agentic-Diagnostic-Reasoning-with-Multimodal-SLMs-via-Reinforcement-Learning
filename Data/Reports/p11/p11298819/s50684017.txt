                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post type A dissection repair with
 ascending aortic graft.  Evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded, without focal opacities. There is
 nearly total opacification of the left lower lung field likely from a
 combination of a left-sided pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.  There is a
 small right-sided effusion which appears unchanged compared with prior exam. 
 The left-sided effusion is difficult to assess but also appears stable.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  There has been interval
 removal of a right-sided IJ line.  Surgical clips adjacent to the right
 coracoid process are unchanged in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal parenchymal opacity.  Stable bilateral pleural
 effusions.
