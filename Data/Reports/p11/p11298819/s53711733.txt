                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, increased respiratory rate, question acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with background COPD.  There are
 sternotomy wires.  There is cardiomegaly, with a calcified, ectatic unfolded
 aorta.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  No CHF, focal infiltrate
 or gross effusion is identified.  Clips noted overlying the right upper
 scapula.  
 
 Targeted review of the report from a CTA dated ___ indicated a thoracic
 aortic repair and a 4 mm right lower lobe nodule.  A small nodular density is
 seen at the left lung apex on today's study was not identified on prior study
 and could represent artifact due to overlap of vascular and osseous shadows.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known thoracic aorta repair.  No acute pulmonary process
 identified.
