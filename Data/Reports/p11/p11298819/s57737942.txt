                                 FINAL REPORT

 HISTORY:  Possible right lower lobe pneumonia and aortic dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to AP chest on ___
 shows that the generally enlarged and tortuous thoracic aorta is generally
 larger than it was in ___.  This appearance is more characteristic
 of an aneurysmal dissection and a simple thoracic aortic aneurysm.  Heart size
 is normal and there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There are no
 findings to suggest pneumonia.  Small pleural effusion collecting posteriorly
 is probably on the right side, seen only on the lateral view.
 
 Findings and their clinical significance were discussed with Dr. ___ at
 the time of dictation.
