                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart failure  // evaluate for interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a Swan-Ganz catheter is been
 placed, with tip of the catheter projecting approximately 3.7 cm distal to the
 central right hilum, likely within a segmental branch.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for improving pulmonary edema, with residual heterogeneous lower
 lung opacities worse on the left than the right.  Although potentially due to
 asymmetrical edema, coexisting infection in the left lower lobe should also be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Right pleural effusion is
 nearly resolved, and a small to moderate left pleural effusion persists with
 possible loculation laterally.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 9:27 AM, 5 minutes after discovery
 of the findings.
