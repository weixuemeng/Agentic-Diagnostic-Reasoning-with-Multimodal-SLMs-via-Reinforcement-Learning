 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple PTX  // Please assess for
 recurrence of PTX      Please assess for recurrence of PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in
 the appearance of the right chest tube and small apical pneumothorax. 
 Continued opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. 
 Although this could merely represent pleural fluid and atelectasis, though in
 the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
 Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size.  Indistinctness
 of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
