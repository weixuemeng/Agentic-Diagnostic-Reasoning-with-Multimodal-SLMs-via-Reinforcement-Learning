                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Motor vehicle collision and spinal tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mild to
 moderately enlarged.  There is apparent widening of the superior mediastinum
 which could be due to low lung volumes. The mediastinal contours are otherwise
 smooth.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal and the lungs are clear.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum
 may be due to low lung volumes or mediastinal lipomatosis, however if there is
 concern for trauma to the chest, a CTA of chest should be performed for
 further evaluation.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
