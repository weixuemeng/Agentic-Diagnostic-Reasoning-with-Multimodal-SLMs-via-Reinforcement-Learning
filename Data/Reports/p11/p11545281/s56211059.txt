                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with severe episode of
 lightheadedness, question cardiomegaly or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 lungs remain hyperinflated.  Costochondral calcifications are again evident. 
 There is evidence of multiple old rib fractures, particularly on the left. 
 Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis,
 although early consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta remains
 calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to
 atelectasis, although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest
 could be helpful for further evaluation.
