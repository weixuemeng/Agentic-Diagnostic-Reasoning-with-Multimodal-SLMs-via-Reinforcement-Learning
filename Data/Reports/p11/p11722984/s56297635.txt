 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume but
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in
 size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis
 is noted. Lumbar spine hardware incompletely assessed.  Due to technique, the
 thoracic vertebral body heights are poorly assessed.
