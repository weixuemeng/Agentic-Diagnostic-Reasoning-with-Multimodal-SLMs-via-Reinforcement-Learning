                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small subtle patchy opacity projecting over the left base, best seen on the
 frontal view, may be due to overlapping structures or possibly small focus of
 aspiration, given history.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 right lung is clear.  The cardiac mediastinal silhouette are unremarkable. 
 Partially imaged is surgical hardware in the lumbar spine, not well evaluated.
