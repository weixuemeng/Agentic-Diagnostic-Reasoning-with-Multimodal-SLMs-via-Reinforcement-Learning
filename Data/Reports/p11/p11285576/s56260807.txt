 Right internal jugular introducer catheter is unchanged.  Stably enlarged
 postoperative appearance of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There
 continues to be hazy opacity throughout both lungs which may be slightly worse

 opacity in the retrocardiac region is suggestive of partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There are likely stable bilateral layering effusions.
