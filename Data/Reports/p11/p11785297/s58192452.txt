                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax in a patient status post right PTBD
 internalization, right thoracentesis, and repositioning of a pigtail within a
 liver abscess.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a nasoenteric to extending below the
 diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, as well as a right approach
 pigtail catheter overlying the right upper quadrant, presumably within the
 hepatic abscess.  A moderate right pleural effusion, which extends over the
 right lung apex, is decreased compared to the prior chest radiograph. No
 obvious focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion, decreased compared to prior chest radiograph.
 No pneumothorax visualized.
