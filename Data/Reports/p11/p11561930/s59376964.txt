                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with asthma, presenting with acute
 exacerbation and hypoxia, evaluate for consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 21:48.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 9:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given patient rotation on the
 current examination.  There is patchy opacity at the right base, which may
 reflect an area of atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is a prominence of the interstitium, which likely is related
 to the history of small airways disease.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax
 are visualized.
