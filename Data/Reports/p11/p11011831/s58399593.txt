                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis is seen.  A subtle nodular opacity is seen at the
 right lung base.  The lungs are otherwise clear of focal consolidation,
 pleural fusion pneumothorax.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The heart
 size is normal, and the mediastinal contours are normal.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.

 Subtle nodular opacity seen at the right lung base can be further evaluated
 with a non-emergent chest CT.
