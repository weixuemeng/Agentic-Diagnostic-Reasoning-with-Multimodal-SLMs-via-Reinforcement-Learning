                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p complex tracheal / neck resection  // eval ?
 interval change      eval ? interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs, ___ through ___.
 
 I think that the interfaces in the right hemi thorax parallel to the chest
 wall are due to overlying skin folds.  I recommend an upright view, taking
 special care to reduce any skin folds in order to exclude a subtle
 pneumothorax.  2 right pleural drains are still in place.
 
 Left lower lobe remains collapsed and small to moderate left pleural effusion
 unchanged.
 
 Normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette.
