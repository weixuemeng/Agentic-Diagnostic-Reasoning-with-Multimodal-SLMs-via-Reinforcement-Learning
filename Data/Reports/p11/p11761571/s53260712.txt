 As compared to the previous image, there is a marked increase in transparency
 of the lung parenchyma, likely reflecting improved ventilation, and associated
 with a decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing bilateral perihilar
 opacities.  Mild cardiomegaly persists. Areas of atelectasis at the right and
 the left lung base are unchanged.  Unchanged position of the monitoring and
 support devices.
