 COMPARISON:  Comparisons to ___ at 06:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 10:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line, tracheostomy tube, vascular stents are unchanged.
 There are layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace
 disease, left greater the right tube which is also unchanged. Overlying the
 right mid clavicle is a more prominent soft tissue asymmetry which may
 represent an enlarging hematoma or be related to the recent reconstructive
 surgery given differences in positioning. Clinical correlation is advised. The
 perihilar vasculature is slightly more prominent which raises the possibility
 of superimposed mild interstitial edema. Again, clinical correlation would be
 recommended. No pneumothorax.
