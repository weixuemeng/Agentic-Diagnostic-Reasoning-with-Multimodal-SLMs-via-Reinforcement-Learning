 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tracheal resection
 
 TECHNIQUE:   PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   Radiographs dating back to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been extubated.  New left retrocardiac opacity likely
 atelectasis is associated with inferior displacement of the left hilum. There
 is also a new right retrocardiac opacity.  Small bilateral effusions are also
 new.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to substantial left lower lobe
 atelectasis but coexisting pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
