 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line, right carotid vascular stent and tracheostomy tube
 unchanged in position.  The tracheostomy tube continues to have its tip
 approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.  Surgical clips are again seen
 overlying the right axilla and right hilar region in this patient status post
 reconstructive surgery.  There are layering bilateral effusions with stable
 retrocardiac consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base likely
 reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
