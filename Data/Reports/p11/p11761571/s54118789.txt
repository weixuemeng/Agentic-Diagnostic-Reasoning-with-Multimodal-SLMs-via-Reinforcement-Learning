 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:13 PM
  A tracheostomy tube ends 1.5 cm above the carina. A right PICC ends at the
  cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax. Bilateral parenchymal opacities and mild
  pulmonary edema are slightly improved compared to the prior radiograph
  performed 7 hr prior. ___ ___ ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach. Concern for proximal migration of
 trach.  // Please confirm location of trach.      Please confirm location of
 trach.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison a prior study dated ___ at 10:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube now has its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carinal.
 A right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. A right neck
 vascular stent remains in position. Bilateral airspace opacities are again
 seen although it appears slightly more confluent in the right upper lobe on
 the current study. There is a layering left effusion and likely a small right
 effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient positioning.  No pneumothorax is seen although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No
 pulmonary edema.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the lower right axilla
 and in the right hilar vicinity in this patient status post recent
 reconstructive surgery.
