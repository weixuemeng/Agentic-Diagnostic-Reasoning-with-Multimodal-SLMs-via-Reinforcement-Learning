                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with carotid hemorrhage sp stents  // ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through P ___ at 05:10.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse developed between ___ and ___
 accompanied by small left pleural effusion. On ___ there was new
 consolidation in the left lower lung laterally, either in the upper lobe or
 aerated lower lobe, probably pneumonia or aspiration leading to pneumonia,
 also responsible for the large scale consolidation that developed in the right
 lower lobe concurrent with increased intravascular volume today later, on
 ___. Pulmonary edema developed on ___, perhaps with
 worsening pneumonia. Read in conjunction with the chest radiograph taken
 earlier today, the combination of bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and
 moderately severe pulmonary edema is the most likely explanation for
 developments over the past several days. Edema has worsened since earlier in
 the day and there is probably a moderate volume of pleural fluid on the left,
 small amount on the right. Heart is normal size, but mediastinal veins are
 still distended. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Avascular per stent has been inserted in the right neck.
