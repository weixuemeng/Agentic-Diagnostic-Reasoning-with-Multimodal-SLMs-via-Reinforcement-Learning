  1. The right neck stent is no longer seen.  Anterior fusion hardware in the
  mid thoracic spine is new since prior exam.  Also new or multiple median
  sternotomy wires and bilateral chest tubes.  Slight widening of the
  mediastinum in comparison to prior radiograph is consistent with stated
  mediastinal surgery.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects relaxation
  atelectasis in the setting of a persistent small left pleural effusion.  No
  pulmonary edema or focal consolidation elsewhere.  No pneumothorax or right
  pleural effusion.
  2. Again seen is left-sided PICC line, however the distal tip is not clearly
  seen.
  
   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___,
  M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:___ PM, ___ minutes after discovery of
  the findings.  Dr. ___ ___ that the left PICC line had been removed
  since this radiograph was taken.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p tracheal reconstruction and innominate
 art resection  // trach placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, a right chest tube has been
 placed.  Small to moderate right pneumothorax is present with predominantly
 basilar component and lesser apical component.  Left PICC has apparently been
 withdrawn, now terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for worsening left lower lobe collapse and persistent
 small left pleural effusion.
