                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheal resection, now with tracheostomy, carotid stent
 and peck flap to neck stenting to innominate and subclavian, postop
 surveillance.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is present.  A separate tube overlying the soft tissues of
 the right neck presumably represents the carotid stent.  A right-sided PICC
 line is present, with tip over distal SVC. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with probable vascular plethora, and, I
 suspect, mild CHF/alveolar edema.  There are small bilateral effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 Compared to the prior film, the degree of the alveolar consolidation,
 particularly in the right upper zone, is slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) CHF with alveolar edema, slightly improved, but still significant. 2) Left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small bilateral effusions,
 similar to prior.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult
 to exclude an underlying infectious infiltrate.  
 3) No obvious pneumothorax.
