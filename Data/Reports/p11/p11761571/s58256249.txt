 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The
 monitoring and support devices are constant.  The lungs are better ventilated
 than on the previous image, resulting in larger lung volumes. Nevertheless,
 areas of atelectasis persists at both the left and the right lung bases.
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  No larger pleural effusions.
