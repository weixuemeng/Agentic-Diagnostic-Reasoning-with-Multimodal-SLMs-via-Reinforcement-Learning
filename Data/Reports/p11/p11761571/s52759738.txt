                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for effusion or atelectasis in a patient status post
 right neck fistula repair, tracheal reconstruction, and muscle flap presenting
 with new shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates intact
 sternal wires, mediastinal clips, and a right PICC which terminates in the low
 SVC.  Heart size is normal.  There is mild pulmonary edema, new compared to
 prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar to slightly
 increased in size.  A rounded area opacification along the right lateral hemi
 thorax may also represent loculated effusion, present dating back to ___.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely due to atelectasis, is unchanged. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is greater on the left than right.  There is no definite
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, similar to
 slightly increased size.  A rounded area of opacification along the right
 lateral hemithorax may represent loculated effusion.  A lateral view would be
 helpful if permitted by patient condition.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
