                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shaking chills and low grade temp  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests central vascular
 engorgement.  Left base opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis and
 overlap of structures, however consolidation due to pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. 
 Degenerative changes seen at the acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity could be due to overlapping structures, however,
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
