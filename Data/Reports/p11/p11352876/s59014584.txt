 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis
 and crowding of bronchovascular structures.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects a combination of
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures and atelectasis.
