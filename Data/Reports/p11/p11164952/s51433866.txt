                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and chest pain.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are lower than prior, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Lower lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
