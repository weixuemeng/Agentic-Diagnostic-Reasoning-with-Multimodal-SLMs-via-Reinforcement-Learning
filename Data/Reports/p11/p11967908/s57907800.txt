                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is mildly engorged, appearing somewhat asymmetrically
 more so on the right.  Right apical pleural thickening and scarring with
 associated calcification is re- demonstrated, likely reflective of prior post
 treatment changes from prior radiation therapy.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left persists.  There are associated atelectatic
 changes in both lower lobes.  Patchy ill-defined opacity within the right mid
 lung field with associated peribronchial cuffing is new compared to the prior
 CT, and could reflect an area of infection.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Multiple clips are noted in the right axillary region compatible with prior
 lymph node dissection.  Mild deformity of the right breast shadow is
 compatible with prior lumpectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Patchy vague opacity in the right mid lung field with associated
 peribronchial thickening could reflect an area of infection.  
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis, not significantly changed.
 
 4. Unchanged right apical pleural thickening and scarring compatible with
 prior radiation changes.
