                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with new fever, crackles right side  // Eval for infiltrate,

 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Clips in the right axilla again
 noted.  A left subclavian and axillary stent is in place.  Calcified pleural
 plaque accounts for calcified density projecting over the right mid lung. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is mild hilar congestion and
 mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Lower lung subtle opacities raise
 potential concern for a superimposed pneumonia.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
