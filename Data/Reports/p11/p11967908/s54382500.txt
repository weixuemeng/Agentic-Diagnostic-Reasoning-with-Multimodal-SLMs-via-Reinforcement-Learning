                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sudden worsening shortness of breath  //
 Pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, as well as ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right apical pleural thickening is re- demonstrated.  Hilar prominence is
 again seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Slight
 increased interstitial markings bilaterally is concerning for mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is also slight increase in left base
 opacity which may be due a combination of interstitial edema and trace pleural
 effusions although consolidation is not excluded.  There slight blunting of
 the bilateral posterior costophrenic angle suggesting trace pleural effusions.
 Pulmonary nodules were better assessed on chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval slight increase in interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally
 suggests mild interstitial edema.
 
 Trace pleural effusions.
 
 Increased opacity at the lung bases, particularly on the left, may be due to
 combination of interstitial edema and small pleural effusions however
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.
