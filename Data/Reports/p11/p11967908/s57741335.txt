                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with breast cancer, lymphoma, now
 oliguric.  Study requested for evaluation of volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 improved pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Smooth
 thickening of the right apical pleural margin and retraction of the right
 hilum is consistent with radiation changes. Speckled calcifications in the
 right upper lung are stable from prior chest radiograph. There is an
 indeterminate volume, likely small right pleural effusion.  There are no focal
 consolidations or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. Patient is status post right axial dissection with
 clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion, no pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Unchanged apical pleural thickening and calcification compatible with
 radiation changes from prior treatment of breast cancer.
