                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sudden onset dyspnea  // evaluate for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within normal limits.
 The heart is normal in size. The lungs are hyper expanded consistent with
 emphysema, similar to the prior exam.  Calcifications project over the right
 upper lobe as before.  Again seen is asymmetric right apical pleural
 thickening, with crowding of vessels in scarring in the right upper zone
 retraction of the right hilum.  Clips are seen over the right axilla,
 unchanged in appearance from the prior study. Bilateral perihilar and
 bibasilar opacities raise the question of mild CHF, minimally increased from
 the prior examination. No focal consolidation is identified. No pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is mild blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD, with extensive background parenchymal scarring, right apical pleural
 thickening, right apical scarring and calcification, and right hilar
 retraction, again seen. Please note that small pulmonary nodules can be
 radiographically occult.
 
 Perihilar and bibasilar reticular opacities, minimally more pronounced than on
 the prior study from ___ raise the question of mild superimposed CHF.
 Atypical infection could also be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
