 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.  Recent diagnosis of lymphoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips are again present in the right axilla.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Upward tenting of the medial
 right hemidiaphragm is very similar.  There is a persistent small-to-moderate
 pleural effusion on the right witand a small one on the left.  Fissures are
 mildly thickened.  Subpleural thickening at the right lung apex appears
 stable.  There is a new mild interstitial abnormality including Kerley B lines
 and peribronchial cuffing suggesting mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  However, there is no definite new focal opacity.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.
