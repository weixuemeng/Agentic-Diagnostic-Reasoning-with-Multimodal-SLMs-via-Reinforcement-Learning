 thickening, right greater than left and a rounded calcified opacities in the
 right upper lobe.  Left base scarring is again seen, less prominent compared
 to the most recent chest radiograph. Slightly increased opacity in the lateral
 right lung base could represent an early pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
