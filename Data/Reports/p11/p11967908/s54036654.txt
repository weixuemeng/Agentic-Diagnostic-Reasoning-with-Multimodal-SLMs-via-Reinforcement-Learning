                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with history of right breast cancer and radiation with new
 oxygen requirements.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 In normal cardiac silhouette.  Right apical pleural thickening similar to
 priors and likely due to radiation therapy.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips in the right axillary region
 compatible with prior lymph node dissection.  Mild pulmonary venous
 congestion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No radiographic explanation for increased oxygen requirements. CT of the chest
 may be considered to determine pulmonary embolism as cause of increased oxygen
 requirements if clinically warranted.
