 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fevers/chills

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Calcifications projecting
 over the right mid and upper lung fields are similar compared to the previous
 exam, reflecting a combination of pleural calcifications and chest wall
 calcifications. Scarring with bronchiectasis is again noted in the right apex.
 No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
 Multiple clips are again seen in the right axillary region as well as
 overlying the right hemidiaphragm. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 Remote right proximal humeral fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar scarring and bronchiectasis within the right apex and calcifications
 projecting over the right upper and mid lung fields. No focal consolidation.
