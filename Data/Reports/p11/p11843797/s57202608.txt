                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman no known medical hx, who was found on the floor
 by her daughter, awake and alert but somewhat confused found to have rising
 troponins.with acute desaturation  // ?reason for hypoxia    ?reason for
 hypoxia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is more
 prominent and there is again evidence mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease, though no definite acute focal pneumonia is appreciated.  Prominence
 of the central pulmonary vessels suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 There is soft tissue prominence of the right peritracheal region.  This could
 merely represent tortuous brachiocephalic vessels, with the apparent increase
 related to a more oblique position of the patient.
