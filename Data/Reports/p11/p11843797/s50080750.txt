                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is relatively kyphotic in position.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Prominence of the hila suggests central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  There is subtle increase in interstitial markings bilaterally
 which can be seen with mild interstitial edema although may relate to
 underlying COPD.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible mild interstitial edema.
 
 COPD.
