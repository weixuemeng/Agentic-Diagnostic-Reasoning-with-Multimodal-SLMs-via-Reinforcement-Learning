                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is mild flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with
 some chronic pulmonary disease.  There is some opacification at the left base
 laterally that most likely represents atelectatic change.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, developing consolidation would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
