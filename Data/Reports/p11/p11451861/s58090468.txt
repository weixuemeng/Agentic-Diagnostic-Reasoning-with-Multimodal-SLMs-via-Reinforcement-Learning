                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent RLL pneumonia including RUL lesion.
 Treated with abx and feeling better  // assess for resolution of any and all
 opacities, particularly the RUL opacity.     assess for resolution of any and
 all opacities, particularly the RUL opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  The previously seen right lower lobe pneumonia has
 completely resolved.  However, the right upper lobe nodule, adjacent to the
 fissure is seen in unchanged manner.  The nodule seems to have a retractile
 component.  As noted in the previous report, this nodule must be followed by a
 CT, to exclude the possibility of a neoplastic lesion.  No pleural effusions. 
 No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the heart.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT is required further workup of the right upper lobe
 nodule, to exclude potential malignancy.
