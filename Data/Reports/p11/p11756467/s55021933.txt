                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and progressive weakness; history of congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is similar
 mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Bilateral perihilar fullness is noted
 with increased distention of central pulmonary arteries and indistinct
 vascular and interstitial markings, consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggest coinciding minor atelectasis. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are similar
 moderate degenerative changes along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
