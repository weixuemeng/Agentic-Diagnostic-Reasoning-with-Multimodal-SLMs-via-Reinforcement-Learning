                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob.  Assess for shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with focal linear left lower lobe opacity. 
 Mild vascular congestion is present.  No focal opacity.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly with coronary stents is stable.  A
 tortuous aorta is present.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are notable for multilevel degenerative changes
 of the thoracic spine with endplate sclerosis and disc space loss.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion.
 2.  Left basilar opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.  If there is
 strong clinical suspicion for pneumonia, short-term followup radiographs may
 be considered.
