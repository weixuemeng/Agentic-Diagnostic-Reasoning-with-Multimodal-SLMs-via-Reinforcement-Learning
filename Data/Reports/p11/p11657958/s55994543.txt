 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Hiatal hernia is suspected on the
 lateral view.  The increased lucency of the left lung corresponds to left
 mastectomy.  Lungs are essentially clear with no consolidations to suggest
 infectious process.  No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
