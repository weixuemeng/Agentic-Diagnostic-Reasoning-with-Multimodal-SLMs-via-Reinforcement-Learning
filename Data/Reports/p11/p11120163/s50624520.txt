                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Left PICC terminates in the low
 SVC.  Small left pleural effusion and substantial left lower lobe
 consolidation, perhaps atelectasis, have increased from the previous
 examination; much smaller right pleural effusion is probably larger than
 before as well.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is probably normal,
 though exaggerated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal appearance is normal. Left
 hilus is indistinct.
 
 There is greater opacification and separation of bowel loops in the left upper
 abdomen.  Suggest CT to evaluate possible recurrent subdiaphragmatic
 infection, contributing to increased left pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: Interval increase in small left pleural effusion and accompanying
 left basilar opacity that is most likely atelectasis, but conceivably
 pneumonia.
