                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 prominence of the mediastinum, which could relate to body habitus and
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  However, in the absence of priors for a comparison,
 underlying lymphadenopathy or other mediastinal process is not excluded.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate
 the bronchovascular markings.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the mediastinum may be due to patient body habitus
 and underlying mediastinal lipomatosis, however, in the absence of priors for
 comparison, lymphadenopathy or other mediastinal process not excluded.  No
 definite focal consolidation.
