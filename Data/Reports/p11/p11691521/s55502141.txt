                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with elevated WBC(count); infection?
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bedside AP and lateral views labeled "upright" are compared with
 the frontal view of ___.  Allowing for differences in exposure factors
 and degree of patient rotation, there is now dense retrocardiac opacity with
 "silhouetting" of the medial left hemidiaphragm and descending aorta.  This
 process is especially new, associated with air bronchograms and likely
 represents pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe.  There is more
 pronounced subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base, with no other
 focal airspace process.  There is stable left ventricular enlargement as well
 as marked tortuosity and unfolding of the thoracic aorta, but no pulmonary
 vascular congestion, large pleural effusion, or other evidence of CHF.
 
 Again demonstrated are moderate thoracolumbar dextroscoliosis with profound
 diffuse osteopenia, mid-thoracic "vertebra plana" appearance, status post
 likely T7 vertebroplasty.  Also noted are numerous surgical clips in the left
 axilla and the lower right lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense retrocardiac consolidation, largely new since the study of
 ___, likely pneumonic, with associated small pleural effusion.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___, Orthopedics
 service), via telephone at ___, ___, the time of their discovery.
