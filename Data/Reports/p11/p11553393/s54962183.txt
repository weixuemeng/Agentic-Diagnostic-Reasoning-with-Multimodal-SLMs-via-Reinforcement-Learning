                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with alcohol withdrawal, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison to prior chest film of ___ at 21:59.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the stomach, unchanged.  Lungs appear
 clear.  More focal nodular opacity projecting over the right fifth
 posterolateral rib does not have a correlate on the recent chest CT of
 ___ and therefore is felt to be related to superimposed shadows.  No
 focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
