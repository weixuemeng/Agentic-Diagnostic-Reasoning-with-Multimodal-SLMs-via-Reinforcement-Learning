                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath, malaise since 5 days ago, EKG
 changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mild to moderately enlarged, unchanged.  The
 aorta is markedly tortuous, as seen previously.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Minimal streaky
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, without focal consolidation.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus may reflect a trace pleural effusion.  No right pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky retrocardiac atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
