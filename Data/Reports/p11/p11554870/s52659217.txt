                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NGT for suspected small esophageal
 perforation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day prior chest x-ray from 10:57.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left-sided PICC line with distal tip projecting over the mid
 SVC, in grossly appropriate location.  New since prior is an enteric tube
 which courses inferiorly.  The distal tip is not clearly seen due to overlying
 soft tissue/underpenetration, however the tip is at least beyond the GE
 junction probably overlying the stomach.  The distal side port is not well
 seen.  Otherwise, allowing for technical differences, doubt significant
 interval change in appearance of the lungs or mediastinal structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left PICC line with distal tip projecting over the mid SVC.
 2. Enteric tube coursing below the diaphragm; although distal tip is not
 clearly seen, this at least overlies the stomach.  The distal side port is not
 clearly identified.
 3. Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
