  Right IJ in low SVC - unchanged. ET tube 4.7 cm from carina.  NG in the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:08 P.M ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening atelectasis.  Suspect mucus plugging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 6:05
 a.m.:
 
 Over the course of the day a mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
 congestion have improved, mediastinal venous engorgement has not, but this
 could be a function of supine positioning.  I see no appreciable pneumothorax.
 Pleural effusion if any is minimal.  ET tube and right internal jugular line
 are in standard placements respectively and a nasogastric tube passes below
 the diaphragm and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
