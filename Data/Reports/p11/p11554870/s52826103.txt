                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with h/o afib on Coumadin, PE p/w sudden onset cp, sob and
 lightheadedness.  Assess for acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated with persistent bilateral reticular opacities
 predominantly within the lung bases.  Stable 1.3 cm nodular opacity seen on
 the lateral projection, unchanged from ___ is compatible with a
 bone island in a thoracic vertebral body.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly with
 unfolded aorta and mild vascular congestion.  Mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable.  No significant pleural effusion nor pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine with anterior
 osteophytes disc space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly without acute cardiopulmonary process.
