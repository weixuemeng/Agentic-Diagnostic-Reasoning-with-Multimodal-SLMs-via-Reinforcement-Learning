                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, cough and wheezing as well as
 shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are clear of
 consolidation.  The flattened hemidiaphragms and a large AP dimension of the
 thoracic cavity suggest emphysema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  An ill-defined lucency over a mid thoracic vertebral body was
 not present on prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence for pneumonia.
 2.  Lucency in a mid-thoracic vertebral body; correlate with history to assess
 for whether or not this could be affiliated with metastatic disease.
