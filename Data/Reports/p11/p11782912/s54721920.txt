 In discussion with the referring physician by telephone, Dr. ___,
 ___ can be accounted for as an external towel clamp and does not have the
 same appearance as the missing clamp, an image of which is also provided.  The
 patient is intubated.  A transesophageal echo device projects over the central
 mediastinum.  There are bilateral chest tubes and two centrally placed
 mediastinal drains.  A band-like opacity in the right mid lung suggests
 atelectasis.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis is also noted.  Mediastinal
 widening is anticipated following cardiac surgery.  There is no evidence for
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
