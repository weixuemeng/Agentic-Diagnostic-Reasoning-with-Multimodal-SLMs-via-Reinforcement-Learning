                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST:  There has been interval removal of the right
 internal jugular catheter.  The lungs are well expanded and clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Diaphragms are
 flattened with increased retrosternal clear space compatible with provided
 history of COPD.  Linear scarring in the left mid lung is unchanged.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact with changes after CABG and the mediastinum is
 narrower, as expected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
