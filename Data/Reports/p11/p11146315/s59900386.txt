                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with NHL s/pC5DAEPOCH presenting with fever, back pain. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Right-sided chest port is seen terminating around the cavoatrial junction. 
 Again seen is a linear opacity around the right fifth and sixth rib, likely
 corresponding with the previously described consolidation and better evaluated
 on subsequent CT from the same day, though less conspicuous compared to the
 prior chest radiograph.  There is bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Linear opacity in the right lung, improved since prior chest radiograph
 from ___.  Findings are better assessed on CT performed the same
 date.
 2. Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be due
 to trace pleural effusions or atelectasis.
