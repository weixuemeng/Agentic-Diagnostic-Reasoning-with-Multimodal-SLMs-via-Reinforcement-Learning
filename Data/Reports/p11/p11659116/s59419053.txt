                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___   
 
 HISTORY:  VATS decortication.  Chest tube removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Only one left basal pleural tube remains.  There is no left pneumothorax. 
 Extensive left pleural abnormality, predominantly basal, with substantial
 lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  Right lung is clear.  Heart size has not
 enlarged, but is difficult to assess given the adjacent atelectasis from
 pleural abnormality.  There is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, but the
 mediastinal contour particularly in the region of the aortic knob is distorted
 by loculated pleural fluid.  Right lung grossly clear.  No right pleural
 abnormality.
