                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Loculated left pleural effusion has decreased in size with only a
 small residual effusion remaining.  Adjacent atelectasis in the left lower
 lobe and lingula has also improved.  Small nodular opacity persists at the
 level of the third left anterior rib, has previously been shown to be stable
 since ___, favoring either a granuloma or hamartoma.  A sub-cm nodule is also
 demonstrated at the junction of the right third anterior and right seventh
 posterior ribs, consistent with a benign granuloma on prior chest CT.  No
 pleural effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Decrease in loculated left pleural effusion as well as improved aeration at
 left lung base.
 
 Benign bilateral upper lobe lung nodules.
