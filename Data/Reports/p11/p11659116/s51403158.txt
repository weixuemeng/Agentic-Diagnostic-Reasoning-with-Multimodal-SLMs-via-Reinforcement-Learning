                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left loculated effusion status post pigtail
 placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 EXAMINATION:  SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall, there is little change in a loculated large left pleural effusion
 since ___ with associated rightward mediastinal shift.  A left basilar
 pigtail catheter has been placed projecting over the left base.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no large right effusion or pneumothorax,
 with a trace effusion not excluded.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There
 is dense left basilar consolidation, likely atelectasis, and effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of a loculated effusion after left basilar
 pigtail placement on the left.  No evidence of pneumothorax. In comparison to
 prior Chest CT, the largest area of fluid is demonstrated superolaterally in
 relation to the pigtail catheter, with the catheter probably external to this
 region.
