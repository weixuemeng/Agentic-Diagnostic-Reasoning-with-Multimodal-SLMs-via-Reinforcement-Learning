                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known pleural effusion, assess interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating
 interval increase in opacity obscuring the left mid and lower lung which is
 smoothly marginated with a convex contour along its superior extent likely due
 to a bulging fissure. Given this shape, the opacity likely reflects
 consolidation with possible loculated pleural fluid. The right lung remains
 clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size cannot be assessed due to
 adjacent opacity.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in left mid and lower lung consolidation with
 possible loculared edffusion.  Recommend followup to resolution.
