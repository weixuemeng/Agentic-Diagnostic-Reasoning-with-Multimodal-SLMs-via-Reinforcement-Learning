                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for the AP technique, cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Redemonstrated are bilateral interstitial opacities with lower lobe
 predominance that are grossly unchanged compared to the prior radiograph,
 thought to represent NSIP on the most recent CT.  There is no consolidation or
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent bilateral interstitial opacities, grossly unchanged compared to
 prior examination, and thought to reflect NSIP on previous CT.
 
 2.  No consolidation or pleural effusion.
