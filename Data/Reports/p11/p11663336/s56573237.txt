  Low lung volumes.  The right lung base consolidation with loss of the
  hemidiaphragm contour could represent infection or atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and
 pulmonary vasculature.  Heart size is top normal with mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is consolidation of
 the right lung base with loss of the hemidiaphragmatic contour reflecting
 probably pleural effusion with either associated atelectasis or possible
 pneumonia.  The upper lung fields are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base consolidation with loss of the hemidiaphragmatic
 contour which likely represents pleural effusion with either associated
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Investigation of the right upper quadrant with
 ultrasound could be a useful confirmatory tool to confirm effusion as well as
 for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic pathology.
