                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 9:41
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 17:15.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 9:45 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm
 and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach.  Lung volumes
 are reduced and there are now patchy bibasilar opacities most likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Calcification
 of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given lordotic technique
 and patient positioning.
