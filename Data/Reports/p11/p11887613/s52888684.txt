                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are intact midline sutures
 in place.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. 
 Right IJ sheath is in place.  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. 
 There is some widening of the mediastinum, presumably postoperative.  Minimal
 atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
