                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Heart failure. Question pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac contours are partly obscured by pleural effusions but the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar aside from new moderate
 perihilar vascular congestive changes. In addition to mild new pulmonary
 edema, a left-sided pleural effusion appears moderate in size and similar to
 perhaps mildly increased. Small pleural effusion on the right has increased
 somewhat.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Some increase in pleural effusions. Mild vascular congestion.
