 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with cardiac size top normal. 
 There has been interval resolution of left pneumothorax.  Small left effusion
 has decreased.  Bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side, have also
 decreased.  If any, there is a small right effusion.  Hypodensity material
 projecting over the liver are again noted.  Opacities close to the surgical
 chain in the left upper lobe have markedly improved.
