                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS and chest tube removal, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 pneumothorax on the left has decreased in extent.  Also decreased is the
 dimension of the known air-fluid level close to the chest wall.  However, both
 changes are still clearly visible.  There is no evidence of tension.  The
 lateral radiograph shows signs of basal atelectasis and pleural effusions. 
 The radiodense material projecting over the liver as well as the clips in the
 left perihilar region are constant in appearance.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
