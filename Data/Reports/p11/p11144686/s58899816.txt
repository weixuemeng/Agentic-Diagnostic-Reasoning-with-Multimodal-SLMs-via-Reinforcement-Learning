                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following of VATS lingulectomy, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Chest tube is in place on the left with no pneumothorax.  Vague opacification
 in the perihilar region most likely reflects sequela of the recent surgery.
 
 Right lung is clear.
