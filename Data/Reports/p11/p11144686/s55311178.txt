                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic ocular
 melanoma and history of hepatectomy complicated by biliary leak and
 perihepatic abscess, now with bronchobiliary fistula.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior
 studies obtained a day before.
 
 The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  As compared to prior
 study, there is slight interval progression of right lower lobe opacity,
 although it might be reflecting the semi-upright character of this study. 
 Right chest tube is more proximal than on the prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
