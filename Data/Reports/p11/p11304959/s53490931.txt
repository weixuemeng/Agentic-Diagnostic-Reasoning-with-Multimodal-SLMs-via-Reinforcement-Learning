                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB, CHF vs pneumonia sepsis  // Interval
 change      Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little interval
 change in the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure and left pleural effusion with compressive basilar
 atelectasis.
 
 The lateral view shows that there is increased opacification just behind 1 of
 the major fissures and possibly also just anterior to the fluid collections.
 In view of the clinical history, this is worrisome for developing pneumonia
