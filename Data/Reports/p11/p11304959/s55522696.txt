 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increasing shortness of breath and leg
 swelling, question congestive failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular
 markings are seen bilaterally.  There are moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well assessed due to the
 bibasilar opacities but is at least slightly enlarged.  Surgical clips project
 over the mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral effusions and moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Please note that superimposed infection at the bases would be difficult to
 exclude.
