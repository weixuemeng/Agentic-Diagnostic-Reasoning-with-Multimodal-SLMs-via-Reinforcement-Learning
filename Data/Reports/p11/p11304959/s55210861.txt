                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SSS s/p PPM  // r/o pneumo and lead
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Serial chest radiographs most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ.  Both leads are visualized on the current
 study.  Presumed mitral valve clips are also seen projecting over the heart. 
 No pneumothorax seen.  There are large bilateral pleural effusions with
 associated compressive atelectasis.  These appear grossly stable when compared
 to the prior studies.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The tip of
 the Dobhoff tube is not visualized on the frontal projection but is seen to be
 in the expected location of the stomach on the lateral view
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Expected appearances following transvenous pacemaker placement.
 
 The tip of the Dobhoff tube is not visualized on the AP view but appears to be
 in the stomach on the lateral projection.
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
