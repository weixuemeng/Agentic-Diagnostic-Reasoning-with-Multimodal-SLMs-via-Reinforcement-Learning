                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:33 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest tubes after VATS.  One chest tube
 discontinued today.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Slightly lower lung volumes and mild interstitial edema probably account for
 slight increase in generalized opacification throughout the lungs, partially
 obscuring multiple lung nodules.  Mild cardiomegaly stable.  ET tube and right
 internal jugular line are in standard placements.  Right apical pleural drain
 remains.  Apex is obscured by external wires, if there is any apical
 pneumothorax, it would be very small.  Basal pleural tube still remains.
