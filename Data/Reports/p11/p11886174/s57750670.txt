 and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with which
 contains mural atherosclerotic calcifications.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.  The hilar contours are normal.  A right-sided pectoral implanted
 single lead pacer is unchanged in position.  Again noted are multiple
 bilateral calcified pleural plaques.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 2. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Multiple calcified pleural plaques suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
