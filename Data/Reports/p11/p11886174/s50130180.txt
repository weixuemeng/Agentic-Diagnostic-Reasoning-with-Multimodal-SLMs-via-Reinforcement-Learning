                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PTX.  Assess progression of PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___
 CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No interval change since radiograph performed 4 hours prior.  Again seen are
 well inflated lungs.  Persistent heterogeneous granular opacities within
 bilateral lung bases noted.  Lucencies projecting along the right costophrenic
 angle and lateral right pleural surface are consistent with blebs.  Pleural
 plaques again noted.  There is evidence of severe emphysema.  Persistent
 moderate left basilar pneumothorax is unchanged in size or appearance.  No
 pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 Aortic arch calcifications are present.  A right anterior chest wall pacer
 device with single lead tip within right ventricle again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No significant change in moderate left basilar pneumothorax.
 2.  Severe emphysema
 3.  Progression of bibasilar opacities are worrisome for aspiration or
 aspiration pneumonia
 4.  Pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestosis exposure.
