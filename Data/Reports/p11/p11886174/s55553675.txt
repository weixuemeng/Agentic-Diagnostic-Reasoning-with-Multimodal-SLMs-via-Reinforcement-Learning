  1. Stable moderate left basilar pneumothorax. 2. Evidence of severe emphysema
  with right costophrenic and lateral right pleural blebs. 3.  Increased
  bibasilar opacities are worrisome for aspiration or aspiration pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with large ptx.  Assess for progression of ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast ___, chest radiograph ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated.  Increased heterogeneous granular opacities
 within bilateral lung bases.  Lucencies projecting along the right
 costophrenic angle and along lateral right pleural surface may represent
 blebs.  Pleural plaques again noted.  There is evidence of severe emphysema. 
 Persistent moderate left basilar pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.  No
 significant change since prior examination.  Heart size, mediastinal contour,
 and hila are unremarkable.  Aortic arch calcifications are present.  A right
 anterior chest wall pacer device with single lead tip within the right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable moderate left basilar pneumothorax.
 2.  Evidence of severe emphysema with right costophrenic and lateral right
 pleural blebs.
 3.  Increased bibasilar opacities are worrisome for aspiration or aspiration
 pneumonia.
 4.  Pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestosis exposure.
