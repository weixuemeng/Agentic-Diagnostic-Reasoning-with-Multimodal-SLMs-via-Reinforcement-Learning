                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:38.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with motor vehicle collision and grade 5
 splenic laceration.  Check nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:14.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 13:38, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval repositioning of the nasogastric tube with the tip projecting over
 the stomach but the side port is near the gastroesophageal junction. 
 Advancing would be advised to ensure that the side port is below the
 gastroesophageal junction to minimize the risk of aspiration.  Small amount of
 free intraperitoneal air is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm in this
 patient status post recent laparotomy.  Lungs appear inflated with minimal
 patchy opacity at the left base likely reflecting an area of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
