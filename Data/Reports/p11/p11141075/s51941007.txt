                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with AMS  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  ___ chest x-ray and
 chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted on current exam. Increased interstitial markings
 are seen throughout the lungs which could be due to chronic underlying
 interstitial process. Patient status post prior right upper lobectomy.
 Increased opacity projecting over the right lung apex is unchanged from prior
 and is likely in part post surgical in nature. Nodular right mid lung opacity
 is unchanged dating back to ___. There are more conspicuous
 bibasilar opacities laterally. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 Right chest wall single lead pacing device is noted. Prior right thoracotomy
 changes are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities could be secondary to atelectasis
 although infection would be possible. Consider PA and lateral to further
 characterize if patient is amenable
