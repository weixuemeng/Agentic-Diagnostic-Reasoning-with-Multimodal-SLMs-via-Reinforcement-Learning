                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:33 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent pacemaker revision, now hypotensive. 
 Any signs of tamponade or CHF?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:36 p.m.
 
 Position of the current right ventricular transvenous subclavian line from the
 right pectoral pacemaker via a subclavian approach, is standard, though more
 proximal than the previous lead which passed at least as far as the cardiac
 apex.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or widening of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette to suggest tamponade.  Lung volumes have
 improved.  There is no pulmonary edema or particular vascular engorgement 
 currently.
