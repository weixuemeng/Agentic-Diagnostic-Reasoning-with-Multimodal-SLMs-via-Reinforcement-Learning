 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:55 PM
  Left PICC terminates at the distal SVC/high cavoatrial.  Otherwise minimal
  improvement of the right and lateral left base opacities though this may be
  due to difference in technique. Diffuse osteopenia. Otherwise no relevant
  change.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PICC placed, but placement of wire difficult to tell on
 Portable CXR due to concurrent pacer wire and rotation of film.  // PICC in
 place?     PICC in place?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ and
 ___ 3:03 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Right trans subclavian pacer lead follows
 its expected course to the right ventricular apex.
 
 Lung volumes are very low exaggerating moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild edema best appreciated when compared to ___.
 
 Of greatest concern is the region of opacity at the right lung base now
 looking more like a discrete, 3-4 cm lung mass.  The heterogeneous
 opacification of the left lung base is also unexplained.  All findings would
 be elucidated by chest CT scanning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 8:27 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings. 5
