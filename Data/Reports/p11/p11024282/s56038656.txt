                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICD placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of ___, the tip of the ICD
 extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region most likely represents
 lower lobe atelectatic changes.
