                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post endovascular aortic repair. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube tip lies 3.1 cm above the carina.  An enteric feeding
 tube courses below the diaphragm, out of field of view.  A right internal
 jugular approach central venous catheter tip projects within the right atrium.
 There are persistent low lung volumes with worsening bibasilar
 atelectasis/partial collapse.  There are no large pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 demonstrating a left ventricular configuration of the heart.  The heart is
 within the upper limits of normal in size.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 increased. An endovascular aortic graft is demonstrated projecting over the
 mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Support hardware positioning as above with the right internal jugular tip
 projecting in the right atrium and unchanged position of the endotracheal
 tube.
 2. Worsening bibasilar atelectasis/collapse.
