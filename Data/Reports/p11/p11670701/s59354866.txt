 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after liver wedge
 resection, worsening dyspnea.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to pre-operative study
 from ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been upper zone re-distribution of the
 pulmonary vasculature as well as development of bilateral pleural effusion and
 bibasal consolidations.  The findings might represent a combination of
 pulmonary edema with bilateral aspiration.  Infectious process is a
 possibility and should be re-assessed after diuresis.
