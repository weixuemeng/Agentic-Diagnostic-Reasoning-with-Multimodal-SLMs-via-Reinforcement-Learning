 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with n/v  // ?PNA

 The extensive right lung changes, present on the previous radiograph, are not
 substantially increased. However, the nodular and masslike aspect of the upper
 rounded component of the changes, adjacent to the right upper mediastinum, is
 slightly increased.  The lateral radiograph shows that, at least a part of the
 opacities are caused by fissural thickening.  In any way, however, CT should
 be used to further clarify the nature and origin of the changes which were not
 present on a previous CT examination performed in ___.  This information was
 added to the radiology dashboard at the time of dictation and observation.
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
