                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is minimal left base atelectasis.  Subcentimeter calcified nodular opacities
 projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung most likely represent calcified
 granulomas.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous/unfolded.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left base atelectasis.  Calcified right pulmonary nodules
 likely representing calcified granulomas.  No focal consolidation.
