 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Schizophrenia , productive cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no evidence of pneumonia,chf
 or pleural effusion.  A rounded opacity projecting between the sixth and
 seventh lateral left ribs is not seen in prior studies and could be outside
 the patient.  This study is not tailored to evaluate rib fractures.  If
 patient has local pain, dedicated rib series is recommended.
