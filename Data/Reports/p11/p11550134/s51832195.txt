                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, status post flexible bronchoscopy,
 bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial needle aspiration of a left hilar
 mass, now with stridor and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  FDG PET CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal portable views of the chest were obtained.  A new
 moderate-sized left pneumothorax is present without evidence of tension. 
 Generalized increased opacity of the left lung, greater than expected for the
 degree of volume loss, may represent lavage fluid, although post-procedural
 hemorrhage is not excluded.  A large left hilar mass is similar in size to
 ___, allowing for differences in modality.  Linear opacities at
 the right lung base are compatible with atelectasis.  No pleural effusion is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No radiopaque foreign
 body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New moderate-sized left pneumothorax without radiographic evidence of
 tension.  
 2.  Diffusely increased opacity of the left lung is greater than expected for
 the degree of volume loss, and may represent bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or
 post-procedural hemorrhage.  
 3.  Large left hilar mass.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to Dr. ___ at
 16:10 p.m. on ___, one minute after discovery of the findings
 at 16:09 p.m.
