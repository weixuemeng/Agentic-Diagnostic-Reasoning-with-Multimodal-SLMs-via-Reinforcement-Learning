                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST DATED, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left juxtahilar mass appears slightly smaller than on the ___ chest radiograph and is known to be associated with obstruction of
 left upper lobe bronchus on interval CT of ___.  Moderate-sized
 left pleural effusion with loculated components laterally and apically appear
 similar.  Persistent leftward mediastinal shift with stable cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Slightly hyperexpanded right lung appears grossly clear with no new
 areas of consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in size of left juxtahilar mass with persistent moderate
 partially loculated left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  No new areas of consolidation to suggest an acute pneumonia.
