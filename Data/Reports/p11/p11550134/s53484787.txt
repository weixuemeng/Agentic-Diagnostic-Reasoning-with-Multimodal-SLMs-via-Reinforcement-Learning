                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post endobronchial ultrasound,
 complicated by left-sided pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement on
 ___.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  The AP single
 radiograph demonstrates unchanged position of the previously described small
 caliber pigtail ending pleural drainage catheter.  There is no evidence of any
 remaining apical pneumothorax.  However, hazy density occupying the entire
 left side hemithorax and elevated diaphragm is suggestive of pleural effusions
 layering in the posterior pleural spaces.  The right hemithorax is
 unremarkable as before.
