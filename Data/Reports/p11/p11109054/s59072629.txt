                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted with streaky bibasilar opacities most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection however is not completely excluded.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple right axillary clips are again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities in this setting of low lung volumes could
 reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.
