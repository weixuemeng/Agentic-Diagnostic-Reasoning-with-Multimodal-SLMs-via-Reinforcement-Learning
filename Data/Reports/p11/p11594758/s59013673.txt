                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.   No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The patient is considerably rotated.  There are low inspiratory volumes. 
 Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged, though there may be a left
 ventricular configuration.  Possible minimal retrocardiac opacity.  The right
 lung is grossly clear. No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax identified.  
 
 Unusual density over the left scapula - ? secondary to trauma vs artifact due
 to something overlying the scapula. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Possible patchy opacity left base. Given low lung volumes, this may be
 atelectasis. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to assess for
 focal infiltrate in this location.  
 
 2) Otherwise, doubt acute pulmonary process.  
 
 3) Unusual density ocver left scapula -- ? artifact. Please see comment.
