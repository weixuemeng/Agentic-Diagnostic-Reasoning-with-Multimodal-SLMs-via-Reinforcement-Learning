                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RIJ replaced  // line R IJ adjustment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the interval since the prior study the right internal jugular catheter has
 been withdrawn, the tip is now in the proximal to mid SVC.  No pneumothorax
 seen.  There is persistent hyperinflation of the lung but with bilateral
 pleural effusions versus scarring, larger on the right than the left.  This is
 unchanged compared to the earlier study.  There is associated atelectasis in
 the right middle and lower lobes.  Compared to the preoperative study there is
 increased airspace opacity in the right upper lung.  A clip is seen projecting
 over the calcified mitral valve annulus.  Heart size is unchanged compared to
 the prior study, moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right internal jugular catheter now terminates in the mid SVC.
