                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MVR s/p PA catheter place,eng  // PA.
 Catheter placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter.  The tip is in the
 right pulmonary artery, the edge of the mediastinum is difficult to evaluate
 due to the moderately large pleural effusion, however based on the
 relationship to the more proximal portion of the Swan-Ganz catheter, this is
 likely in appropriate position.  There is a moderately large right pleural
 effusion, unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is associated
 compressive atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion versus pleural scarring.
 The lungs are otherwise clear except note mild hyperinflation.  Mitral valve
 calcification and a mitral valve clip are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Swan-Ganz catheter, the tip positioned in the right pulmonary artery.  It is
 difficult to assess how out into the pulmonary artery this is positioned as
 the mediastinal contours are obscured by a moderately large pleural effusion.
