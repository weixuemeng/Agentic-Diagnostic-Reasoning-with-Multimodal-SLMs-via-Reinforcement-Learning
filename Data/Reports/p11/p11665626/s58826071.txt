                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD on HD, new hypoxemia s/p intubation //
 ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CTA
 chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since CT chest of ___ there has been considerable worsening of
 bilateral upper lobe predominant opacities, right greater than left.  Heart
 size is top normal.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Posterior spinal fusion hardware is re- demonstrated.  ET tube terminates 4.9
 cm from the carina.  Vascular stents project over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube 4.9 cm from the carina.
 2. Severe worsening of bilateral upper lobe predominant airspace opacities,
 right greater than left, are likely accounted for by severe pulmonary edema. A
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded and repeat radiographs after
 diuresis/hemodialysis are recommended.
