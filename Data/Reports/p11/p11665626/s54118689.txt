                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intuabted  // opacity, lines      opacity, lines
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 ET tube tip less than 4 cm from the carina, standard position with the chin
 flexed.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into a nondistended stomach and out
 of view.
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  There is a greater opacification generally,
 particularly in the right lower and left midlung zones.  This could represent
 deposition of cardiogenic edema, or worsened micro atelectasis if positive
 pressure ventilator support has been decreased.  Alternatively could represent
 recurrence of the previously improved general pulmonary abnormality.
 
 Heart size remains normal, mediastinal veins are greater caliber but not over
 distended is suggesting increase in intravascular volume.  Pleural effusions
 small if any.  No pneumothorax.
