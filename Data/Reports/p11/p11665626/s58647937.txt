 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 03:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 11:03
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, left subclavian
 central line, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  Left subclavian
 venous stent remains in place.  There has been interval placement of a right
 chest tube with appearance of subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral
 chest wall soft tissues.  No obvious pneumothorax is seen.  Hardware is seen
 overlying the thoracic spine.  No change in bilateral diffuse airspace process
 consistent with a diffuse infection or ARDS.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation.  Cystic changes
 in the right humeral head likely are degenerative in etiology.
