 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AFib, fever and hypertension, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette but the diameter of the vasculature
 in the lungs has decreased, reflecting decrease in pulmonary edema.  Moderate
 atelectasis at the left lung bases.  No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
