                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with glioblastoma of the brain, mental
 status changes with new oxygen requirement.  Etiology of new oxygen
 requirement is questioned.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's physical condition required examination in sitting
 semi-upright position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is
 made with the next preceding single view chest examination of ___.  Heart size appears unchanged paying attention to geometric distortion
 with patient in sitting position.  No pulmonary vascular congestion.  On the
 right lung base, a new infiltrate is seen coinciding with blunting of the
 right lateral pleural sinus.  Lateral view locates the parenchymal density
 into the posterior segment of the right lower lobe.  Amount of pleural
 effusion appears to be very small as it only blunts mildly the posterior
 pleural sinus. Drooping head and chin obscure apical area on frontal view and
 makes it difficult to exclude any significant pneumothorax. A significant
 pneumothorax, however, is unlikely considering the normal distribution of
 pulmonary vasculature in the mid portion of the lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Parenchymal infiltrate in right lower lobe posterior segment.
 Probably aspiration pneumonitis in this mentally compromised patient. 
 Referring physician, ___. ___, was paged at 3:10 p.m.
