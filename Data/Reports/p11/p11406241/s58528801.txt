                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment of the lung apices is limited as the patient's chin and neck
 project over and obscure this region.  Heart size remains within normal
 limits.  The aorta is tortuous.  Lungs again demonstrate changes compatible
 COPD with flattening of the diaphragms and hyperinflation.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities are re- demonstrated, and most likely reflect atelectasis.  Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles on the lateral view posteriorly likely reflect
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is
 demonstrated.  No large pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited assessment of the lung apices.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.
