                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Intubated post-op.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This is a rotated film.  The ET tube is 3.5 cm above the carina. 
 Right IJ line tip is in the SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged and there are hazy bilateral alveolar infiltrates with ill
 defined pulmonary vasculature compatible fluid overload.  The left heart
 border is obscured and it is unclear if this is due to
 effusion/infiltrate/volume loss.  There is no pneumothorax.
