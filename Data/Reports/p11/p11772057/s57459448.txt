                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with vomiting, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, now resolved
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are coarse interstitial markings bilaterally with bibasilar fibrosis
 likely representing chronic interstitial lung disease.  This opacification is
 slightly asymmetrically increased at the left base, which may represent
 asymmetric fibrosis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 There is biapical pleural parenchymal scarring.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Coarse interstitial markings bilaterally with bibasilar fibrosis, likely
 reflecting chronic interstitial lung disease.
 2. Asymmetric opacification at the left base may represent asymmetric
 fibrosis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
