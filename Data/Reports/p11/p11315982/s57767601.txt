                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Recent seizures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier on the same evening.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 courses into the stomach, its inferior course not imaged.  There is a somewhat
 increased retrocardiac opacity suggesting atelectasis and probably a
 coinciding small pleural effusion.  There is no pleural effusion on the right.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation with endotracheal tube terminating 5 cm
 above the carina.  Left basilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis,
 including a suspected small pleural effusion; however other etiologies such as
 developing pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis are not excluded by this
 examination.
