 w/dislodged OG, replaced. please eval placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 06:55.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is 4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the inferior
 field of view.   Degree of pulmonary edema appears improved, potentially due
 to slightly improved lung volumes when compared to prior.  Persistent streaky
 bibasilar opacities, left greater than right could be atelectasis although
 continued followup will be necessary as infection or aspiration are possible.
