                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, vomiting; evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Pre-op radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  There is mild prominence of the interstitium
 which may be technical; however, the possibility of mild edema is difficult to
 exclude.  There is evidence of old left humeral head injury.  No acute
 skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild prominence of the interstitium may be technical; however,
 the possibility of mild pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.  Recommend
 clinical correlation.
