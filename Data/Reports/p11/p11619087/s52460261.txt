                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with urosepsis  // Confirm CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 03:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant.  There has been
 interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter which
 terminates in the lower SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Mild interstitial edema persists.  Patchy
 left base retrocardiac opacity is again seen which may be due to atelectasis
 although infection or aspiration are not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No large pleural effusion is seen although small pleural effusion,
 particularly on the left, difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Again seen patchy left base retrocardiac opacity which may be due to
 atelectasis, although infection or aspiration not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Persistent mild interstitial edema.
