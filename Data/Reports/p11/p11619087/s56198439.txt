 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is
 accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial
 edema.  Hazy increased opacity in right mid and lower lung could reflect a
 layering effusion on this semi-upright study, but it is difficult to exclude
 underlying consolidation at the right lung base.  Followup radiographs after
 diuresis may be helpful in this regard.  Small left pleural effusion is also
 noted.
