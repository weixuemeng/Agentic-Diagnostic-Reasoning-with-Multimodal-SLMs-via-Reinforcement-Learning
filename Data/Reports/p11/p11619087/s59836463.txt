                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute kidney injury, possible
 pneumonia/pleural effusion.  Please assess for interval improvement in chest
 x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest shows minimal increase of right basilar
 paracardial opacification, this area might be due to vascular congestion,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be considered. 
 Heart size is still top normal with prominent hila. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacification is minimally increased since prior
 and may be still compatible with vascular congestion, considering prominent
 hila, although in the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be
 considered.
