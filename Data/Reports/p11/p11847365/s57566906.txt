 pneumothorax.  Prior fractures involving the right posterior fourth and fifth
 ribs appear healed, having evolved since the prior study with remodeling. 
 Less well characterized lateral right-sided rib deformities are probably
 unchanged.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Healed right-sided rib
 fractures.
