 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:56 AM
  Since ___:00, lung volumes have increased but bilateral alveolar opacities have
  worsened, particularly in the upper lobes.  Although diffuse alveolar
  opacities are nonspecific, the rapid progression and sparing of the lateral
  lung apices is most suspicious for worsening pulmonary edema.  Moderate to
  large bilateral pleural effusions.  D/w Dr ___ ___ phone at ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Critical aortic stenosis, pulmonary edema, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:54 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 further decreased.  The crowding of the vascular structures is increased as
 compared to the previous image.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and signs of
 moderate to severe pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pneumothorax.
