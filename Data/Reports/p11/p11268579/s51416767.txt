                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
 rate.  Feeling unwell.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, there has
 been significant interval improvement of the previously seen pulmonary edema
 which has resolved.  Minimal blunting of the lateral and posterior
 costophrenic angles likely due to trace effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but not moreso than on prior.  Enlarged hila are compatible with
 pulmonary arterial enlargement in a setting of pulmonary hypertension. 
 Ascending aortic prosthesis is again seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Significant improvement of previously seen pulmonary edema with probable trace
 residual effusions.  No focal consolidation.
