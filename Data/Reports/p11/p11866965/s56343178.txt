                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Previously demonstrated
 multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities have largely resolved with only
 minimal residual opacity seen in the right lower lobe. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are mild degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously noted multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities have largely
 resolved.  No concerning focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, and no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
