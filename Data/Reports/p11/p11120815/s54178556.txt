                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are decreased.  The heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There are increased interstitial
 markings most pronounced at the lung bases, which could be reflective of a
 chronic interstitial lung disease, though a superimposed infectious process in
 the left lung base is difficult to exclude.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is definitively noted.  Minimal degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings most pronounced at the lung
 bases, which could reflect an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  A
 superimposed infectious process in the left lung base is difficult to exclude.
