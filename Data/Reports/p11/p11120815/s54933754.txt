                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with falls, confusion, platelet count of 35
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Hilar contours are similar.  Previously noted pulmonary edema has
 substantially improved with only minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
 remaining.  Calcified granulomas are re- demonstrated within the right upper
 lobe.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect chronic interstitial
 abnormality.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes seen in the
 thoracic spine.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with only minimal residual mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild chronic interstitial abnormality at the
 lung bases.
