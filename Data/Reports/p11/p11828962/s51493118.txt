                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation.  Low lung volumes accentuate cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Perihilar and basilar opacities
 are relatively similar allowing for differences in lung volumes, and may
 reflect multifocal aspiration pneumonia given clinical history of aspiration
 event.  Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
