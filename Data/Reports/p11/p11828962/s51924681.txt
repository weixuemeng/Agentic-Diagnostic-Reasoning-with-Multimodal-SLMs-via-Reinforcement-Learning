                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:37 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after VATS for left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: 
 
 ET tube, 2 cm above the carina, previously in the right main bronchus,would
 have required re-positioning, but I have been informed that it has been
 removed since this radiograph was performed.  Three left pleural tubes are
 still in place, and only a small left pleural effusion persists.  Tiny left
 apical pneumothorax is not clinically significant.  Left lower lobe
 opacification, probably atelectasis, unchanged.
