                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Aspiration during intubation, cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Right PICC ends in the low SVC.
 Better lung volumes.  Previously seen bibasilar atelectasis is resolved. 
 Right upper lobe opacities have decreased, likely representing some residual
 evidence of aspiration.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The splenic flexure of the colon is
 air-filled with an air-fluid level.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral perihilar and basilar opacities have decreased with
 some persistent right upper lobe opacities. Small bilateral pleural effusions
 have decreased.  Splenic flexure of the colon is air-filled with an air-fluid
 level, suggesting stasis, correlate clinically.
