                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with worsening SOB, cough, and fever. Currently on
 outpatient PO antibiotics for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.
 
 Probable mild cardiomegaly.  Slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt
 CHF.
 
 There is dense confluent opacity at the left base laterally, with obscuration
 of the lateral aspect of the hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle.
 
 There is also small area of patchy opacification at the right base, laterally
 
 Lateral view shows small posterior pleural effusion, probably on the left.
 
 4 mm nodule projecting over the retrosternal clear space on the lateral view
 appears new compared with chest x-rays from ___ and which may be
 followed up with a chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dense opacity at the left base lateral, probably with an associated small
 effusion.  The appearance is compatible with pneumonia.  Some of this
 opacification appears nodular, and should be followed up with a chest CT or a
 repeat chest radiograph in ___ weeks to ensure resolution.
 2. Small focus of patchy opacification at the right base lateral, this is
 similar to ___ and could represent an area of focal scarring.  Attention
 to this area on followup films is requested.
 3. 4 mm nodule projecting over the retrosternal clear space, new compared with
 ___, which should be followed up with a chest CT.
 4. Hyperinflated lungs, consistent with COPD
 5. Mild cardiomegaly.  No overt CHF.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest CT is recommended for evaluation of the
 slightly nodular consolidation at the left base to ensure resolution and to
 evaluate the retrosternal clear space nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 22:35 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
