                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain, question STEMI.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax or large effusions.  Retrocardiac opacities could be atelectasis
 but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Lateral projection is
 recommended for further evaluation.
