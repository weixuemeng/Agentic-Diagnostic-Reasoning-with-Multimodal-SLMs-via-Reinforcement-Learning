                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left chest wall pain after fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with radiopaque
 markers placed at the site of patient's pain.  Healed fractures are seen in
 the nearby lateral ribs (as there are in posterior right middle ribs), and
 there is mild increase in thickening of the lateral costal pleurae just
 superiorly, but no acute  fracture is identified.  Nevertheless, rib detail
 views of the region would be more conclusive.  The lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No fracture.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
