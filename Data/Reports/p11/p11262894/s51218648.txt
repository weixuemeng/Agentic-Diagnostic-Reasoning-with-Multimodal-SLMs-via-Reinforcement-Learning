                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p Whipple // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasalar atelectasis is unchanged.
 The left-sided pleural effusion has increased slightly over the interval. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax. A
 right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the cavoatrial
 junction. The left-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the proximal right atrium.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 6 cm from the carina.  In nasogastric tube courses into
 the stomach and out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slight increase in left pleural effusion. Stable bibasalar atelectasis.
 2. The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm from the carina, which is acceptable if the
 patient's chin is in the neutral or elevated position, but is too high if the
 chin is low.
