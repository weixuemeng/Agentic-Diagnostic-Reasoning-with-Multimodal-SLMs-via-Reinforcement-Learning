 adenovirus  // please evaluate for changes      please evaluate for changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly
 better inspiration.  The monitoring and support devices are stable.  The
 degree of opacification in the right hemithorax appears to have decreased,
 though much of this could merely represent the better inspiration.  Poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm on the right is consistent with layering
 pleural fluid.
 The opacification at the left base has decreased and most likely represents
 atelectasis.
