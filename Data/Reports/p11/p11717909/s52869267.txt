 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, moderate right pleural effusion is mildly improved and

 but could represent pneumonia in the right clinical setting. The left lung
 remains clear.  Enlarged appearing heart may be technical from persistence of
 low lung volumes.  Unchanged positioning of right internal jugular central

 pneumothorax.
