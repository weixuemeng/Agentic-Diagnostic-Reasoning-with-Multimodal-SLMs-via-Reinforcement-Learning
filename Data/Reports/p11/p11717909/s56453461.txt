                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart transplant and sepsis remains
 intubated and requires post-pyloric feeding tube.  // placement of dobhoff
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph from earlier today, a feeding tube is been placed
 within the stomach and a pre-existing nasogastric tube remains in place as
 well.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for persistent widespread airspace
 opacities with relative sparing of the left upper lobe.  Since a recent
 radiograph, this has slightly improved in the right upper lobe and worsened in
 the left lower lobe.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated,
 right greater than left.
