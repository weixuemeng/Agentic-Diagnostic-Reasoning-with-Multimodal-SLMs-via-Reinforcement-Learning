 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right subclavian PICC line is
 again in the right atrium.  To be at or just above the cavoatrial junction,
 the tube could be pulled back about 4 cm.  The heterogeneous opacification in
 the right mid zone may be slightly improved.  However, there is increasing
 opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying
 atelectasis.
