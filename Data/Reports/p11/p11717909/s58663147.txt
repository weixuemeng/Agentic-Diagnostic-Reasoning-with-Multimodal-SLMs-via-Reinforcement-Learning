 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:22 AM
  
  
  
  Essentially unchanged multifocal consolidation in the right upper and lower
  lobes.  The left lung is largely clear aside from the left lung base, which is
  partially opacified likely as a result of atelectasis given the elevation of
  the left hemidiaphragm since the prior radiograph.
