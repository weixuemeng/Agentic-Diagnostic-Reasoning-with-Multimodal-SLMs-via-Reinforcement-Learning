 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal pulmonary consolidation, most pronounced in the right lung, also at

 decreased atelectasis and perhaps resolution of a component of pulmonary edema
 and decrease in moderate right pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 remains.
