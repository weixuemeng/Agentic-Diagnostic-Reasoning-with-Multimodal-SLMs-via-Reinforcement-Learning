                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p heartmate // assess for infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. The heart remains stably enlarged. 
 There is dense left basilar opacification, which may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia, but is not significantly changed from prior. Median sternotomy
 wires and a left ventricular assist device are in place.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
 is present with the tip ending in the right pulmonary artery, but its ifnerior
 loop in the right atium appears to be subluxing into the IVC. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable dense left basilar opacification may represent atelectasis, however
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 pulmonary edema.
