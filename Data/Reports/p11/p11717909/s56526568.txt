 repositioning      eval for dobhoff tube tip s/p repositioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this day, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed. The tip of the Dobbhoff to appears to be in the distal stomach.
 Otherwise little change.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm persists, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
