                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Volume overload and acute kidney injury after PVI. Evaluate for
 congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, small bilateral pleural effusions have increased in
 size.  There is mild associated dependent atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal in size. Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. There is a
 moderate-to-severe scoliosis with an associated asymmetry of the rib cage.
 Increased density at the right apex is likely due to a summation of
 overlapping shadows related to the patient's scoliosis and rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in the size of small bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
