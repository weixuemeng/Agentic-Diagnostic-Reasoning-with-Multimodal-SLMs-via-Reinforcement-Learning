                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with palpitations. Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated in keeping with history of emphysema.  Asymmetric
 right apical calcified scarring is unchanged. Lingular nodular opacities were
 better seen on prior CT. No new focal opacities are seen. Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours unremarkable. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is
 secondary to flattening of the hemidiaphragms. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs. No evidence of pneumonia.  Nodular opacities not as
 clearly seen on this exam as on prior chest CT and followup recommenditions
 are per prior CT report.
