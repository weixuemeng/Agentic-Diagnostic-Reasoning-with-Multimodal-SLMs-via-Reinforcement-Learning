                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with bilateral lower extremity edema,
 assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are again noted.  There are bilateral pleural effusions,
 small, with associated mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  There is likely
 mild basilar atelectasis.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear grossly
 unchanged, though patient rotation to the right limits the evaluation of the
 mediastinum.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild edema with small bilateral effusions with lower lobe
 compressive atelectatic change.
