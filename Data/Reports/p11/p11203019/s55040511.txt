  The endotracheal tube terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. The right IJ CVL
  terminates in the upper SVC. Compared to the baseline examination, there is
  cardiomegaly, moderate pulmonary edema, and a small left pleural effusion. The
  appearance is most consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure,
  although noncardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema, such as ARDS, cannot be
  excluded based on imaging alone.
