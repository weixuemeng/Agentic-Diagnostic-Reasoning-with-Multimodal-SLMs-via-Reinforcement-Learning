                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall and head strike.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 Evaluation of the upper thoracic spine is limited by the overlying soft
 tissues on the lateral view.  A lower thoracic vertebral body which is
 incompletely evaluated demonstrates a very mild loss of anterior vertebral
 body height.  The remainder of the vertebral body heights are maintained. 
 There is no evidence of malalignment.  There is no evidence of a rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No definite fracture; mild loss of anterior vertebral body height in the
 lower thoracic vertebral body could be projectional or degenerative.  If high
 clinical concern for a fracture at this level exists, consider further
 evaluation with a CT.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 6:00 AM on ___ via telephone by
