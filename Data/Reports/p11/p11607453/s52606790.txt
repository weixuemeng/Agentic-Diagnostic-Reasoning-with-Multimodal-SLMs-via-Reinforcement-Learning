 Any interval change in effusions? pulm edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is extensive
 opacification at the bases, more prominent on the right, consistent with
 layering effusions and basilar atelectasis. Although the appearance suggests
 some improvement, this could merely be a manifestation of a more erect
 position of the patient.  The upper lungs remain clear. Pacer leads are
 unchanged.
