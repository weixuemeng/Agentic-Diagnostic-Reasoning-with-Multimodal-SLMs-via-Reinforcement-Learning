                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, anticoagulated, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminate in the
 right atrium right ventricle.  Heart size is enlarged, but difficult to
 precisely determined given the presence of a moderate size right and small
 left bilateral pleural effusions.  The right pleural effusion appears
 increased in size compared to the prior study.  There is mild pulmonary edema,
 perhaps worse in the interval, with bibasilar opacities, likely compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.  There are moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, with increased size of
 moderate right pleural effusion and similar small left pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
