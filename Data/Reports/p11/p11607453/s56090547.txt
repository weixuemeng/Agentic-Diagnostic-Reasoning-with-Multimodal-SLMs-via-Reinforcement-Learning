                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, denies shortness of breath or chest pain.  Rule out
 pneumothorax, rule out any other acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with at calcified,
 unfolded, and slightly tortuous aorta.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  Prominence of the pulmonary hila is noted and could
 reflect the presence of an element of pulmonary hypertension.  There are small
 bilateral effusions, larger on the right.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Aside from minimal atelectasis at the bases, no focal consolidation is
 identified.  The possibility of a small posterior infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude in the setting of effusions, but is considered unlikely. 
 
 
 Note is made of osteopenia, mild degenerative change, minimal anterior wedging
 of mid thoracic vertebral body, and dense ossification of the anterior
 longitudinal ligament.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD, cardiomegaly, suspected pulmonary hypertension, and pacemaker noted,
 similar to ___.  
 
 2.  Small bilateral effusions which are new compared with the earlier film. No
 obvious focal infiltrate.  Subtle poserior infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded, but is considered less likely.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution similar to the prior film.  No overt CHF.
