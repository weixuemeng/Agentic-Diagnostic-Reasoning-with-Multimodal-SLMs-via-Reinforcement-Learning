                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with increased cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is extensive
 fibrotic change in the right mid zone with opacification in the right hilum
 that could represent radiation therapy.  In the absence of any previous
 postoperative or post-therapeutic image, it is difficult to determine whether
 any of the opacification in this area could reflect an acute pneumonia. 
 However, the remainder of the chest is clear, with no evidence of pneumonia
 elsewhere or vascular congestion.
