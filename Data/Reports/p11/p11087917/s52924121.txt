                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with tachypnea, hx of pleural effusions, lung CA  // eval
 for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior chest x-ray, there has been interval increase in size of the
 right-sided pleural effusion although given differences in technique it has
 not dramatically changed since interval CT scan. The right pleural catheter is
 in unchanged position. There is no visualized pneumothorax. The left lung
 remains clear without consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is difficult to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion which given differences in technique is not
 significantly changed since recent CT scan. Underlying consolidation due to
 some combination of atelectasis and known mass is difficult to assess.
 Superimposed infection can not be excluded.
