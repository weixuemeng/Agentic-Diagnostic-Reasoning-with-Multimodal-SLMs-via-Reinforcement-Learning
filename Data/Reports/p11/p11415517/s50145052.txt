                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with eosinophil fasciitis with sepsis.  // Please
 evaluate for consolidation, pleural effusion, acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes comes accentuates the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without definite focal
 consolidation.  Mild basilar atelectasis.  Top-normal to mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette size, likely accentuated by low lung volumes, and portable
 AP technique.
