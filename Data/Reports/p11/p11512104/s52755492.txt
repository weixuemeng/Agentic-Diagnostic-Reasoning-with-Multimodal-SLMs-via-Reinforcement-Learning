                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 17:37
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, here with cough, question
 pneumonia, question volume status.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:03
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 17:37 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains stably enlarged, which most likely reflects
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Lungs appear grossly clear, though somewhat low in volume.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 large effusions.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.  Calcification of the
 aortic knob is consistent with atherosclerosis.
