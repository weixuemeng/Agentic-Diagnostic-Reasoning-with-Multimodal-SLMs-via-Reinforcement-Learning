                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with active lung cancer and pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right chest wall port is
 again seen.  There is right-sided volume loss.  Peaking of the right
 hemidiaphragm laterally is new and raises possibility of subpulmonic effusion.
 Right perihilar and paratracheal opacity presumably due to patient's known
 lung cancer is again seen.  The left lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right subpulmonic effusion.  Consider a decubitus view. 
 Increased density in the right perihilar region grossly unchanged from prior.
