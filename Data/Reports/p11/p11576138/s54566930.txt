                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible aortic aneurysm or dissection.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No acute focal
 pneumonia.
 
 No convincing evidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection in the thoracic
 region.  If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be the next imaging
 procedure.
