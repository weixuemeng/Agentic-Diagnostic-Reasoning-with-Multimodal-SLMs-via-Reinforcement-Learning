                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax or infiltrate in a patient with chest
 pain and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax, although the left lung apex
 is obscured by an overlying lead.  Mild peribronchial wall thickening and
 streaky perihilar opacities can be seen in the setting of reactive or small
 airway disease.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild peribronchial wall thickening in streaky perihilar opacities, which
 can be seen in the setting of reactive or small airway disease.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.
 2. No appreciable pneumothorax, though the left lung apex is obscured by an
 overlying lead.
