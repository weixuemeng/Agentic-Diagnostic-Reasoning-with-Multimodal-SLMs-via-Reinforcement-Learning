                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Mild
 bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
