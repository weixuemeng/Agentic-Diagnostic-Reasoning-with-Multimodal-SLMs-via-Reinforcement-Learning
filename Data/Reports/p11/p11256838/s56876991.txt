                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, dyspnea and chronic renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear bilaterally on frontal
 radiographs.  On lateral radiograph, there is a poorly defined opacity
 projecting over the heart which cannot be localized on the frontal
 projections.  There are no masses or lesions identified.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  There is mild-to-moderate degenerative change seen along the thoracic
 spine.  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of CHF. Ambiguous opacity projecting over the heart
 on lateral view.  Recommend oblique radiographs to better localize this
 finding, which may represent an infection.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:07 p.m. by ___.
