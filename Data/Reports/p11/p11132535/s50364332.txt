                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia after recent colonoscopy procedure. History of congestive
 heart failure and COPD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart appears at least borderline enlarged. Within
 the limitations of technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours are probably
 within normal limits. Opacification is fairly confluent over the lateral left
 lower lung suggesting pneumonia, or potentially aspiration in the appropriate
 setting; otherwise, lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Focal opacity in the left lower lung suggesting pneumonia, potentially
 aspiration in the appropriate setting.
