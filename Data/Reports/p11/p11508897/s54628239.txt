                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized though the left costophrenic angle is not
 completely included in the field of view.  Cluster of calcifications are seen
 overlying the left lung base.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Cluster of calcifications projecting
 over the left lung base of unclear etiology but unlikely to be of acute
 clinical significance.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Comparison with prior chest imaging is suggested, and if
 none are available, consider dedicated PA and lateral views further assessment
 of the calcifications projecting over the left lung base.
