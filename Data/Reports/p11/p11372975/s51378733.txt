 INDICATION:  ___ yr f with history of rheumatic fever and multiple cardiac
 valvulopathies on Coumadin, now presenting with abdominal pain and concern for
 ischemic bowel, s/p ex-lap with open abdomen (___).  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been
 extubated and a nasogastric tube is been removed.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  New heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base with
 associated bronchial wall thickening could potentially be due to acute
 aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
