 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.  Heart size appears enlarged,
 but may be exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vasculature appears
 mildly prominent, but may be exaggerated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
