                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New stroke resultant dysphagia, now NG tube placement.  Question
 aspiration pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Rotated positioning.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. 
 Compared with earlier the same day (16:46 p.m.), no gross change is
 identified.  There is minimal patchy stranding at the right base medially and
 possible minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate is
 identified.  No effusion is seen.  No CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is prominent with a left ventricular configuration.  The hila are also
 prominent with a tapered configuration, unchanged, which could reflect an
 element of pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal stranding at right base medially and in retrocardiac
 area.  No definite infiltrate.
