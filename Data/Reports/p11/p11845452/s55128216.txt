 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, chest pain, no cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusions.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Linear
 structures at both lung bases, mimicking plate-like atelectasis, are in fact
 caused by calcified costochondral junctions.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.  Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
