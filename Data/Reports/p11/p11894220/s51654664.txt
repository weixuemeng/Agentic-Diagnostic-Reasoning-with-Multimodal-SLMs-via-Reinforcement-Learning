                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  Compared to the prior study, there is even
 more heterogeneous opacity in the left lower lobe, obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour.  There are some new mostly linear opacities at the
 right lung base, likely atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be ruled out. 
 Stable mild cardiomegaly is present. The aoritc knob appears moreprominent on
 this exam, but this is likely an artifact due to slight rotation. Aortic
 calcifications are stable.
 COPD with extensive background bullous change and right apical pleural
 thickening and parenchymal scarring is again noted.  R.L hilar retraction and
 prominent hila with a tapered appearance suggestive of pulmnary hypertension
 again noted.  No pneumothorax or gross pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Worsening left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 2) New opacity in the right lower lobe, etiologies can include aspiration or
 atelectasis.
 3) Severe background COPD, detailed above.
 4) Please see details regarding pulmonary nodular opacities on the report of a
 ___ CT scan.
