                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ileostomy takedown(___) with fever of
 unknown origin  // R/O PNA.  Fever of unknown origin
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, patchy opacity at the left base has increased
 slightly, with slight interval obscuration of the diaphragm.  While this could
 represent progressive atelectasis, the differential diagnosis could include an
 early infiltrate or area of aspiration.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is also seen, though this is not significantly changed.
 
 There is also slight patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region and
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which are similar to the
 prior film.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, which may be accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 No focal infiltrate seen in the upper or mid zones in either lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Changes at the left base are slightly more pronounced
 than on ___.  The possibility of an early infiltrate or area of
 aspiration is in the differential.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  This is likely accentuated by
 low inspiratory volumes.
