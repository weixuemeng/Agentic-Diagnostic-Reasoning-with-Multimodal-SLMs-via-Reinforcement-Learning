                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.5 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this
 supine exam.  There are no displaced fractures visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
