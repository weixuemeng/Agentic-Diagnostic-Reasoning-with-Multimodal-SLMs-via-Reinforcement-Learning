                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after total colectomy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  There is slight interval improvement
 in vascular congestion, although still mild interstitial pulmonary edema is
 present, associated with bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.  The NG tube
 tip passes below the diaphragm, terminating most likely in the stomach.
