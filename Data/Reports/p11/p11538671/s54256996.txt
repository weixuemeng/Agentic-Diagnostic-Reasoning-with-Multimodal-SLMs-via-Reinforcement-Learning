                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, recent pneumonia, assess residual pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP, upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Increasing consolidation in the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia. 
 There may also be a small left pleural effusion.  There is a hyperdense focus
 again seen projecting over the right lower chest wall, likely residing within
 the posterior soft tissues as best seen on the lateral projection.  Also noted
 is a small hyperdense focus in the left axilla.  Coarsened lung markings are
 noted in the right lung, which may reflect mild interstitial edema.  The heart
 size is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is stable with an unfolded
 thoracic aorta.  The imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with consolidation in the left lower lobe
 concerning for pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.
