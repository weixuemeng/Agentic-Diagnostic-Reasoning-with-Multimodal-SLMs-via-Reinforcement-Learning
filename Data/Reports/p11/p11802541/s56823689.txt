                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with low oxygen saturations, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 CT torso from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Lung volumes are low which result in
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Linear opacities at the right base are most likely atelectasis.
 There is blunting of the costophrenic angles, slightly worse on the left,
 possibly due to small pleural effusions or pleural thickening.  A curvilinear
 thin radio-opaque density, possibly a wire, is seen projecting over the right
 hilus. An apparent inferior epicardial wire is unchanged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior study with mild
 cardiomegaly.  A large hiatal hernia is present.   The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and CABG. Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Low lung volumes with atelectasis at the bases. 
 2. Thin curvilinear radio-opaque density projecting over the left hilus, new
 from prior exams. Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
