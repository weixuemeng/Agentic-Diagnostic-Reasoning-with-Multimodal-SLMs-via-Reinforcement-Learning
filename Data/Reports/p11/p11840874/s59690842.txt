                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral upright views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged.  There appears to be mild interstitial edema without effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No definite signs of pneumonia.  A vague nodular left upper
 lobe opacity appears new from prior study, atypical in appearance for
 pneumonia.  Consider non-emergent CT to further assess.
