 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates multi focal
 opacifications consistent with multilobar pneumonia involving largely the
 right hemithorax. There is increased density within bilateral apices for which
 attention on followup is recommended. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise stable. There is no pleural effusion. Patient is status post median
 sternotomy. Wires appear intact. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.

 Multi lobar pneumonia involving at the right hemithorax. In a patient with
 diff and radiographic abnormality, atypical pathogens should be considered.
