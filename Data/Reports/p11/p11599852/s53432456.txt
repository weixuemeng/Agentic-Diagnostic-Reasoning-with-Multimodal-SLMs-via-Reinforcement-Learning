                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CTA chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  Emphysematous changes are seen
 throughout the lungs.  Reticular opacities are seen in the bilateral lower
 lung fields.  Somewhat increased opacity is noted in the right mid lung in
 comparison to the recent CT chest including a peripheral nodular opacity, not
 definitively seen on prior examination.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   New subtle right mid lung opacity, which in the appropriate clinical
 context, may be related to aspiration or pneumonia.
 2.  A more discrete nodular opacity in the right midlung, which may be due to
 the same process.  Follow-up chest radiograph is recommended to document
 resolution and to exclude the less less likely possibility of a lung cancer as
 a cause of this finding.
