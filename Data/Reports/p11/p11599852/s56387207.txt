 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are

 thoracic aorta.  The lungs remain hyperinflated with marked emphysematous
 changes again noted at the upper lobes.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is present without displaced fracture.  Deformity of the right
 proximal humerus is compatible with a remote fracture.
