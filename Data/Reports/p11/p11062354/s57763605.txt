                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 History: Chest pain, low grade fevers.
 
 Findings: PA and lateral view of the chest, no prior.  There is subtle left
 basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis, however, infiltrate is not excluded.
 In addition, there is a 7-mm nodular opacity projecting in the suprahilar
 region on the left.  Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear, costophrenic
 angles are sharp.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis versus infiltrate.  Possible left
 suprahilar nodule.  These findings can be followed up on the upcoming chest
 CT, which has been ordered.
