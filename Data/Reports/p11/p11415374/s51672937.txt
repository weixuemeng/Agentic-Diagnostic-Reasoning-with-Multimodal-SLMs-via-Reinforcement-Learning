                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Two weeks of productive cough, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are large.  The lateral radiograph shows
 additional flattening of the hemidiaphragms, potentially suggestive of
 overinflation, as seen in COPD or asthma.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Lung parenchyma is unremarkable, notably there is no evidence of
 pneumonia or other infectious changes.  No pleural effusions.  No lung nodules
 or masses.
