                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT  // NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:   2 AP views of the chest, labeled as 1 and 2.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 One view # 2, on the tip of the NG tube overlies the gastric fundus.
 
 It is difficult to determine whether a side-port is present.  If present, it
 does not necessarily extend distal to the GE junction.
 
 Otherwise, no definite interval change.
