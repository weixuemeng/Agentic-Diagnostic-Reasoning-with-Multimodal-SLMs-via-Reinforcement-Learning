                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PICC and pulmonary nodules
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the periphery of the left mid lung
 field and right lung base. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is present.  Surgical
 anchors are seen within the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right PICC tip in the low SVC.
 2. Focal peripheral opacities in the left mid lung field and right lung base,
 nonspecific, and could reflect areas of infection, inflammation, or even
 potentially infarction. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Correlation with
 any previous imaging is recommended, and if there is concern for a pulmonary
 embolism, a CT angiogram is recommended.
