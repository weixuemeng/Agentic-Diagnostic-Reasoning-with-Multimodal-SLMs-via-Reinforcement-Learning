                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:05 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with stroke and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating the severity of persistent mild
 interstitial abnormality which I am attributing to pulmonary edema since there
 is some vascular engorgement both peripherally and centrally and some of the
 interstitial abnormality consists of discrete septal (___ B), lines, and
 the heart is mildly enlarged, bigger today than yesterday.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion.
