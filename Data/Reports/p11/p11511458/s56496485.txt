 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with PMHx of CAD with A-fib and
 LBBB, COPD with bronchiectasis, and recent PNA discharged from ___ for

 COMPARISON:  Comparison to previous study dated ___ at 00:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A series of portable upright chest radiographs dated ___ at 16 36
 and ___ 42 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the initial image, the feeding tube is in the right lung.  This was
 subsequently reposition demonstrating the tip of the tube ending in the distal
 esophagus near the GE junction; advancement of the tube should be considered. 
 Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the vasculature and likely
 superimposed mild edema.  More focal patchy opacities in the right mid lung
 and left lower lung may reflect areas of atelectasis or be related to the
 edema; however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Contrast
 is seen within the colon which lies immediately beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm consistent with Chiladiti's.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated by phone to Dr. ___, the
 covering house staff, on ___ at 08:00 at the time of discovery.
