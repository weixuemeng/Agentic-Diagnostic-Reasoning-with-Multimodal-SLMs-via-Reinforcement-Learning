                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left-sided flank
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Multiple rounded
 calcified opacities in the left lower lung correspond to calcified granulomas.
 The right lung is clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Lucency under the right
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with pneumoperitoneum seen on preceding CT abdomen
 and pelvis.  Patient is status post cholecystectomy with surgical clips seen
 in the right upper quadrant.  Partially imaged are air-distended loops of
 bowel, better assessed on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm corresponds to free intraperitoneal
 air seen on preceding CT.  Air-distended loops of bowel are also better
 assessed on the preceding CT.
