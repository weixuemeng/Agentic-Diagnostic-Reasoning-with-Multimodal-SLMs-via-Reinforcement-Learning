                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with malaise and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT of the chest completed at 1:30 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
 
 Focal opacity within the left lung apex corresponds with a pleural-based
 lesion seen on prior CT.   There is borderline upper zone redistribution and
 bibasilar atelectasis. No overt chf, focal consolidation, effusion, or 
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is tracheal deviation to the right secondary to a large mass in the left
 thyroid gland as seen on concurrent CT.  Multiple healed right-sided rib
 fractures are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apical opacity in the left upper lobe corresponding with pleural-based
 mass on current CT.  Please see CT report for details.
 2.  Right tracheal deviation secondary to known left thyroid mass.
