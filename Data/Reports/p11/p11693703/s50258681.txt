                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with PICC placement, reevaluate location.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Left-sided PICC is seen with tip thought to be
 within the proximal SVC, definitely not distally, especially based on the
 lateral view.  Lungs are clear of large confluent consolidation or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left PICC with tip likely in the proximal SVC.  Noting that the
 tip is not well seen, this is also at the approximate location based on the
 lateral view.
