                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent delirium.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The lung
 volumes are low.  The interstitium is mildly prominent suggesting slight
 congestion, but there is no focal opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 A vague nodular opacity projects over the right mid lung along the course of
 teh right posterior seventh rib.  Thin flowing syndesmophytes are present, and
 the bones are probably demineralized to some degree.  Surgical clips project
 over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggestive of slight congestion, but no definite pneumonia.  
 
 2.  Vague density projecting over the right mid lung also overlapping with
 interstitial change in the course of the right posterior seventh rib.  To see
 whether this density may persist and require evaluation as a potential nodule,
 when clinically appropriate, standard PA and lateral views are recommended to
 evaluate further.
 
 The findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:30 pm
 on the same day by telephone.
