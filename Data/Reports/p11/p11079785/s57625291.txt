                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with systemic sclerosis, interstitial lung
 disease with recent neutropenia, presenting with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 There are again seen decreased lung volumes and increased interstitial
 opacities at the lung bases.  These are unchanged and consistent with the
 patient's known interstitial lung disease, previously characterized as
 fibrotic NSIP related to scleroderma.  There is some blunting of the right CP
 angle suggestive of small pleural effusion which is stable.  There is no
 pneumothoraces or new suspicious areas for consolidation.  Heart size is
 within normal limits.
