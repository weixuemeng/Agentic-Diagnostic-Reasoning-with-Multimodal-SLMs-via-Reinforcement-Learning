                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Buttock pain, vomiting and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Decreased lung volumes are redemonstrated.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Coarse
 interstitial opacities in a basal predominant pattern are compatible with the
 patient's underlying chronic interstitial lung disease, previously
 characterized as fibrotic NSIP related to scleroderma on prior CT.  These
 fibrotic changes limit assessment of the underlying lung parenchyma, but no
 new areas of opacification are present to suggest pneumonia.  The pulmonary
 vascularity does not appear engorged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, and no acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial lung disease compatible with fibrotic NSIP
 as characterized on the prior chest CT, without new areas of parenchymal
 opacification identified to suggest pneumonia.
