                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia, masses.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, no significant change in bilateral
 increased interstitial lung markings, basal predominant, consistent with
 fibrosis/ chronic lung disease.  There is persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Slight increase in right basilar
 opacity may be due to overlying minimal edema or acute exacerbation on chronic
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease, indicated by prominent basal predominant
 interstitial lung markings and fibrosis.  Increased opacity at the right lung
 base may be due to acute exacerbation of the chronic process.  Superimposed
 infection is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
