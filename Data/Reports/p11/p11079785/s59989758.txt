                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with 4 days of flu-like illness  // any evidence of
 pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, basal predominant, consistent
 with fibrosis/chronic lung disease, possibly slightly increased as compared to
 the prior study.  Slight increased since the prior study may be due to
 overlying minimal edema or acute exacerbation on chronic disease.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar predominant increased interstitial markings bilaterally, this patient
 with chronic interstitial lung disease, appears slightly increased in the
 upper to mid lung zones which may be due to superimposed mild interstitial
 edema or acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease.  No lobar consolidation.
