                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT from ___ as well as chest x-ray
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Appearance of the right lung is unchanged
 with surgical chain sutures adjacent to the hilum underlying fibrotic changes
 in overall right hemithorax volume loss suggestive of prior lobectomy. 
 Although the left lung is partially obscured due to overlying oxygenation mask
 and cardiac leads, there are multifocal regions of consolidation throughout
 the lung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications again seen at the aortic arch.  Bilateral shoulder
 arthroplasties are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal regions of consolidation in the left lung was concerning for
 infection.  Continued follow up will be necessary to document resolution given
 patient's history of multiple malignancies.
