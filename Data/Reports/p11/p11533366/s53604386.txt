                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, AF on coumadin, RA, COPD presenting
 worsening edema and DOE with crackles on exam.  // Please evaluate for
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation of this radiograph is somewhat limited due to overlying soft
 tissues. Lung volumes are low, with unchanged moderate right hemidiaphragm
 elevation. There is possible mild cardiomegaly, unchanged. There are no
 definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. There have been bilateral
 shoulder hemiarthroplasties.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Essentially clear lungs. Low lung volumes and overlying soft tissue make it
 difficult to evaluate for mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Unchanged extent of possible mild cardiomegaly.
