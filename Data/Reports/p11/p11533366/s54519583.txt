                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Again there is chronic cardiomegaly with patchy areas of
 opacification in the left lung.  This could reflect some improvement in
 consolidation in the mid and lower zones, though increased opacification in
 the left upper region.
 
 Again there is striking elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with tenting.
 
 Again, CT might be helpful to better assess the appearance of the underlying
 lung.
