                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette including cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 Calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch. Low lung volumes persist.
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus could be due to atelectasis or a
 small effusion. Linear opacity at the left base is most compatible with
 atelectasis. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis.
