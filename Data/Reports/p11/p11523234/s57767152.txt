                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation  // evaluate for ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.9 cm from the carina.  Lung
 volumes are low compared to the prior study.  This accentuates the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette size which appears borderline enlarged.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Hazy
 and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen. 
 Clips are seen within the neck bilaterally compatible with recent
 thyroidectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
