 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 The feeding tube has been advanced slightly within the stomach.  Other devices
 remain unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Diffuse bilateral ground-glass and reticular opacities have slightly improved
 within the left mid and lower lung region.  The right lung is difficult to
 compare to the prior study due to incomplete imaging of the right lung. 
 Healing lower left lateral rib fractures are noted with no visible
 pneumothorax.
