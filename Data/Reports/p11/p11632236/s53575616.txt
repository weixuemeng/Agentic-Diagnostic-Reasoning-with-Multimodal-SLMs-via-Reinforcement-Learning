 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A known moderate right pleural
 effusion appears increased from most recent prior and has a convex margin
 suggesting loculation.  Underlying atelectasis appears stable.  The remainder
 of the lungs are clear.  There is possible trace left pleural effusion as
 well.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right pleural effusion with possible new
 loculation
