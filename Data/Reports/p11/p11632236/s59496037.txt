                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of liver disease, now with respiratory distress requiring
 intubation, here to evaluate ET tube and OG tube positions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately three hours earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an ET tube terminating at the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 8 cm above the carina, which should be advanced
 for more stable seating.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out
 of view on this image.  There is diffuse reticular nodular opacification of
 the left lung with slightly improved aeration of the lower lung from the most
 recent prior study.  The right upper lung is well aerated.  There is
 heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base and obscuration of the
 right hemidiaphragm consistent with consolidation, unchanged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged.  A dual chamber right
 supraclavicular approach dialysis catheter is unchanged, ending at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube ending 8 cm above the carina, should be advanced for stable
 seating.
 
 2.  Extensive bilateral consolidations with slightly improved aeration of the
 left mid to lower lung from the most recent prior study and ___.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ medicine
 via telephone at 10:15 a.m. on ___.
