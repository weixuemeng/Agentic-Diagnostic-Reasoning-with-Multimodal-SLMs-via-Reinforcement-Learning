                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Postop day 3, status post decortication.  Removed all chest tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest show absence of the two
 right-sided chest tubes that were present on yesterday's exam.  Minimal fluid
 with some loculated air remains over the right lower lung laterally, probably
 in the pleural space.  There is some consolidation along the course of the
 upper of the two removed tubes.  The left lung remains clear.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema at the base of the right neck has not increased in extent. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.
