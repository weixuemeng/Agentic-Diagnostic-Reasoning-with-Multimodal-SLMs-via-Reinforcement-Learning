                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube appears in position with the tip in the mid
 trachea.  An enteric tube traverses the stomach.  Right-sided central venous
 catheter appears stable with the tip at the proximal right atrium.
 
 Again noted is a moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Consolidation is again noted in the right lower lobe and may reflect site of
 pulmonary infection.  Additionally, left lung reticular opacities with septal
 thickening, better delineated on dedicated CT, are slightly improved and may
 represent edema with possible coexisting infection or hemorrhage. The right
 upper lung continues to be spared. Cardiac and medistinal contours are stable.
 There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe infectious process as noted on CT.  Slight
 improvement in reticular opacities throughout the entire left lung, which may
 represent edema with overlying infectious process as delineated on dedicated
 CT from the same day. Moderate left pleural effusion.
