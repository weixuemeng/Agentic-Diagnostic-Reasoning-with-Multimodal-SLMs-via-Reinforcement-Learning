                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and shortness of breath.  Assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Interstitial
 opacities are again seen in the lungs in a similar overall pattern suggesting
 chronic fibrosis.  A component of superimposed edema cannot be excluded. 
 Small bilateral effusions are present.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.  A chronic deformity of the right seventh
 rib is again noted.
