                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and emesis.  Evaluate for worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 3:42.  Chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The enodtracheal tube is slightly high, 5.2 cm from the carina,
 with the chin in the flexed position.  An enteric tube is present with the tip
 in the stomach.  Two central venous catheters are in unchanged position.
 
 Since prior exam, there is increased opacity at the right base.  The extensive
 parenchymal opacities on the left are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity at the right base, likely aspiration given the clinical
 history.  
 2.  Otherwise no significant change in the extensive parenchymal opacities,
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
 3.  Slightly high endotracheal tube.  Could advance 1.5 cm downward for a more
 secure position.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:15 PM on ___ via telephone by
 Dr. ___ ___ minutes after the findings were discovered.
