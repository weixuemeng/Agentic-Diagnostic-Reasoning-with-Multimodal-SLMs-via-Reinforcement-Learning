                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver disease, poor nutrition, Dobbhoff placement.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, the NG tube has been removed and a Dobbhoff tube has
 been placed.  The radiopaque tip overlies the expected site of the gastric
 fundus/body.  Tubing also overlies the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, ?
 stent.  A right-sided central line tip overlies the distal SVC/RA junction.
 
 
 As before, there is hyperinflation suggestive of background COPD and
 moderately severe cardiomegaly.  There are diffuse confluent and interstitial
 opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the left mid zone and surrounding
 that and at the right base. There is also  increased retrocardiac density,
 probably with an elevated diaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  ? small left effusion.  
 
 I suspect the presence of a rib fracture at the left chest base.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval placement of Dobbhoff tube, with radiopaque tip overlying the
 stomach.  This does not pass beyond the pylorus.
 
 2) Bilateral pulmonary opacities, left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation and small left effusion.  The lower right chest wall and right
 costophrenic angle are excluded from the film.
 
 3) Cardiomegaly, similar to prior.
 
 4) Possible rib fracture lower left chest.  Clinical correlation requested.
