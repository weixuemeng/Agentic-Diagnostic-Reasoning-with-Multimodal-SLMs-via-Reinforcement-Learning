                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the opacification along the right lower chest wall with some
 hazy extension medially, consistent with substantial right pleural effusion,
 much of which is apparently loculated.
 
 Left lung is clear.
