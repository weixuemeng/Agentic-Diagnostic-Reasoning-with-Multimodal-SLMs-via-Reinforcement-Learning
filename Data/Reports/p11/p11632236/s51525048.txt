                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:55 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with end-stage liver disease.  Check NG tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach.  ET tube, left internal jugular and
 right supraclavicular central venous line are in standard placements
 respectively.  Some of the improvement in opacification in the left hemithorax
 is due to dependent repositioning of left pleural effusion, but it is possible
 that the interstitial infiltrative abnormality is improving because it appears
 slightly better in the right lower lobe as well.  No pneumothorax.
