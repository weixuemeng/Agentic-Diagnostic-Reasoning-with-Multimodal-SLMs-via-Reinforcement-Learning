                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, here to evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube has been advanced, the tip now terminating
 2.5-cm above the carina, which may be related to position of the head and
 neck.  An enteric tube has been pulled back from ___, with the tip now
 terminating at the diaphragm in the left upper quadrant, likely in the
 proximal stomach.  A left internal jugular central venous catheter and right
 supraclavicular approach dual-chamber dialysis catheter are unchanged in
 position.  The appearance of the chest is otherwise similar to the prior exam
 with diffuse infiltrative parenchymal opacities throughout the left lung and
 consolidated right lower lung.  Small pleural effusions are likely present. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip 2.5 cm above the carina, which may be related to position of
 the head and neck.
 2.  Enteric tube retracted with the tip in the proximal stomach.
 3.  Otherwise, similar appearance of the chest.
