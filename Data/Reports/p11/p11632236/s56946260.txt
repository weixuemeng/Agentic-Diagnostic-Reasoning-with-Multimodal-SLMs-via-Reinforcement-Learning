                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated are bilateral, multifocal patchy airspace opacities compatible
 with a diffuse infectious process. As compared to the prior examination, the
 right lung is slightly better aerated, whereas the left lung is essentially
 unchanged in appearance.  There is no evidence of significant pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. A right central venous line, NGT, and ETT are again seen
 in their expect locations. Redemonstrated are several subacute left rib
 fractures, better evaluated on the prior rib series.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Essentially unchanged multifocal airspace opacities compatible with an
 infectious process. Minimal interval improved aeration of the right lung.
