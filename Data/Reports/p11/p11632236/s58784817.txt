                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 6.3
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip
 out of field of view.  A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged with the
 tip in the mid-to-upper SVC.
 
 Extensive parenchymal opacities throughout the entire left lung and in the
 right middle and lower lung zones are similar to the prior exam.  There is no
 new opacity.  There are likely tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, no significant change from the prior exam, including the
 extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities.
