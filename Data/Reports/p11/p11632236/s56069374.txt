                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of liver transplant, failure to thrive.  Please assess
 for NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive bilateral, however, predominantly left-sided interstitial
 lung opacities are overall slightly worse compared to the prior exam.  There
 is also increased opacification at the right lung base.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are persistent.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. 
 There is a right-sided central venous dialysis line which terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  An NG tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in
 the body of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in moderate bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increase in opacification at the right lung base may be concerning for
 superimposed infection.
 
 3.  Nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of
 the stomach.
 
 ___ were d/w Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 4p on the day of the
 exam.
