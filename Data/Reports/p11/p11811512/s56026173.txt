                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 9:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with macroprolactinoma.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary process.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 20:42.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 9:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube.  Lungs are
 low in volume but without evidence of focal air space consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Some slight prominence of
 the perihilar vasculature most likely reflects crowding due to low lung
 volumes although a fluid-replete state should also be considered.  Overall
 cardiac mediastinal contours are stable.
