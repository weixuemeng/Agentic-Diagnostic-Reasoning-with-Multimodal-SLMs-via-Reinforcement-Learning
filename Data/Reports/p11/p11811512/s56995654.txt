                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elevated D-dimer from outside clinic with diagnosis of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___ and abdominal
 CT from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pulmonary edema.  A new left pleural effusion is
 present, with slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, all new since the
 ___ CT examination.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen, worse at the
 left base.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left pleural effusion and elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, with bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the left.  Given chronic
 pain over several days and worsening findings at the left base, a PE cannot be
 excluded.  Recommend chest CT examination for further evaluation.
