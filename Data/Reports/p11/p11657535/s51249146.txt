 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:50 PM
  Clinical concern for tamponade per ___. WET READ: ___al
  repositioning of the swan-ganz catheter. Interval extubation and removal of
  the esophageal catheter. Mediastinal contours are stable compared to one day
  prior, but CT is more sensitive fur acute mediastinal vascular pathology and
  echocardiography is more sensitive for pericardial fluid/tamponade. Low lung
  volumes with blunting of the left costophrenic angle, likely secondary to
  small pleural effusion, which is slightly increased compared to prior.
  Persistent cardiomegaly. Mediastinal drains and chest tubes still seen.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 5:48 p.m. on ___ at time of
  initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:12 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after AVR.  Evaluate for widened mediastinum and
 possible tamponade.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, ET tube has been removed and lung volumes are consequently
 slightly smaller, exaggerating the extent of moderate pre-operative
 cardiomegaly, really unchanged.  There is little residual pulmonary edema,
 though bibasilar atelectasis left more severe than right is persistent.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Swan-Ganz catheter traversing a right
 jugular sheath ends in the right pulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax.
