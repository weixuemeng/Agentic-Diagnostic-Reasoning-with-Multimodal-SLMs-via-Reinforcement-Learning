                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chills.  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax in the right hemi thorax; the medial aspect of the left hemi
 thorax is partially obscured by the cardiac silhouette. Right shoulder
 hardware, small bore drainage catheter in the right upper quadrant. Aorta is
 heavily calcified and the arch, but not dilated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Grossly normal radiographic examination of the chest.  Conventional lateral
 views would better assess the left lower chest, to determine if there is
 either atelectasis or posteriorly layering pleural effusion lobe.
