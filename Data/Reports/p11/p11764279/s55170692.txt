  1. Rounded opacity within lower lungs is worrisome for focal pneumonia.
  Recommend followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks once clinically stable to
  assess for resolution.
  2. Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and linear
  atelectasis in right mid lung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph1 ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated. Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates
 hypoinflated lungs with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and crowding of
 vasculature. Linear platelike atelectasis within the right mid lung is noted.
 Rounded opacity within the lower lungs is present. Heterogeneous opacity
 within the right lower lobe is most consistent with atelectasis.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila
 are otherwise unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is notable
 for a partially visualized catheter within the left upper quadrant
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Rounded opacity within lower lungs is worrisome for focal pneumonia.
 Recommend followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks once clinically stable to
 assess for resolution.
 2. Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and linear
 atelectasis in right mid lung.
