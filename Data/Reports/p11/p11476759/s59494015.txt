                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchiectasis and pulmonary nodules.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is apical pleural thickening primarily
 on the left with fibrotic changes in the right upper zone, suggestive of prior
 fibrotic response to old tuberculous disease.  Prominence of coarse
 interstitial markings at the bases is consistent with the previous CT
 demonstration of bronchiectasis.  No definite acute focal pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.
