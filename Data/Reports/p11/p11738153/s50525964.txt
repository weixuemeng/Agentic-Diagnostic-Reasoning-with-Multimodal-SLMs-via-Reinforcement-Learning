 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs and CT chest images are not available for
 review at the time of this dictation.  Comparison is made to the report on

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Dense
 circular opacities projecting over the left mediastinum likely represent
 calcified lymph nodes, which were reportedly present based on the reports for
 prior imaging studies.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Probable calcified mediastinal nodes.  Correlation with prior chest CT
 would be helpful when available.
