                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Minimal opacity is noted in the left
 lower lobe.  Remainder of lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Remote right
 sixth rib fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal opacity in left lower lobe likely reflecting atelectasis
 though early infection cannot be completely excluded.
