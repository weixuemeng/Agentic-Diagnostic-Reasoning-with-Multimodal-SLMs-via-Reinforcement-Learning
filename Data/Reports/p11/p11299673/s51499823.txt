                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and history of
 pulmonary embolism.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated and clear bilaterally.  The right lung
 fields have a higher uniform attenuation with a thickened pleura and smaller
 volume than the left most consistent with previous pleurodesis.  The left lung
 fields are unremarkable.  There is an ICD device seen in position with leads
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 There are very mild multilevel degenerative changes of the thorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of infection or malignancy.  Increased attenuation in
 the right hemithorax most consistent with previous pleurodesis.
