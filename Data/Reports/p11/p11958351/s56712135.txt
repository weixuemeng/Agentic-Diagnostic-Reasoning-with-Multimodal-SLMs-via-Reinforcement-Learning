                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Seen on the frontal view only is equivocal
 increased opacity in the left mid lung, possibly a subtle lingular pneumonia
 or atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Faint left mid lung opacity for which one could question subtle
 lingular pneumonia or possibly atelectasis.
