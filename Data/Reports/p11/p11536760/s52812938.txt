                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  While a prominent right cardiophrenic fat pad was seen on the prior
 study, there is increased opacity at the medial right base which may be due to
 an underlying consolidation in addition to the prominent fat pad.  Prominent
 left cardiophrenic fat pad is also again seen.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is again right greater than left biapical pleural
 thickening.  Scarring at the right upper lobe.  There is also evidence of a
 hiatal hernia, with small air-fluid level seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Increased right middle lobe opacity which may represent infection in
 addition to prominent cardiophrenic fat.
 2.  Hiatal hernia.
