                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and sob  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are chronically low likely due in part to severe thoracic
 kyphosis.  The air spaces appear clear without evidence of pneumonia. The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pleural effusion likely on the left obscures the posterior
 costophrenic sulcus.  As before the thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Compression
 deformities of multiple vertebral bodies are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pleural effusion, likely on the left.  Otherwise no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
