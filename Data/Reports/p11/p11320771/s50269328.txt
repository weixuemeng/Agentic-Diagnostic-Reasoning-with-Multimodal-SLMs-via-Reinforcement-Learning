                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which accentuate bronchovascular markings.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Evaluation of the right hilum is limited
 due to patient's positioning, however, it is grossly unchanged in appearance
 since priors.  The heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, accentuating bronchovascular markings.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
