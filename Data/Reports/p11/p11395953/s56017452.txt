                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increasing secretions.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in adequate position at 4 cm above the
 carina.  The right subclavian line has been pulled back slightly but it still
 crosses the midline and its distal end is in the left mediastinum.  The distal
 end is also pointing downward.  As mentioned in the last report this is an
 unusual orientation for a venous catheter in a patient who does not have a
 persistent left superior vena cava.  The exact location of the catheter cannot
 be assessed with the exam.  The nasogastric tube is well positioned. 
 Worsening of interstitial and alveolar opacities bilaterally, more prominent
 in the perihilar region, that is mostly compatible with severe pulmonary
 edema.  A superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Does the patient have a
 limb fracture?  If so, a pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.  Tere is no
 visible pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Worsening of diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities that are mostly
 compatible with severe pulmonary edema.  A superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
 2.  The right subclavian line has been slightly pulled back but it is still
 crossing the midline and its distal end is still pointing downwards in the
 left mediastinum.  With this unusual orientation, as said in the previous
 report, the exact location of the catheter cannot be assessed in this exam.
