                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with MVC, severe lung disease, evaluation for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in adequate position at 5.4 cm above the
 carina.  The left subclavian line ends in the brachiocephalic vein and is
 unchanged.  The severe bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities are better today. 
 There is no visible pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:  The severe diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities are better today.
 The evolution and radiologic appearance is more compatible with ARDS. 
 Superimposed infection or edema cannot be excluded.
