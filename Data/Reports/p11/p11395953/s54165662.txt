                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY AP
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in good position at 5.1 cm of the carina.
 However, the right subclavian line has been repositioned since the last exam. 
 It is crossing the midline and its distal end is pointing downward on the
 left, which is unusual in a patient who does not have a left persistent
 superior vena cava.  The exact location of the line cannot be assessed with
 this exam.  It could be in any structure, and it does not follow the course of
 the normal venous system.  The distal end of the TNG is not included in this
 exam, but probably in a good position.  Amelioration of the bilateral
 opacities compatible with mild edema.  Deterioration of retrocardiac opacity
 compatible with atelectasis.  Slight deterioration of the mild pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 
 The right subclavian line has been repositioned.  It is pointing downward on
 the left side of the mediastinum and does not follow the course of the normal
 venous system.  It could be anywhere, even out of the venous system or in an
 artery.
