                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Suspected ARDS, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung parenchyma has
 increased in transparency, notably in the left perihilar areas.  Although this
 might be the effect of increased ventilatory pressure, it might also indicate
 improved ventilation.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is no pneumothorax.  Unchanged borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.
