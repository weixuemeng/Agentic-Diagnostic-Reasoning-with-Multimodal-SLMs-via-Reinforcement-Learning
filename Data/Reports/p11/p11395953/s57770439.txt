                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory insufficiency.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube is in adequate position, at 4.4 cm above the carina. 
 There is a left-sided subclavian line that ends in the distal brachiocephalic
 vein.  The lung volumes are slightly increased today, but there is no change
 in the widespread bilateral airspace consolidation.  There is no significant
 pleural effusion.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are within normal limits.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no significant change since the previous exam.  The lines and tubes
 are in adequate position.  There are stable diffuse airspace consolidations
 bilaterally.
