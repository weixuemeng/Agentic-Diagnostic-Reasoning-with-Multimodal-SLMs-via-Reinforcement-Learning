                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are low with
 chronic interstitial opacity likely reflective of chronic interstitial lung
 disease with evidence of mild interval progression.  Correlation with
 high-resolution chest CT may be helpful to further assess.  The possibility of
 a superimposed atypical pneumonia is impossible to exclude given the
 underlying interstitial opacities.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The heart and mediastinal contour appear overall stable.  The bony structures
 are intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progression of interstitial opacities compatible with chronic fibrosis. 
 Consider high-resolution chest CT to further assess.  Please note, due to the
 presence of interstitial opacity the possibility of an atypical superimposed
 pneumonia is impossible to exclude.
