                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with motor vehicle collision, on Coumadin, right
 chest wall tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. The cardiac silhouette size remains unchanged and
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. No pulmonary edema is
 overtly demonstrated. Diffuse interstitial abnormality is compatible with
 known chronic interstitial lung disease which is more pronounced in the lung
 bases.  Minimal patchy opacity within the left lung base may reflect
 superimposed atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 No displaced fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change in the appearance of chronic fibrosing
 interstitial lung disease. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect
 superimposed atelectasis.
