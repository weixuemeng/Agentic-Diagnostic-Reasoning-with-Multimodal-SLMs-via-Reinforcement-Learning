                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF exacerbation and ILD  // interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior chest radiograph there has been slight improvement in
 the degree of aeration of the bilateral lungs, likely reflecting resolving
 pulmonary edema.  There are reticular opacities with cystic change seen
 peripherally bilaterally consistent with the patient's known interstitial lung
 disease.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior
 study.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the aeration of the bilateral lungs likely reflecting
 improving pulmonary edema.  There are background changes of interstitial lung
 disease.
