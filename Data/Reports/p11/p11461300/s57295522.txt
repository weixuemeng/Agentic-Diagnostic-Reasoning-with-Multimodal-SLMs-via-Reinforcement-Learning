                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with IPF and CHF with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are again
 noted.  Increased interstitial markings seen more extensive at the bases, is
 again noted and is compatible with patient's known IPF.  Overall, the
 appearance is not significantly changed.  There is no definite new
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes compatible with patient's known IPF, without
 definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process, noting that subtle change
 would be difficult to discern.
