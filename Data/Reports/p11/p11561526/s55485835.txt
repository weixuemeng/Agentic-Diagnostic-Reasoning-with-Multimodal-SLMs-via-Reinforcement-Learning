                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  Mild curvature of the thoracic spine is again
 demonstrated.  No acute spine abnormalities are detected on this chest
 radiograph examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pulmonary cause for back pain detected.  Although no gross
 spinal abnormalities are detected, this exam was not specifically tailored to
 evaluate the spine and dedicated spine imaging may be considered if warranted
 clinically.
