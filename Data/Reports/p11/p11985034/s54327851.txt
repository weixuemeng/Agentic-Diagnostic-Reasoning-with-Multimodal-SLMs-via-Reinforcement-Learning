 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:21 PM
  Increased retrocardiac opacity as well as right perihilar opacity compared to
  prior exams which may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
  situation versus fluid tracing in the fissures and atelectasis.
  
  Otherwise, stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and bilateral
  right greater than left pleural effusions with atelectasis and low lung
  volumes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph (AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman presenting with worsening dyspnea; Evaluate for
 pneumonia, effusion, edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral low lung volumes persist. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 compressive atelectasis, greater on the left compared to the right, is overall
 unchanged. The heart appears enlarged, overall unchanged from the prior exam.
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion also overall appears unchanged.
 Retrocardiac opacity persists and could represent atelectasis or focal
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. There appears to be
 slightly increased opacification in the region of the right perihilar region,
 which could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting or fluid
 tracking in the fissures. No pneumothorax. A left central venous catheter is
 again seen and appears to terminate in the right atrium, similar to the prior
 exam. Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Overall stable features consistent with heart failure - stable
 cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and bilateral pleural effusions
 with atelectasis and low lung volumes.
 
 2.  Increased retrocardiac opacity as well as right perihilar opacity compared
 to prior exams which may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 situation versus fluid tracking in the fissures and atelectasis.
