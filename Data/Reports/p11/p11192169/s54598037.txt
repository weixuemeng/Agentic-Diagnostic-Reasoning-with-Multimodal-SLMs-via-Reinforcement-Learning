                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, known lung mets
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low which
 limits assessment.  There are scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules which may
 be slightly progressed from the prior exam.  There is also hilar congestion
 and at least mild pulmonary edema.  Small pleural effusions are likely present
 though the lateral view is limited due to obliquity.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  The imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary congestion and mild edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastatic disease.
