                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever, right lower lobe crackles, 6 days postop axillary
 tissue dissection; please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  Faint opacification with air
 bronchograms projecting over the right lower lobe with increased opacity also
 seen on the spine on the lateral view raises concern for early pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asymmetrically increased right lower lobe opacification
 concerning for pneumonia.
