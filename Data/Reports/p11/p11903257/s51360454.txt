                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right cardiac border is not well seen but it seems clear that
 the heart is at least mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is partly calcified. 
 The right lower hemithorax is opacified with balance mass effect and a
 substantial pleural effusion as well as parenchymal opacification.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion on the left.  Kyphotic
 curvature is exaggerated including mild wedging of three mid thoracic
 vertebral bodies which appears chronic.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the lower right hemithorax suggesting a pleural
 effusion, at least moderate in size, with coinciding atelectasis or possibly
 pneumonia involving the right middle and basilar portions of the lower lobe.
