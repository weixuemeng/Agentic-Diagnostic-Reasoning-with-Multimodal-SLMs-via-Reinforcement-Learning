                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assaulted with punches to both ribs and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ CT chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  Focal area of the linear scarring within the right apex is
 unchanged.  Remainder of the lungs are clear.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 compatible with underlying COPD.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
 present.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No displaced fractures are seen.  If
 there is continued clinical concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib
 series can be obtained.
