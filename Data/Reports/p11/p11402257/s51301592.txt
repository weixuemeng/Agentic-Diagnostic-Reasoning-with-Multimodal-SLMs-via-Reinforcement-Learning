                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with HA and CP  // eval for cause of CP
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated. No
 focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. There is a vague nodular opacity
 which projects over the right seventh posterior rib, possibly representing
 confluence of shadows though difficult to exclude a true pulmonary nodule.
 Bony structures appear intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs. Possible nodule in the right mid lung. Nonemergent CT may
 be performed to further assess.
