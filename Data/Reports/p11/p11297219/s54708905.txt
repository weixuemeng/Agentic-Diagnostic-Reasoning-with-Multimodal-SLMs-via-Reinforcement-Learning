                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly. When compared to
 prior radiograph dated ___, lung volumes are improved.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt in pulmonary edema. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A left pectorally placed defibrillator
 device is identified, its leads in unchanged position.  The defibrillator lead
 is seen projecting over the right ventricle and a pacer lead along the
 diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle. Hilar contours are stable when
 compared to prior examinations.  Osseous structures demonstrates degenerative
 changes within bilateral acromioclavicular joints as well as within the
 visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Improved lung volumes relative to prior study.
