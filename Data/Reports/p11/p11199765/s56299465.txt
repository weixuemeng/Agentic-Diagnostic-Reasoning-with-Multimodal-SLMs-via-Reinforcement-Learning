 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:40 AM
  IMPRESSION: No radiographic findings to explain chest pain.  Suggest 6 weeks
  followup chest radiographs for right apical lesion to exclude reactivation
  tuberculosis or early lung cancer, unless prior radiographs can be obtained
  that demonstrate it is inert.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, prior MI.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Small stellate, subpleural opacity in the
 apex of the right lung (level of first anterior interspace) at the end of
 linear scarring or atelectasis is likely a tuberculous scar, but would need
 documentation of ___ years' stability before it can be considered inert.
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: No radiographic findings to explain chest pain.  Suggest 6 week
 followup chest radiographs for right apical lesion to exclude reactivation
 tuberculosis or early lung cancer, unless prior radiographs can be obtained
 that demonstrate it is inert.
 
 Dr ___ ___ findings with ___ resident by telephone ___AM.
