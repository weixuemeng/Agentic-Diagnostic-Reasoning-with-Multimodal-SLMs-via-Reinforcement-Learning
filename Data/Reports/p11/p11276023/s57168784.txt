                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right chest port with the
 tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction/upper right atrium.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs fairly well-aerated.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Minimally
 increased opacity at the left lung base likely represents atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
