  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding, allowing for this there is
  likely mild to moderate pulmonary edema without focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain and cough, evaluate pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Increased reticulonodular
 interstitial opacities bilaterally likely represent mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Retrocardiac opacification is similar to multiple prior studies and
 likely represents a combination of atelectasis and volume overload.  There is
 no pleural effusion, consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  6 intact sternotomy
 wires unchanged.  The osseous structures and upper abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding, allowing for this there is
 likely mild to moderate pulmonary edema without focal consolidation.
