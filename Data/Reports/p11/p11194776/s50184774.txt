                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There may be
 minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 The lateral view is underpenetrated, likely due to patient body habitus. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
