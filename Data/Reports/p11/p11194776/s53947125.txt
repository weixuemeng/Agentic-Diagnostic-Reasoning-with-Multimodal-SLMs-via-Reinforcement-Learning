                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, presenting with abdominal
 pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Widespread hazy and interstitial opacities
 are most suggestive of pulmonary edema including indistinct upper zone
 re-distribution of pulmonary vasculature.  Each hilum appears prominent,
 particularly the right, including a somewhat rounded appearance.  This is
 probably due to edema, but short-term followup radiographs are recommended in
 order to exclude a persistent new right hilar contour abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs are recommended in order to exclude new contour abnormality in the
 right hilum, however.
