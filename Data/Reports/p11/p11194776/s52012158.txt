                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild bibasilar opacities are noted and likely
 representative of atelectasis, right greater than left.  Otherwise, the lungs
 are without a focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature without overt edema.  Cardiac
 silhouette appears prominent but stable.  Mild degenerative changes visualized
 throughout the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are most likely
 representative of atelectasis.  However, pneumonia must be excluded in the
 proper clinical setting.
