                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and hypoxia.  On dialysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  The lung volumes are low.  There is similar cardiomegaly.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Fissures are
 thickened.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  Perihilar fullness and,
 although somewhat heterogeneous, widespread opacification with hazy pulmonary
 vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary edema.  As seen previously, medial
 right basilar opacity is more confluent than elsewhere so coinciding
 infectious process is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggest moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Possible recurrent opacity at the right lung base; developing pneumonia is
 not excluded.
