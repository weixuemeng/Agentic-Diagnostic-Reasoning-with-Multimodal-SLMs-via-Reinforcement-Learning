                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via a left dialysis catheter
 with fever, bacteremia, and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously noted right internal jugular approach central line
 has been removed.  A large bore dual-lumen dialysis catheter from a left
 internal jugular approach is in stable course and position with the distal tip
 projecting over the junction of the superior vena cava and a brachiocephalic
 vein.  Lung volumes remain diminished.  There has been significant improvement
 in the previously noted fluid balance with near-resolution of the pulmonary
 edema.  Mild cephalized flow and interstitial prominence persists.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The osseous structures again reveal mild degenerative changes throughout the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right internal jugular approach central line.
 Stable left internal jugular approach dialysis catheter.  Near-complete
 resolution of previously noted interstitial edema now only mild residual
 remaining.  No infiltrate.
