 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF and CAD with chest pain, assess pneumonia.

 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.  The previously noted right IJ central
 venous catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no
 focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  A subtle reticulonodular
 pattern could suggest mild interstitial edema.  The heart size is top normal. 
 The mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited with probable mild pulmonary edema.
