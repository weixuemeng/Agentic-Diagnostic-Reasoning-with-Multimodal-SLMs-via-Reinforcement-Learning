                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy and CABG clips are re- demonstrated.  Lung volumes remain
 low.  Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable and unchanged.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy airspace opacities the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, however
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or iron
 pneumothorax.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.
