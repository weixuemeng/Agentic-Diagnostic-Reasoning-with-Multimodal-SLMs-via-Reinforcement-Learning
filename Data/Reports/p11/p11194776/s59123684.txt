                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes remain
 slightly low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated without pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild
 multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.
