                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms, compatible with underlying COPD.  The heart size
 is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis is noted within the lingula.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  A 4-mm calcified nodule in the
 right upper lung field is likely a granuloma.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of underlying COPD.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
