                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion with night sweats and increased wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.  This discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
 
 There is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
