                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is now nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax with some
 aeration in the left upper lobe.  There was leftward mediastinal shift. No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward mediastinal
 shift suggesting atelectasis perhaps secondary to mucous plugging. The
 subsequent radiograph demonstrates resolution of these findings following
 bronchoscopy.
