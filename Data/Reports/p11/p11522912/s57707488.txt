                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 353
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube, NG tube, left subclavian line are similar to the prior study. The top
 of an IVC filter is noted.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Again seen is left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably with a small effusion. This
 appears slightly worse than on ___. However, opacity about the left
 hilum slightly improved. Patchy opacity at the right base is similar to the
 prior film. A small right effusion is likely present and could be slightly
 increased. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular blurring,
 consistent with mild CHF,  slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild CHF, slightly worse compared with ___.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion,
 probably slightly worse. The differential includes a pneumonic infiltrate.
 3. Equivocal slight increase in small right pleural effusion. Right base
 atelectasis is similar to prior.
