 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, evaluation for pneumonia and
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement of the
 pre-existing right pleural effusion.  On the left, the presence of a minimal
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The lung volumes remain low, with
 atelectatic changes at the right lung bases in the retrocardiac lung areas. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged monitoring and support devices, unchanged
 abdominal drains and post-surgical clips.
