                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for the presence of pleural effusion in an incarcerated
 patient with graft failure following cadaveric liver transplant, transferred
 from an outside facility after found obtunded.
 
 COMPARISON:  Series of chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates markedly low lung
 volumes with interval increase in the large left pleural effusion and left
 basilar atelectasis.  There is pleural fluid tracking within the left major
 fissure.  On the right, there is progressive elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm consistent an intraabdominal process and basilar atelectasis.  A
 heterogeneous opacity obscuring the right hemidiaphragmatic contour has been
 increasing since ___.  There is no pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal and there is no edema.  The right internal jugular
 central venous line likely terminates within the right atrium, and should be
 withdrawn at least 2-3 cm to ensure proper positioning in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enlarging large left pleural effusion and associated compressive
 atelectasis.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for developing
 pneumonia.
 3.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm exacerbated by incomplete
 inspiration, likely secondary to an intra-abdominal process such as marked
 hepatomegaly or ascites.
 4.  The right IJ central line should be withdrawn 2-3 cm to ensure placement
 in the lower SVC.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 4:17 p.m. immediately after discovery.
