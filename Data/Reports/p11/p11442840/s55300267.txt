                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post Dobbhoff placement.  These findings
 were communicated to Dr. ___ 1:30 p.m.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube with
 the tip in the proximal duodenum.  There are no gross pulmonary changes since
 previous imaging. Enlarged prominent cardiac silhouette is again seen. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right remain unchanged. 
 Retrocardiac opacification consistent with left lower lobe volume loss again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube with tip in the proximal duodenum.  Consider
 advancing tube slightly further to ensure tube remains post-pyloric.
