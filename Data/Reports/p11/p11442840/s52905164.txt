                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Today's film was obtained supine, versus
 yesterday's film which was obtained erect.
 
 Multiple lines and tubes, including ET tube, NG tube, and two IJ lines, are
 similar to the prior film. ET tube tip lies at the upper edge of the medial
 clavicular heads, approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.  There is extensive
 alveolar opacification in both lungs.  Confluent opacity at the bases suggests
 the presence of left greater than right effusions, with associated collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Abdominal drains are present in the upper abdomen
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Probable pleural effusions, with dense bilateral alveolar
 infiltrates.  The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, infectious
 infiltrates, and ARDS.  In the appropriate clinical setting, other alveolar
 opacities (e.g. hemorrhage) could give rise to this appearance.
