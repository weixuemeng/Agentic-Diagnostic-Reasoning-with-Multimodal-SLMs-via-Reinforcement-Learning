 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with an orthotopic liver transplant in ___, now
 with rejection, here for review.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and NG tube are unchanged, end in standard
 position.  Low lung volumes remain.  There is unchanged dense consolidation of
 the left lung base, with a probable left pleural effusion.  Developing opacity
 in the right lower lobe is new. The cardiac silhouette is top normal, the
 mediastinal contours are normal though remain shifted to the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left greater than right basilar opacity likely
 reflecting atelectasis with moderate left pleural effusion, which are
 worsening and pneumonia with empyema should be considered.
