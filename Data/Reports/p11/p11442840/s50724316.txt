                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated status post OLT.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The patient's chin overlies the upper chest and there is kyphotic positioning.
 Allowing for this, the bilateral IJ lines are unchanged.  The NG tube extends
 beneath the diaphragm.  The ET tube is difficult to evaluate because, as a
 result of positioning, the tracheal/carinal air column is not demonstrated.  
 
 There are diffuse alveolar opacities throughout much of both lungs, with left
 greater than right effusions.  Allowing for considerable differences in
 positioning, this is probably unchanged compared with earlier the same day
 (6:13 a.m.).  Upper abdominal drains noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited assessment of ET tube, due to positioning.  Please see comment.
 2.  Dense bilateral alveolar infiltrates and probable left-greater-than- right
 effusions are grossly unchanged.
