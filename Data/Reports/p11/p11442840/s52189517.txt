                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New feeding tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a Dobbhoff
 tube that extends at least to the fourth portion of the duodenum and possibly
 to the jejunum.  On its course, however, there is a wide loop of the tube in
 much of the thoracic esophagus.
 
 Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with effusion and atelectasis, more
 prominent on the left.  No vascular congestion, and the upper lungs are clear.
