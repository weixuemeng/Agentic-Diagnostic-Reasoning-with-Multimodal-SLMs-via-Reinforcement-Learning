 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:44 PM
  Persistent patchy opacities in the right greater than left lung, as seen on CT
  and radiographs in ___, slightly improved but not resolved. Differential
  diagnosis includes infection. Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
  with left basilar atelectasis. Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:41

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a subsequent plate-like atelectasis
 at the left lung bases.  The appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the
 right lung base is unchanged.
 
 In almost unchanged manner, lung shows predominantly alveolar widespread
 opacities with some air bronchograms, better documented on the CT examination
 from ___.  The severity and distribution of the changes has, if
 any, only minimally regressed.
 
 The morphology of the changes suggests an infectious cause.
 
 No evidence of pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
