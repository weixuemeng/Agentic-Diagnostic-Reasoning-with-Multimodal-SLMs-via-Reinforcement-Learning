                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pulmonary edema has nearly resolved in the interval and a right
 pleural effusion is no longer evident.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 persists, and is difficult to compare to the prior study due to positional
 differences but may be slightly smaller.  Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities
 persist and likely represent atelectasis.
