                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver transplant, now with elevated
 white count, question pulmonary edema, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 806.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is worsening airspace disease within the right lung as well as
 increasing airspace disease within the left lung.  These findings either
 reflect a worsening bilateral pneumonia or possibly pulmonary edema, although
 the vasculature on the previous study was entirely normal in appearance.
 Clinical correlation is advised.  There is persistent opacity at the left base
 also suggestive of an effusion with associated lower lobe atelectasis.  Lung
 volumes remain markedly diminished.  No right effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax.
