                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post liver transplant in ___, found
 obtunded, transferred from outside hospital.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:48.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 8:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line.  Lung volumes
 remain markedly low and there is persistent stable left pleural effusion with
 associated airspace opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Patchy opacities within the right lung are
 concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess given the marked low lung volumes.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
