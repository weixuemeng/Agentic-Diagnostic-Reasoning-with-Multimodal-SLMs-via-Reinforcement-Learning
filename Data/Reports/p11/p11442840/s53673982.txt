                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male requiring assessment of Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest images demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube with the
 tip apparently in the stomach, although the course of the Dobbhoff tube is not
 entirely visualized on these images.  There are no complications, including no
 pneumothorax visualized.  Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged
 from the radiograph obtained earlier in the same day.  There is some mild
 improvement in the interstitial markings in the lungs from prior imaging.
 Otherwise, exam is essentially unchanged from earlier imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube incompletely visualized but tip appears to be in
 the stomach.  Slight improvement of bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
