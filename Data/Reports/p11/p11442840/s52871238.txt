                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with liver transplant rejection for autoimmune hepatitis
 and PSC, now with increased shortness of breath, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The comparison is difficult because the previous exam was in the
 semi-erect position and now it is on erect position.  There are still
 bilateral moderate pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  The mild
 pulmonary edema has slightly decreased.  Mild cardiac enlargement is stable. 
 The patient has been extubated.  The right jugular line ends in lower SVC. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis has not changed significantly.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Slight decrease in mild pulmonary edema.  The pleural effusions are hard to
 compare because of different position, they are moderate.
