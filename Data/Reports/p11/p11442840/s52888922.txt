                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of liver transplant and recent hematemesis,
 recent intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New ET tube ends 3.1 cm above carina.  Right-sided jugular line ends in mid
 SVC.  Progression of right moderate pleural effusion and left mild-to-moderate
 pleural effusion with sign of moderate pulmonary edema.  There is a more focal
 zone in the right upper lobe that could be consistent with edema, but an
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 unchanged.  There is also a lesser elevation of the diaphragm due to massive
 splenomegaly.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Line and tubes are in adequate position.
 2.  Worsening of moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusion.
 3.  Slight new focal zone in the right upper lobe where aspiration or
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
