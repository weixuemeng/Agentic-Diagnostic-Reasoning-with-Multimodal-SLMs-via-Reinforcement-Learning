 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pleural effusion, evaluation for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusion on the
 left is not substantially changed.  There is unchanged evidence of plate-like
 atelectasis on the left, associated to low lung volumes.  The pre-existing
 right parenchymal opacities are less severe than on the previous image. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged low lung volumes.
