                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ other requirement, unable to wean to room air POD___ s/p
 afrenalectomy  // R/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ in ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings and
 enlarges the cardiac silhouette.  Given that, the heart is enlarged.  The
 course of the aorta is irregular consistent with a known large thoracic aortic
 dissection.  Calcification along the thoracic aorta is demonstrated.  Subtle
 basal opacities likely represent atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Of
 note, soft tissue density overlying the left apex is most likely related to
 overlying soft tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly low lung volumes and bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis however
 infection should be considered in the appropriate setting. Markedly widened
 mediastinum is related to a large known aortic dissection.
