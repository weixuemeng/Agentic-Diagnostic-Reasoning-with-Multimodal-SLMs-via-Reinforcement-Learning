                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior CT torso from ___ as well as a CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis performed at an outside hospital earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  SBO with NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph provided.  There has been
 placement of an NG tube which is seen in the distal esophagus.  Advancement is
 needed for more optimal positioning.  Lung volumes are quite low, limiting
 further evaluation.
