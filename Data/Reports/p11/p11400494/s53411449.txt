                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The left PICC line tip is at the level of
 low SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Minimal bibasal atelectasis
 are present.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  There is minimal amount
 of left pleural effusion.
 
 As previously suggested, the NG tube can been be potentially slightly advanced
 to secure the side port location distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
