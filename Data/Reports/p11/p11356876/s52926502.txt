                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with dypnea  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles is compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Linear bibasilar opacities are suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed
 infection is difficult to exclude.
