                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures on the right with apical pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the degree of pneumothorax on the
 right is probably quite similar.  Multiple rib fractures are again noted with
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No definite vascular congestion.  The more
 coalescent area of increased opacification at the right base is less prominent
 at this time.
