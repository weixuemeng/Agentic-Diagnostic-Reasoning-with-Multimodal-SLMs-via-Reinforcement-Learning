                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pna s/p intubation  // interval change    
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 05:29.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is improving aeration within the right lung suggesting decrease in size
 of right-sided pleural effusion. Persistent parenchymal opacities within the
 right lung are consistent with persistent pneumonia.  Interval appearance of
 retrocardiac consolidation may reflect aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis.
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax. Right internal jugular
 central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in
 position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visible on the
 study. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
