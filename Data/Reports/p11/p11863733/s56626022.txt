                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a pleural effusion, in a patient
 with influenza and MRSA pneumonia, and an empyema status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, enteric tube descending below
 the diaphragm in off the inferior edge of the image, right PICC terminating in
 the low SVC, and a right pigtail catheter overlying the right base.  Lung
 volumes are slightly lower compared to prior chest radiograph, with increased
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  A
 loculated right pleural collection is similar to the prior chest radiograph. 
 No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged chest radiograph and the size of the loculated right pleural
 collection, allowing for differences in lung volumes.
