  Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea.  Enteric tube
  terminates beyond the diaphragm.  Right upper extremity PICC line terminates
  in the low SVC.  Right-sided pigtail drain terminates over the lower right
  lung.  Opacification of the right lung base is likely secondary to a
  combination of pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion.  Compared to the
  prior studies, the right lung has been improving, particularly in the right
  upper lung.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacification which likely
  represents left lower lobe collapse.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ hx schizoaffective disorder, COPD, DJD, recent hospital stay
 ___ for back pain and foot drop attributed to peroneal nerve injury w/o
 acute intervention, presented with respiratory distress, now intubated with
 septic shock of pulmonary origin. Now with increasing tachypnea  // please
 eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The
 monitoring and support devices are constant, constant position of the right
 pigtail catheter.  Constant extent of the known right pleural effusion with
 subsequent atelectasis.  Signs of mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly with small retrocardiac atelectasis.
