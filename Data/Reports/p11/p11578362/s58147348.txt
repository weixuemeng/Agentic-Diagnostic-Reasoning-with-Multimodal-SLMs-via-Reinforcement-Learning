                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with neutropenia and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Left chest wall port is again seen with
 tip at the RA/SVC junction.  Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules are again
 seen which appear slightly more confluent particularly at the lung bases when
 compared to prior.  There is no large confluent consolidation, however
 evaluation for subtle new opacity maybe a obscured by the metastatic burden. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread metastatic disease without definite acute cardiopulmonary process
 noting that subtle region of consolidation could be obscured.
