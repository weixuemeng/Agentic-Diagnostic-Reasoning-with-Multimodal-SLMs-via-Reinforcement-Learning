                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, fever 102  // assess for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain increased.  Heart is normal in size and the aorta is
 tortuous.  A 2.9 cm opacity in the right apex with associated volume loss is
 unchanged and attributed to scarring from previous radiation therapy.  A
 patchy opacity at the left base is new.  There is no pleural effusion or acute
 skeletal abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy left basilar opacity is suspicious for early pneumonia in the
 setting of acute infectious symptoms.  Given the focal nature of the opacity,
 follow-up chest x-rays are recommended in 8 weeks after completion of therapy
 to ensure resolution and to exclude the possibility of a lung neoplasm
 mimicking an infectious process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ ___ on ___ at 11:42 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
