                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs of___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  Increased
 opacification adjacent to the right hilum may represent asymmetric edema or
 possibly early pneumonia. The heart is stably mildly enlarged. The
 endotracheal tube ends 6.1 cm from the carina. The enteric tube ends within
 the decompressed stomach, however the side port ends in the distal esophagus,
 this should be advanced 7 cm for optimal placement. A right IJ introduction
 sheath ends at the origin of the SVC. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.
 2. Enteric tube side port within the distal esophagus, should be advanced 7 cm
 for optimal placement.
 3. Right hilar prominence may be secondary to volume overload, but in the
 proper clinical setting, a focal consolidation cannot be ruled out.
