                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, stroke sxs x 3 hrs  // eval ?
 infection, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Subtle right base patchy
 opacity may be due to atelectasis, however, mild aspiration is not excluded. 
 No pleural effusion pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  The aorta is calcified.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the right lung base may be due to overlap of
 vascular structures with the posterior 10th rib, versus atelectasis, mild
 aspiration not excluded.  No pulmonary edema.
