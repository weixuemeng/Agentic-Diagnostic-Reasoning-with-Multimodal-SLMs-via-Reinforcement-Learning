 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent hypotension, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, predominating on the right, have decreased.  The symetry is in
 favor of pre-existing pulmonary edema.  Mild fluid overload is still present,
 but no overt pulmonary edema is currently seen.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left lung bases.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged right
 internal jugular vein catheter.
