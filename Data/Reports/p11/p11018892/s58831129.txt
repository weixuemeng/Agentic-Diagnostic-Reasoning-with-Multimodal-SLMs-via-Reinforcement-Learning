 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sarcoid, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes are normal.  There is no evidence of fibrosis. 
 However, a zone of micronodular opacities in the right lung is seen.  The
 opacities are predominantly micronodular in appearance, could be related to
 the clinical history of sarcoid.  In addition, there is a linear opacity that
 could represent a suture line (is there a history of lung biopsy?).
 
 No pleural effusions.  No hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
