 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  The tip of the nasogastric tube appears to extend to the
 upper portion of the stomach.  It is very difficult to determine the precise
 position of the side-port on the images presented.  Otherwise little change.
