 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:52 AM
  Moderate left pleural effusion is larger than seen on the radiographs from one
  week ago and is accompanied by probable left lower lobe collapse.  Given the
  rib fractures, this raises concern for hemothorax.  The left 6th rib fracture
  appears more displaced than on the prior study.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:57 AM
  Moderate left pleural effusion is larger than seen on the radiographs from one
  week ago. The left 6th rib fracture appears more displaced than on the prior
  study.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of multiple myeloma, presenting with
 left-sided chest pain and a history of known rib fractures.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia, atelectasis,
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are fractures of the posterior left ___ and 6th ribs, as well as
 multiple other fractures which are not well seen. The degree of displacement
 in the 6th rib fracture appears more pronounced. There is a moderate left
 pleural effusion, which has increased in size from one week ago. In addition,
 on the lateral view, the sharp demarcation between the opacity and aerated
 lung raises concern for left lower lobe collapse. Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate left pleural effusion is larger than seen on the radiographs from
 one week ago and is likely accompanied by left lower lobe collapse.  This
 raises concern for hemothorax given the rib fracture.
 2. The left 6th rib fracture appears more displaced than on the prior study.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Update in the wet read to raise concern for left lower lobe
 collapse and possible hemothorax given enlarging pleural effusion in the
 setting of rib fractures was communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ phone
 on ___ at 07:52.
