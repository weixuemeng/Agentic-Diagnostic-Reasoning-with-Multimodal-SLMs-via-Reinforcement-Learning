                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size with mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unchanged allowing for differences in technique and patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
