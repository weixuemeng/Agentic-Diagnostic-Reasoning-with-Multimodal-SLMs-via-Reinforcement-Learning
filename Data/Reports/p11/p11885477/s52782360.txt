                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with fevers, cough  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable technique exaggerates the cardiac contour and pulmonary vasculature. 
 Additionally, there are low lung volumes which further exaggerate the
 mediastinal contour.  There is mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
 congestion and likely mild interstitial edema.  No right pleural effusion. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis or a small
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and portable technique exaggerate the cardiac contour and
 pulmonary vasculature.  With this in mind there is mild cardiomegaly, vascular
 congestion and likely interstitial edema.  No large pleural effusion.
