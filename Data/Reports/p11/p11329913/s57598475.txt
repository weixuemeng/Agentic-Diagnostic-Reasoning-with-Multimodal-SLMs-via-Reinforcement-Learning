                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, generalized weakness  // Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   None similar.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with relative flattening of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms, but otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary
 edema, pneumothorax, or consolidation suspicious for pneumonia The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Partially visualized cervical
 spinal fusion hardware is noted.
 
 On the lateral view, there is a questionable ill-defined nodular density
 projecting over the anterior aspect of the T9 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Hyperinflation, compatible with emphysema.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia.
 3. Questionable small nodular opacity seen on the lateral view overlying the
 anterior T9 vertebral body, most likely due to overlapping structures. 
 Resolution of this finding with shallow oblique radiographs from the lateral
 projection should be obtained, and shown to a radiologist to confirm technical
 adequacy.
