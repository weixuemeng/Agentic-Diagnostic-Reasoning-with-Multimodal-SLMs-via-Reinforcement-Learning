                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 9:49 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after left VATS pleural biopsy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones could be
 artifact of biopsy, including atelectasis and hemorrhage, could alternatively
 reflect aspiration.  I would recommend a followup with conventional chest
 radiographs when feasible.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right lung
 clear.  Cardiomegaly mild to moderate, but no pulmonary edema or particular
 vascular engorgement is present.
