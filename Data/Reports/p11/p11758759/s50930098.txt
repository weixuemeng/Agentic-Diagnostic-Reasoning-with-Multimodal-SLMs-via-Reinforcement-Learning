 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 03:00 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left sided single lead pacer is seen with the lead terminating over the
 expected location of the right ventricle, although the tip is not completely
 imaged.  The heart is enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a
 pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There is likely a layering
 left effusion with retrocardiac opacity which could reflect partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded.  The
 remaining left lung and and right lung are clear.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
