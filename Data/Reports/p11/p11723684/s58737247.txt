                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for supine AP portable technique and low lung volumes, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits. 
 The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Irregular contours along the left posterior lateral fifth and sixth ribs
 suggest prior fractures, but probably not recent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of recent injury.  Old left-sided rib
 fractures.
