 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoventilation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumonia on the current radiograph. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No pneumothorax.
