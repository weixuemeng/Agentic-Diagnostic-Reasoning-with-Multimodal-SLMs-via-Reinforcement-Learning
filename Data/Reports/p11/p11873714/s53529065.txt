                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is prominence and indistinctness of the hila, similar to
 prior, which may be due to vascular engorgement with mild pulmonary edema.  On
 the lateral view, there is some increased opacity projecting over the spine
 and underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pneumothorax.
