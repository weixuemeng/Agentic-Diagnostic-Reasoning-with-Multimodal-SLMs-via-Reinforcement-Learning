                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Dyspnea, crackles bilaterally.  Evaluate for congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 UPRIGHT FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Hyperinflated lungs consistent with
 emphysema.  Increased interstitial markings and prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature are concerning for early heart failure.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A
 lobulation of the aortic contour corresponds to a saccular aneurysm of the
 aortic arch that is better characterized on the prior CT chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent interstitial markings, peribronchial cuffing and
 cephalization concerning for early heart failure.
