                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F MVC, rib fx  // interval assessment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged though slightly more shifted to the
 left. Increasing bibasilar opacities larger on the left side could be due to
 atelectasis but aspiration is also in the differential. There is no
 pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Rib fractures are better seen in
 prior CT
