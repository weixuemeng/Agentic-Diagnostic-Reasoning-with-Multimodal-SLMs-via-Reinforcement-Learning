                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Large
 retrocardiac air-fluid level is most consistent with a hiatal hernia.  There
 is adjacent atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is rotated slightly to the
 right.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  There is prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery, which may be due to component of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery may
 suggest a component of pulmonary hypertension.
