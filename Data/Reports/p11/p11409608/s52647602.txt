                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New NG tube for small bowel obstruction.  Evaluate NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside CT of the abdomen ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  New NG tube has its tip in the stomach but side-port near the GE
 junction.  The lungs show atelectasis at both bases as seen on recent CT, but
 are otherwise clear.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 right pleural thickening is nonspecific.  3.5 x 2.1 cm rounded density at the
 left base likely corresponds to callus from rib fracture as seen on CT.  There
 are multiple bilateral healed rib fractures.  The upper abdomen shows multiple
 dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube with tip in the stomach but side-port near the GE junction. 
 Advancing the tube approximately 5 cm would place the side-port safely in the
 stomach.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels
 compatible with known small bowel obstruction.
 2.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis as seen on recent CT without evidence of
 pneumonia.
