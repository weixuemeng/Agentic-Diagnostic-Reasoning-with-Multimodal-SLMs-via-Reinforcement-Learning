                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new crackles both bases  // ? fluid
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None provided.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.   Heterogeneous area of opacity in the left lower
 lobe can either represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or early pneumonia. 
 There is asymmetric right greater than left pulmonary fibrosis with traction
 bronchiectasis, predominantly in the right upper lobe. Trace, if any,
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacities at the bilateral lung with tenting of
 the bilateral hemidiaphragms suggest mild atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Otherwise, mediastinal hilar contours are
 normal.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heterogeneous area of opacity in the left lower lobe can either represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or early pneumonia.  If possible, old radiographs
 should be obtained and uploaded to PACS for comparison.
 2. Asymmetric right greater than left pulmonary fibrosis with traction
 bronchiectasis, predominantly in the right upper lobe.
 3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
