                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History HLP, Achalasia status post myotomy, STEMI, GERD, question
 dyspnea, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING.  
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  There is a small left effusion and possibly a small
 right effusion.  There is increased retrocardiac density and right infrahilar
 density consistent with lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 superior mediastinum is not well demonstrated on this view due to lordotic
 positioning. There is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  The degree of retrocardiac opacity is greater and the left
 effusion is new, compared with the film dated ___ at 18:37 p.m.  
 
 Chondroid calcifications in the diaphysis of the right proximal humerus are
 noted, extending beyond the infeiror edge of this film, over a length of at
 least 4 cm. In the absence of atypical upper arm pain, this likely represents
 a benign enchondroma.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left, with possible new left effusion.  
 2.  Limited assessment of superior mediastinum due to lordotic positioning.
 3.  Probable right humeral diaphysis enchondroma.  When the patient is stable,
 recommend clinical correlation to exclude any right humeral atypical pain and
 baseline right humerus radiographs to include the entire lesion.
