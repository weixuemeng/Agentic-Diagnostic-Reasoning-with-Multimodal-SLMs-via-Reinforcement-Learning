  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Heterogenous opacities in the right
  mid-to-lower lung and right upper lung could be due to asymmetric edema,
  although could also be secondary to an infectious process.  Recommend repeat
  radiographs after diuresis (when possible, in light of GI bleed).  ___ d/w

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:37 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  MI.  Hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema is evenly distributed in the left lung.  On
 the right, there is greater perihilar opacification extending into the lower
 lobe which could be asymmetric edema or concurrent pneumonia.  A roughly
 spherical ___-mm wide opacity filling the apex of the right hemithorax should
 be considered a lung mass until proved otherwise.
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged.  Bulge in the left lower mediastinal contour is
 probably due to hiatus hernia, but could be a paraspinal lesion.  Findings
 discussed by telephone at the time of dictation with Dr. ___.
