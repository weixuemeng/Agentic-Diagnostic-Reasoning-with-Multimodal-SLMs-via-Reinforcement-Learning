                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dilated esophagus and possible aspiration. 
 Rule out visible aspiration.

 FINDINGS:

 is the patient's known dilated esophagus.  Opacities at the left lung base are
 either atelectasis, likely due to low lung volumes versus aspiration in the

 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with known achalasia and atelectasis versus
 aspiration in the left lower lobe.
