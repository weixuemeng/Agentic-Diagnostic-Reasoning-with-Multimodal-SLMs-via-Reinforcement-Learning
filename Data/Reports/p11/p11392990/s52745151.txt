                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:06 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cardiomyopathy, and ground-glass opacities, now
 with increased shortness of breath.  Please assess for edema, consolidation or
 other cardiopulmonary process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly progressed between ___ and ___,
 subsequently unchanged.  A combination of vascular engorgement and worsening
 interstitial abnormality suggests all the findings could be explained by
 cardiac decompensation.  Because of asymmetry in lower lobe involvement there
 could be concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia, but that diagnosis need not be
 invoked to explain the current findings.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.
 Transvenous pacer lead tip projects over the apex of the right ventricle.
