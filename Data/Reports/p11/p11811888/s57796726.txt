 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, rising white blood cell count, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Nevertheless, the lung bases are more radiolucent than on the previous
 image, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  No interval appearance of
 focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  No pleural effusions. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
