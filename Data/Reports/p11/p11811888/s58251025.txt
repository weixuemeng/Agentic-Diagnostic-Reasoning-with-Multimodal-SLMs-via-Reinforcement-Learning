                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is coiled in the proximal duodenum.  There are low lung volumes
 with increasing left lower lobe opacities, consistent with increasing
 atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large effusions.
