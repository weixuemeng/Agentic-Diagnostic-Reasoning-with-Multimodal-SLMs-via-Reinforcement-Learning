                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain with heavy IV fluid resuscitation.  Evaluate for
 overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the chest radiograph from yesterday, there is
 increased vascular congestion with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Increased hazy opacification at the right base is likely due to asymmetric
 edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous, and stable.  The cardiac size is at the upper
 limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
