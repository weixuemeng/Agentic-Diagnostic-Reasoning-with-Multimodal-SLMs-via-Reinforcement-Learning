                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Superimposed trauma board limits detailed evaluation.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  There is calcification
 of the aortic knob.  A 1.4-cm calcified round opacity overlying the left lung
 base may represent a chondral calcification, but a pulmonary nodule cannot be
 excluded.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 coronary stent is noted along the left heart border.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes along the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Calcified rounded opacity overlying the left lung base may be a chondral
 calcification.  Non-emergent PA and lateral views may be obtained for
 confirmation after patient stabilization.
