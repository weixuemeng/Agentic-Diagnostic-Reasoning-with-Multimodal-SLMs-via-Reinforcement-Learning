                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated just back from OR  // check on
 line and ET tube placement after transfer to OR      check on line and ET tube
 placement after transfer to OR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to determine, though
 appears to be about 7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends at least
 to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  Hazy
 opacification in the right hemithorax suggests substantial layering effusion
 with compressive basilar atelectasis, with less prominent changes on the left.
 Some of this appearance could well represent scatter radiation related to the
 size of the patient.
