 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Patchy
 areas of opacification at the bases again could represent aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is no longer seen, though this
 could reflect a more erect position of the patient rather than clearing of
 small effusions.
