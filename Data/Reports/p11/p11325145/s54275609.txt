                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, questionable pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an unchanged zone
 of minimally increased lung density at the medial aspect of the right lung
 base.  The change does not obliterate the right heart border.
 
 In an appropriate clinical context, subtle pneumonia must be suspected.
 
 Normal lung volumes.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
