 is present.  Mediastinal drains are in place.  Sternal wires with a
 stabilizing device are present.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is seen within the right
 atrium, but the distal tip cannot be traced further due to the overlying
 structures.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has the normal postoperative
 appearance.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis and right upper lobe
 atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.  The
 previously seen pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.
