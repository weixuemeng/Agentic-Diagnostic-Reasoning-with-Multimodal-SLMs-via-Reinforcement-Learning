                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within
 normal limits.  Previously described subpleural left lower lobe opacity seen
 on prior chest radiograph which corresponds to an area of pleural fat on CT
 appears more prominent on the current exam.  Bilateral patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect areas of infection or atelectasis.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified, and there are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill-defined patchy opacities in lung bases which may represent areas of
 infection or atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
 2.  Subpleural opacity in the left lower lobe appears more prominent on the
 current exam, and corresponds to an area of pleural fat as noted on the prior
 chest CT.
