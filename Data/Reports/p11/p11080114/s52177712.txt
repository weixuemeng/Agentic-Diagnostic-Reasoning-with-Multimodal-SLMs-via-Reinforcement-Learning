                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent intubation, here to evaluate position of endotracheal
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time due to the patient's
 critical status in the EU. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 4.6-cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is in
 place coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper
 quadrant, likely within the gastric fundus.  The inspiratory lung volumes are
 decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Atelectasis is noted in
 both lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 2.  No acute intrathoracic process.
