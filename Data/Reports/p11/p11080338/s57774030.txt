                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Failure to thrive, weakness.
 
 No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The patient is after median sternotomy, reason unclear since no evidence of
 CABG is definitely seen.  Mediastinum is shifted to the left.  Cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to assess due to obscuration of the left heart border
 by pleural effusion, partially layering and most likely partially loculated,
 moderate.  There is left lower lobe opacity, most likely reflecting
 atelectasis, unclear if secondary to the effusion or due to other reasons. 
 The right lung is essentially clear except for minimal atelectasis.  Left
 upper lung is clear as well.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema is present.  Vertebroplasty of the lower thoracic vertebral
 body, most likely T11 is noted.
 
 Comparison with prior study is recommended.  Otherwise, assessment of the
 patient with CT chest preferably with contrast for precise determination of
 left lower lobe and pleural effusion appearance might be considered.
