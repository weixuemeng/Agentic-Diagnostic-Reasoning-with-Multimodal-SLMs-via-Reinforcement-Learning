                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sudden abd distension POD___ s/p lap
 ileocecectomy  // NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for the
 purpose of nasogastric tube placement assessment, demonstrating a nasogastric
 tube terminating within the proximal stomach.  Dilated loops of bowel in the
 imaged portion of the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest
 radiograph.  Note is again made of free intraperitoneal air, likely related to
 recent surgery.
