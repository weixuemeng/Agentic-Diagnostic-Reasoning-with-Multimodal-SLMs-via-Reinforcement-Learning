                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  brain bleed, trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates approximately 4 cm below the level of the carina.  Enteric
 tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper
 quadrant in the expected location of the stomach.  There are low lung volumes.
 Subtle patchy right upper lobe opacity may be due to low lung volumes, though
 underlying contusion is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There appears to be a mildly displaced
 fracture of the lateral right third rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes appear in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Subtle hazy
 opacity over the right upper lung may be due to low lung volumes, although
 underlying pulmonary contusion is not excluded.  Lateral third right rib
 fracture.
