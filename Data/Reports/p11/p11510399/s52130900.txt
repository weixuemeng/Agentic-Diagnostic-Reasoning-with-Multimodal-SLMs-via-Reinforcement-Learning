                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___, ___:35 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Hazy opacity projecting over the left
 mid-to-lower lung may be due to a small pleural effusion with atelectasis. 
 Underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  No
 definite pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacity projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung
 may be due to pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, new since the study
 earlier today; underlying consolidation not excluded.  Cardiomegaly.  No
 definite overt pulmonary edema.
