 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 Median sternotomy wires are again seen and unchanged.  The heart size is
 within normal limits.  There are densities at the bases suggestive of
 subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases.  This may represent early
 consolidation, however.  The upper lung fields are clear.  There are no signs
 of pulmonary edema.  Bony structures are grossly intact.
