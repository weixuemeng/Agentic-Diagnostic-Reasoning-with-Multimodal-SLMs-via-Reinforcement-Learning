 A graft in the ascending thoracic aorta is new.  A new right transjugular
 right ventricular temporary pacing wire follows the expected course.  Leftward
 displacement of the trachea is more pronounced today than previously, when it
 was due to a tortuous and dilated innominate artery.  Possibility of local
 hematoma should be monitored with subsequent chest radiographs, carefully
 positioned to permit assessment of tracheal shift.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions have
 improved.  There is no pneumothorax.
