 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:30 PM
  Compared with the outside hospital CT chest of ___ and outside
  hospital chest radiograph of ___, there are new ill-defined patchy
  opacities of the entire left lung field, extending to the periphery, as well
  as in the right hilar region and right lower lung. Patient is also post TAVR. 
  No pneumothoraces or large pleural effusions identified.  In discussion with
  the ICU resident Dr. ___, ___ patient does have a history of recurrent
  pneumonia and on exam does not appear fluid overloaded.  Findings are
  concerning for developing multifocal pneumonia, given the patient's clinical
  presentation.  Further investigation into the patient's underlying immune
  status is advised.
  
  Above wet read was communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at
  19:28 on ___, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx CAD, CHF, COPD presented to OSH w/
 persistent cough and SOB, transferred with concern for NSTEMI and also with
 concern for pneumonia vs pulmonary hemorrhage.  // pneumonia vs pulmonary
 hemorrhage vs other abnormality    pneumonia vs pulmonary hemorrhage vs other
 abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly asymmetric interstitial pulmonary abnormality involving most of the
 left lung been relatively small regions at the right base and in the axillary
 region of the right upper lobe, has developed since ___.  It is hard to
 say whether heart size has increased, since cardiac apex is obscured by the
 left hemidiaphragm and the spleen.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature do
 not look particularly engorged and pleural effusion if present is small.
 
 Pulmonary edema could be the cause of this finding but the cause of the
 asymmetry needs to be explained, usually due to decubitus positioning or
 severe preexisting lung disease.  The last time the patient was in pulmonary
 edema, ___, the there was only mildly greater edema in the left lung
 than the right, so this is not a pattern dictated by pulmonary circulatory
 differences.  It could instead be due to pneumonia, particularly caused by
 virus or, given the appropriate predisposition, pneumocystis.  It could be
 pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary drug reaction, such as due to acute
 amiodarone administration.
