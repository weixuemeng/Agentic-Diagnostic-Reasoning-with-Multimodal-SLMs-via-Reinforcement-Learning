 EXAMINATION:  Portable supine chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock, intubated  // eval for
 pulm edema, position of ET tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above Carina. Left IJ CVC terminates in the upper
 SVC. Enteric tube extends to least the stomach, below image.  Post ACDF.
 Inflated IABP is in appropriate position.
 
 Heart size likely within normal for technique.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present in addition to diffuse blurring of pulmonary vasculature
 and fluffy alveolar opacities within the right more than left chest, likely
 indicating CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above Carina. Left IJ CVC terminates in the upper
 SVC. Inflated IABP is in appropriate position.
 
 Moderate to severe pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, probable CHF.
