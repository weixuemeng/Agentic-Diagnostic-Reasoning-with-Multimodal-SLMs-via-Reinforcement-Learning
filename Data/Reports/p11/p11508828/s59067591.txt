                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PA catheter, s/p repositioning  // eval
 position of PA catheter
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter has been retracted, and now terminates in the proximal
 right pulmonary artery. The ET tube tip is in the mid trachea, and the NG tube
 courses below the hemidiaphragm to terminate in the stomach. Moderate diffuse
 bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities are most likely due to pulmonary
 edema. Small layering bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are magnified by the projection. The patient has had prior cervical spine
 fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip now projecting
 over the proximal right pulmonary artery.
 Stable moderate pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
