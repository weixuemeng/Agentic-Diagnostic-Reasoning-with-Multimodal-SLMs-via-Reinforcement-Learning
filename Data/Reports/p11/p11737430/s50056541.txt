                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph provided.  Lung volumes are quite low.  Heart
 appears mildly enlarged.  There is increased pulmonary opacity noted
 bilaterally, which in part could be exaggerated due to low lung volumes and
 bronchovascular crowding, though mild edema is difficult to exclude. 
 Curvilinear calcification projecting over the heart likely reflects mitral
 annular calcification.  The mediastinal contour is poorly assessed.  Clips in
 the right upper quadrant noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with probable mild pulmonary edema.  Limited
 exam due to low lung volumes.
