                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and malaise; please evaluate for focal infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable mediastinal and
 hilar contours.  Cardiac contour is top normal.  Low lung volumes noted
 bilaterally with vascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  Faint
 retrocardiac opacity noted on frontal view likely represents atelectasis or
 scarring, though cannot entirely exclude infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal cardiac silhouette with faint retrocardiac opacity,
 likely atelectasis given low lung volumes, cannot entirely exclude pneumonia,
 but unlikely given the lack of evidence change.
