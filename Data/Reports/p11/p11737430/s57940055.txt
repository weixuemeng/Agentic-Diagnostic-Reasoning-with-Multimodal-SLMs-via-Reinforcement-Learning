                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, found down.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Scattered reticular nodular
 opacities are similar to that seen on prior exam, and likely represent areas
 of chronic scarring.  There is, however, more nodular opacity in the right mid
 and lower periphery of the lung, which could represent a component of
 aspiration.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.  No
 bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable scattered areas of chronic scarring with possible subtle
 areas of aspiration.
