                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Gastroparesis, abdominal pain, and hematemesis.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Patchy opacification in the left mid lung suggests
 atelectasis or scarring, noting that it was already present and similar extent
 with a somewhat shifting morphology.  There is no free air or
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar patchy left mid lung opacity, probably due to atelectasis
 or scarring, noting the lack of change in absence of pulmonary symptoms.  No
 evidence of free air or pneumomediastinum.
