 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD, sepsis, fluid overload  // does this
 patient have pulmonary edema?      does this patient have pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 06:32.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___, with an upper lobe
 predominance, and improved substantially by ___ at 06:32.  Subsequently
 it has worsened slightly.  The upper lobe consolidation could be nondependent
 edema, particularly if the patient is kept in Trendelenburg position.  Very
 asymmetric pulmonary edema is also seen in patients with chronic renal
 failure.  If however it persists alternative diagnoses should be considered
 including pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly has worsened slightly over the course of the
 day.  Pleural effusion is small if any.
