                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  There is still some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  A more localized area of increased opacification is seen in the
 right mid and lower lung zones.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this
 could reflect developing pneumonia.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the
 bases.
