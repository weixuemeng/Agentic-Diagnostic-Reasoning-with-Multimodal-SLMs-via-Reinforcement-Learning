                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with seizures and intubation, evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 Evaluation is limited due to patient rotation.  The lungs are low in volume
 but without focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Apparent shift of mediastinal structures is likely related to patient
 rotation.  An ET tube terminates deep into the carina and should be withdrawn
 by 3-4 cm.  An NG tube is aeen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified on this study.  Right subclavian PICC catheter has its tip in the
 proximal to mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  An ET tube terminates deep within the trachea
 and should be withdrawn by 3 cm.
 
 These findings were communicated to ___ at 12:30 a.m. on ___.
