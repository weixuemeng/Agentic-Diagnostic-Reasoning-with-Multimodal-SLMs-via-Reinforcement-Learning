                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory
 failure, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 15:47.
 
 Single portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patient is markedly rotated to the right which limits evaluation of the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours, but they are likely essentially unchanged. 
 There is persistent mild pulmonary edema in the setting of low lung volumes,
 which appears to be worsening when compared to the previous study.  A diffuse
 pneumonia would be less likely.  Small layering effusions likely unchanged. No
 pneumothorax.  Linear opacity at the right lung base likely reflect
 subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 2.  Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the superior vena cava.
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
