                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old found unresponsive, likely with urosepsis,
 intubated, ET has been repositioned, check location and evaluate for
 aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:15 a.m.
 
 Single portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 07:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip possibly within the distal stomach or proximal small bowel.  Right
 subclavian PICC line as it has tip in the mid superior vena cava.  Lung
 volumes remain low with patchy, predominantly basilar opacities suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia or aspiration would be less likely.  Crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces.
