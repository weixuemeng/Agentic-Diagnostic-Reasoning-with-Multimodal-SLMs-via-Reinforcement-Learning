                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with bacteremia status post extubation. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left internal jugular approach venous catheter tip projects within the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  There is persistent bibasilar, left greater than right,
 asymmetric opacification, atelectasis on the right and likely atelectasis on
 the left, though infection remains a possibility.  There is mild vascular
 engorgement and interstitial pulmonary edema, unchanged.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Likely bibasilar atelectasis; however pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
