                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison
 with prior chest radiographs through ___, with the most recent
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Linear opacity reflecting atelectasis at the
 right lung base is unchanged.  Multiple ill-defined peribronchial opacities in
 the right mid and lower lung and left lower lung are concerning for
 aspiration; however, in an appropriate clinical setting, possibility of
 multifocal infection need to be considered and requires further clinical
 correlation.  Since the patient is rotated, assessment of cardiomediastinal
 silhouette was limited, however, grossly appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lung and right mid lung small peribronchial
 opacities are concerning for aspiration; however, in an appropriate clinical
 setting, may represent multifocal infection and requires further clinical
 correlation.
