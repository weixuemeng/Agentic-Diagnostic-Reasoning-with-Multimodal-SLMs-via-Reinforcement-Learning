  1. Extensive subcutaneous edema is expected post surgery.  Correlation with
  surgical history is recommended.  No definite pneumothorax.
  
  2. Low lung volumes with vascular congestion.
  
  3. Retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis however
  differential includes postsurgical change and less likely pneumonia

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ___ fundoplication  // please evalaute  
 please evalaute
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are very low, with most severe atelectasis at the left lung base,
 crowding the pulmonary vasculature making it difficult to exclude mild edema. 
 The heart is normal size.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Tiny left
 apical air collection could be extra pleural, in the setting of extensive
 pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and right chest wall,
 as commonly seen after laparoscopic surgery.
 
 Esophageal drainage tube passes to the distal stomach but the tip
