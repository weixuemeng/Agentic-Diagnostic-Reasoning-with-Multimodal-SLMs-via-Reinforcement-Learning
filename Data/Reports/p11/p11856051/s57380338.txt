 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.Unusual contour of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is compatible with known history of

 chest wall.  Abandoned pacer leads project over the left chest wall and left
 upper abdomen.  The lungs are clear without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Subtle sternal closure device is noted.  Bony
 structures are intact.
