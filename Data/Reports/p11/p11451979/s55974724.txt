 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of end-stage renal disease, recent
 non-ST elevated myocardial infarction, now with flash edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recent chest radiograph taken earlier the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe pulmonary edema is unchanged with slightly increased
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Internal jugular catheter now terminates
 appropriately within the upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly worsening pulmonary edema with increase in cardiomegaly
 consistent with severe volume overload.  Hemodialysis would not be
 contraindicated given these findings.
