                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 7:41
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF and pulmonary edema.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study ___ at 8:24.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 7:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stably enlarged heart and
 stable mediastinal contours.  Right internal jugular introducer catheter with
 its tip in the distal SVC unchanged.  Left PICC line is difficult to visualize
 due to overlying EKG wires but also appears to terminate in the distal SVC
 near the cavoatrial junction.  Improving bilateral interstitial abnormality
 which likely reflects improving interstitial edema.  Underlying interstitial
 lung disease also should be considered.  No large pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
