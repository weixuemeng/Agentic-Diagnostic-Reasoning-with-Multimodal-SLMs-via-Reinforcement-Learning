                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD and ESR with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion in a patient with intact
 midline sternal wires after CABG procedure.  Central catheter extends to the
 lower portion of the SVC.  There is some asymmetry of opacification especially
 at the right base.  This could merely reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.
