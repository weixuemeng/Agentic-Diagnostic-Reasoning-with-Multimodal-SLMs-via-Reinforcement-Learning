 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post prior median sternotomy and coronary
 artery bypass surgery.  Heart remains enlarged and is accompanied by worsening
 bilateral heterogeneous opacities, which probably reflect pulmonary edema
 although underlying infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
