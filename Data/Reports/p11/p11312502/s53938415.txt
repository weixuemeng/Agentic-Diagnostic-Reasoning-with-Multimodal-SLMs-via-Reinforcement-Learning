                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Left PICC ___ ___  // Repeat film to
 check PICC location ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip is at the junction of the left and right brachiocephalic veins. 
 ET tube tip is approximately 2.9 cm above the carina.  Side port of the NG
 tube is just below the GE junction, with the tip in the stomach.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and cause bronchovascular crowding. 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to prior. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis and silhouetting of the medial left hemidiaphragm are
 similar to prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  Borderline edema, left lung
 unchanged.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Heart is
 moderately enlarged.  Trace pleural effusions, if any.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left PICC tip is at the junction of the left and right brachiocephalic
 veins.
 2. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis, and mild edema, left lung both similar
 to prior.
