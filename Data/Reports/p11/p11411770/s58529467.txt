 FINDINGS: 
 
 Support devices including ET tube, enteric tube and right subclavian central
 venous line have been removed. Lung volumes are low and the view is somewhat
 lordotic. However, there is a new airspace opacity projecting over the right
 heart border, and increased retrocardiac opacification, which may be due to
 aspiration or infection. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is
 no pneumothorax. Nodular opacity projecting over the left sixth interspace
 likely represents a nipple shadow. The heart and mediastinum are within normal
 limits despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right basilar airspace opacity, and increased retrocardiac opacification,
 may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
 Stable small right pleural effusion.
