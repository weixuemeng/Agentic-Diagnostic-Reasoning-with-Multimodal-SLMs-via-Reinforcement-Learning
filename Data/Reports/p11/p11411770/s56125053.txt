                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with new intubation. Assess endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube
 coursing midline with tip within the stomach and side port at the level of the
 diaphragm. An endotracheal tube is 2.4 cm above the level of the carina within
 the lower trachea.
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with bilateral perihilar interstitial
 prominence consistent with vascular crowding. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is likely related to patient positioning and
 low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates multilevel
 degenerative changes. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Enteric feeding tube with tip in stomach and side port at the level of
 diaphragm. Consider advancing 3-5 cm for better positioning. Endotracheal tube
 in appropriate position.
 2. Mildly hypoinflated lungs.
