                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 17:05
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post orogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 11:21.
 
 Supine portable chest film ___ at 17:05 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Volumes
 remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vascularity.  However, the pulmonary
 vascularity does appear more indistinct when compared to the preoperative
 study and therefore, this likely represents an element of superimposed mild
 interstitial edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in patient rotation between the studies.  Hardware
 overlies the lower cervical spine.  There are degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint with flattening of the humeral head and associated
 sclerosis which raises concern for avascular necrosis secondary to prior
 humeral head fracture.  Clinical correlation is advised.
