                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pleural effusion after recent cardiac surgery. 
 Evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs spanning from ___ to
 ___.  The ___ film was a pre-operative assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with the most recent radiograph performed approximately 24
 hours prior to this exam, there is no significant change in degree of
 bilateral pleural effusion, with a small right-sided pleural effusion and a
 moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  No focal parenchymal opacities are seen in the aerated part of
 the lungs.  There is no widening of the upper mediastinum.  Assessment of
 cardiac size cannot be performed due to obscuration of the left heart border.
 Sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal surgical clips are from recent CABG. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in burden of bilateral pleural
 effusions, left worse than right, compared with exam performed 24 hours prior.
 Associated left basilar atelectasis is present, infection not excluded.
