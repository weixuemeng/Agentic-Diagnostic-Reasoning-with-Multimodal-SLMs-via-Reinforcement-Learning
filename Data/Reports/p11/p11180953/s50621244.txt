                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for pneumothorax after chest tube
 removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval left
 chest tube removal with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Additionally, there has
 been interval extubation and as a consequence, reduced lung volumes
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and causing crowding of the vasculature. 
 The right internal jugular catheter is unchanged.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and left
 chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.
