                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Afib status post Whipple.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Mild vascular congestion has minimally improved. 
 Bibasilar opacities have increased.  This could be due to increasing
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The amount of
 pleural effusions are likely small.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right IJ
 catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomegaly is mild-to-moderate.
 Pacemaker lead tip is in the right ventricle.
