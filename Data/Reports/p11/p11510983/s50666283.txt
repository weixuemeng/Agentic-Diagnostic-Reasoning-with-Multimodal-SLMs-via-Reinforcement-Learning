                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:56 P.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Postop day 5 after Whipple procedure.  Continued shortness of
 breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low, due to substantial bibasilar atelectasis, and
 there is also at least a small amount of pleural fluid on both sides of the
 chest.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged as before, but
 there is no pulmonary edema.  Right ventricular transvenous pacer lead follows
 the expected course.
