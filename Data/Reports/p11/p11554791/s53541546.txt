                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncopal episode.  Question intrathoracic process.
 
 CHEST:  TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 Possible ectasia of the proximal aortic knob.  The left hilum is not well
 seen, but the right hilum is prominent, with a tapered appearance, suggestive
 of pulmonary hypertension.  Right paratracheal soft tissues most likely
 reflect ectatic vascular structures in someone of this age.  There is minimal
 upper zone redistribution, likely related to COPD.  No CHF.  No focal
 infiltrate or gross effusion.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 posteriorly is present. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is osteopenia and degenerative change in the thoracic spine, with
 accentuated kyphosis.  There is also slight anterior wedging of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body, ? T7, likely old.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hyperinflation consistent with COPD, wit probably pumonary hypertension. 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.  
 3.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles, but doubt acute pulmonary
 process.  
 4.  Compared with AP view from ___, no significant interval change is
 detected.
