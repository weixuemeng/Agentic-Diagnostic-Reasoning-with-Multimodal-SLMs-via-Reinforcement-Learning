                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  A linear left basilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a
 persistent pleural effusion.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left-sided pleural effusion and patchy basilar opacity
 suggesting atelectasis.
