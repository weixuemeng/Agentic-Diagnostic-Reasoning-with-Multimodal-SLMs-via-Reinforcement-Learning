                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  RA with weight loss.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again, there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
 predominantly involving the left ventricle.  No evidence of acute pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  There are, however, still some
 prominent interstitial markings at the bases.  Once again, consistent with
 some lower lung pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiolitis, as seen on a CT of
 ___.
