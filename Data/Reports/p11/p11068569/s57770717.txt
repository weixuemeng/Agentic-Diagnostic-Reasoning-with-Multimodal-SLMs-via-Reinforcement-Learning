                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent ex lap and washout for intra-abdominal abscess
 now with increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  Given this, no definite focal
 consolidation is identified.  No large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 There may be minimal vascular congestion.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal due to underpenetration from overlying body habitus. 
 However, no definite focal consolidation.  Central vascular engorgement.
