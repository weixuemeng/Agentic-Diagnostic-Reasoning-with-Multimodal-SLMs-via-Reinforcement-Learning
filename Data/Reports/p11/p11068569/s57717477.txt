 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:52 PM
  ETT appears in standard position, although precise location of carina is
  difficult to assess. Tubular opacity projecting over left lung apex may be a
  new LIJ line, if so, it remains in the left internal jugular vein.
  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours stable. Mild pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 09:36
 a.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is mild progression of the left lung opacities
 that might reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, attention on the subsequent
 studies is required.
 
 The left central venous line tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial
 junction.
