                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pmh of LLL mass recent biopsy 2 days ago coming
 in 2x hemoptysis  // Assess for effusion/opacities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stable in size.  Again noted is prominence of the
 hila consistent adenopathy seen on prior CT.  A left posterior lower lobe mass
 is again seen, as demonstrated by opacity overlying the spine on the lateral
 view, better assessed on recent CT. Multiple metastases are better identified
 on chest CT.  A right-sided Bochdalek hernia is again demonstrated.  Again
 seen is left basilar opacity, not significantly changed since recent
 examination.  Subtle blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle may be
 due to a trace pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Again seen posterior left lower lobe mass and hilar adenopathy, better
 assessed on recent prior CT.
 2.  Subtle blunting of posterior costophrenic angle may be due to trace
 pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
