                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis, s/p biopsy on ___ of LLL mass 
 // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 Chest radiographs dated ___.
 CT chest without contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again visualized is the large posterior left lung mass overlying the spine,
 better visualized on the recent CT.  The multiple metastatic nodules are also
 better characterized on the recent CT.  Bilateral lower lung predominant
 interstitial opacities are present, similar to ___ radiograph. 
 There are stable small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable in appearance.  The bilateral hilar enlargement is due to
 adenopathy, unchanged from prior.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable large left posterior left lung mass with multiple metastatic
 nodules, better characterized on the recent CT.
 2. Interstitial thickening may represent edema, an atypical infection, and
 less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis given the lack of significant
 interstitial thickening on the recent CT.
 3. Persistent intrathoracic adenopathy.
 4. Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to ensure resolution
 of the interstitial process.
 
 NOTIFICATIONS:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:12 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
