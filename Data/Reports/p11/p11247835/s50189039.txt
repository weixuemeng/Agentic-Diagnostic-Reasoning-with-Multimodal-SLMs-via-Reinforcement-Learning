                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Desaturation after abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions layer posteriorly.  Aside from moderate left
 basal atelectasis, lungs are clear.  The right hilus may be enlarged, but
 there is no evidence elsewhere of central lymph node enlargement.  Prior CXR
 should be obtained for side for side comparison. Heart size is normal.
 
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary
 embolism.
