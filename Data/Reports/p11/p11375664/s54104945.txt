                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 Two views were obtained of the chest in a markedly kyphotic position.  Within
 this limitation, the lungs are well expanded and clear aside from linear left
 lung atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is
 exaggerated in size, but likely top normal. Unchanged lower thoracic
 compression fracture contributes to kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process on this limited study.
