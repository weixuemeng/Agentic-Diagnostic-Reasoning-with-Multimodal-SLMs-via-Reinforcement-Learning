                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Consolidative opacity
 in the peripheral right lower lung is new.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated
 with flattening of the diaphragms, consistent with COPD.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is similar to prior and consistent with pleural
 thickening.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Top normal heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Peripheral right lower lung consolidative opacity is consistent with
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. Infarction is not excluded. If
 there is concern for a pulmonary embolus, then CTA of the chest is
 recommended.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs, suggestive of COPD.
