                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, sputum production
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar.  Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with upper lobe
 predominant mild to moderate emphysema.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Linear
 and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect a combination of
 scarring and atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 chronic, likely reflective of pleural thickening.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is otherwise demonstrated.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema.  Scarring and/or atelectasis in the lung bases.  No new focal
 consolidation.
