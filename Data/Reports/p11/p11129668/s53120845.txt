                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD with wheezing,
 productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter
 consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The posterior
 costophrenic angles are slightly more blunted as compared to the prior study
 and very trace pleural effusion are not excluded.  Linear left perihilar
 opacity is seen, most likely due to atelectasis.  Patchy left base opacity is
 slightly increased since the prior study which could be due to atelectasis,
 although underlying infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
