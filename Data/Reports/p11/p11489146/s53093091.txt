                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pneumothorax after pigtail catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right pleural pigtail
 catheter with interval re-expansion of the atelectatic right lung and
 decreased size of the right pneumothorax with a small residual pneumothorax
 remaining.  It is approximately 5 mm in width.  Previously noted signs of
 tension have resolved, as the mediastinum now is in normal position and no
 longer pushed leftward.  The cardiac size is normal.  There is a small amount
 of linear atelectasis at the right base.  There is no evidence of
 consolidation or re-expansion edema. No large pleural effusion is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Interval placement of right pleural pigtail catheter with small residual
 right pneumothorax and resolution of previously noted tension. 
 2. Right basilar atelectasis.
