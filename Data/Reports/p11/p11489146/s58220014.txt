                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post right-sided VATS
 pleurodesis.  Evaluate for interval change and remaining pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The previously persisting postoperative
 pleural densities have markedly improved, the diaphragm now in almost normal
 position with a small blunting density obscuring the lateral right pleural
 sinus, but not extending significantly in the posterior area.  Mild degree of
 pleural space thickening (less than 2 mm) remains along the right lateral
 chest wall and extends in the apical area.  A vertically oriented density
 exists in the apical area of the right upper lobe and most likely represents
 scar formations after the apical blebectomy.  No residual pneumothorax can be
 identified.  Heart size is normal, and mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable.  Left-sided hemithorax appears quite normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further resolution of postoperative pleural changes, no residual
 pneumothorax.  No new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities.
