                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with known aortic stenosis and recent
 pneumonia, evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright position
 using AP frontal and left lateral views.  There is moderate cardiac
 enlargement.  The configuration demonstrates a prominence of the left
 ventricular contour and some mild enlargement of the left atrium as well.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows prominent calcium
 deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  No local aneurysmatic
 contour abnormalities identified.  The pulmonary vasculature shows an upper
 zone re-distribution pattern, but there is absence of interstitial or alveolar
 edema and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  No evidence
 of acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present, and no pneumothorax is
 seen in the apical area.  Skeletal structures demonstrate a moderately
 compressed vertebral body in the mid portion of the thoracic spine, but no
 other gross skeletal abnormalities identified.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac enlargement and thoracic widening and elongation in
 elderly female patient with upper zone re-distribution pattern but absence of
 acute CHF.  No pleural effusion or acute infiltrates identified.
