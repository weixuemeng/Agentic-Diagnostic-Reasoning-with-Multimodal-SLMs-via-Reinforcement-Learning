                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Comparing these chest radiographs with studies performed elsewhere
 ___ and prior radiographs here ___:  B opacities
 projecting over the thoracic spine are combination of osteophytes and
 discogenic sclerosis.  There are no lung lesions or evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman, follow up CXR to pneumonia seen at ___ Urgernt
 Care on ___: "Patchy opacities in the superior segment of the left lower
 lobe, best appreciated on lateral view suspicious for pneumonia." Suggested
 ___ week follow up.  // F/U pneumonia in LLL   F/U pneumonia in LLL
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Only prior chest radiographs available are from ___.
 Unfortunately referenced radiographs from ___ in ___ are not available.
 
 On the frontal view the only abnormality in the lungs is a small region of
 atelectasis or scarring in the left lower lung.  On the lateral view there is
 abnormal radiodensity projecting over the mid thoracic spine.  This could be a
 lung lesion or sclerosis in the vertebral body.  Oblique views should be able
 to distinguish between the 2.  Prior chest radiographs must be obtained.
 
 Heart size normal.  No evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Mild
 distention of the esophagus from the carina to the diaphragm suggests
 swallowing abnormality.  Clinical correlation advised.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Oblique chest radiographs.
 
 Prior chest radiograph should be obtained for side-by-side comparison.
