                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Lungs are clear except for patchy and linear opacities at the right
 lung base, which favor atelectasis.  Aspiration and early pneumonia are
 additional considerations, and followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
