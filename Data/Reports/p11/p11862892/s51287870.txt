                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP semi-upright portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating at the level of the carina. 
 Recommend withdrawal by approximately 3 cm.  An enteric tube is seen coursing
 below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the
 stomach.  A right Port-A-Cath is seen terminating approximately at the level
 of the mid SVC.  There is left base retrocardiac opacity which may be due to
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is
 not excluded.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen and a
 trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina, recommend
 withdrawal by approximately 3 cm for more appropriate positioning.  Finding
 was discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:09 p.m. on ___ one minute
 after discovery.  Enteric tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis; however, consolidation due to infection and/or
 aspiration may also be present.
 3.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a trace
 pleural effusion.
 4.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.
