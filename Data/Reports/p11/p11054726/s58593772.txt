                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // eval acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Interval increased airspace opacity at the left lung base may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and a dilated pulmonary conus are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with left lower lobe airspace opacity may represent
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
 The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, if this is suspected
 clinically, a chest CT angio may be obtained for further evaluation.
