                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post cardiac arrest, now extubated with
 persistent fever.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is a stable-appearing
 retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  A small right-sided pleural effusion is
 present.  No pneumothorax.  Right internal jugular central venous line ends at
 the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
