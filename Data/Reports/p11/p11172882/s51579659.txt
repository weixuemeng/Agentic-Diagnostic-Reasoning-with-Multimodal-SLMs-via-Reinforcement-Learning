                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, status post cardiac arrest, status post cooling,
 now with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There has been an interval increase in the degree of
 retrocardiac opacity, which may represent developing pneumonia. Right basalar
 atelectasis is not significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax or
 significant pleural effusion.  Endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the
 carina.  A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid
 SVC.  The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach with the last sideport above
 the GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina and should be pulled
 back 2-3cm.
 2.  The NG tube ends in the stomach with the last sideport above the GE
 junction, and should be advanced prior to use. 
 3.  There has been an interval increase in the degree of retrocardiac opacity,
 which may represent developing pneumonia.
 
 COMMENTS: Impression # 1 and 2 were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at approximately 10am on ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
