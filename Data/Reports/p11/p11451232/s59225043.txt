                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mitral stenosis with valvuloplasty.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, especially the left atrium, with posterior prominence of the upper
 portion of the cardiac silhouette and elevation of the left main stem
 bronchus.  Some prominence of central vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Marked tortuosity of the aorta is seen.
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly could represent small
 effusions or pleural thickening.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note is substantial degenerative change involving the lower
 thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
