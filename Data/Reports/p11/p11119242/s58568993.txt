 lung area.  Better seen on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph are
 bilateral pleural effusions, restricted to the lateral and dorsal aspect  's
 of the costophrenic sinuses.  No new focal parenchymal opacity.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild elongation of the descending aorta. 
 Unchanged position of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
