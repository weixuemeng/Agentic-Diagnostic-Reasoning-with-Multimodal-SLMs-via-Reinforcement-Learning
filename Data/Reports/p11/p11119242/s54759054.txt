 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatic ca p/w SOB  // Pulmonary edema vs
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, similar in position. The pneumothorax is
 seen. There are low lung volumes and probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions. Bilateral perihilar opacities suggests mild pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and
 pulmonary edema, although infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
