                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abnormal CXR ___. Assess for
 resolution.  // SOB. Assess for resolution of abnormalities noted ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. A dual lead
 left chest wall pacer is in unchanged position with the leads in the expected
 location of the right atrium right ventricle.  The previously seen multifocal
 opacities have largely resolved; however, there is a new focal opacity in the
 right middle lobe and possibly in the left lower lobe. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolution of previously seen multifocal right pulmonary opacities with new
 right mid lung and left lower lobe opacities.  Given the waxing and waning
 fleeting opacities, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or Loffler syndrome are
 on the differential. Vasculitis is also possible; although, less likely given
 the time course. If clinically warranted correlation with tissue diagnosis
 could be considered.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 15:11 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
