                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.  No prior chest radiograph
 images are available for comparison as the PACS system is unable to fetch
 archived images at this time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms and
 hyperexpansion of the lungs compatible with COPD.  Ill-defined airspace
 opacities in the right mid lung zone may represent infectious foci; however,
 pulmonary nodules or masses are not excluded.  No significant pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and
 there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged as noted on prior studies.  A left pectoral pacemaker is
 in place with two leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 respectively.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The right
 hilum is prominent on the current examination.  The trachea is midline.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  New ill-defined nodular opacities of the right mid lung concerning for
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.  A followup chest radiograph is
 recommended in 6 weeks' time after a course of treatment to confirm
 resolution.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of acute congestive heart failure.
