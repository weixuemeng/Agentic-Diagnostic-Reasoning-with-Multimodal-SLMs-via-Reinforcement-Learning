                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with suprarenal mass and IVC thrombus, assess for
 lung mets.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinum is widened suggesting mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  There are minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  Small
 nodular opacities in the upper lobes are concerning for metastases.  There is
 no evidence of consolidation or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widened mediastinum suggesting mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Tiny
 lung nodules are worrisome for metastases.  CT of the chest is recommended.
