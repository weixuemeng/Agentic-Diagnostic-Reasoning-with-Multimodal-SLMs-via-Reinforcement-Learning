                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  No acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of infectious pneumonia or
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  If clinical suspicion is high for
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis, high-resolution CT may be considered as it is
 more sensitive than radiographs for detection of this condition.
