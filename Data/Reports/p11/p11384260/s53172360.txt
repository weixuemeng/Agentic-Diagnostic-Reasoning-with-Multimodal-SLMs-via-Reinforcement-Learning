                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic lung cancer, now
 presenting with acute chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from
 ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities within the left lung base
 are similar to prior and likely reflects atelectatic scarring.  No
 superimposed confluent consolidation is identified.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles remains mild and may reflect chronic pleural thickening or
 small effusions.  No pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions are evident. 
 A right upper paramediastinal mass lesion corresponds with patient's known
 primary lung carcinoma and is better characterized on recent CT.  Known
 diffuse osseous metastases are not well characterized on this chest
 radiographic examination.  No obvious compression deformity of the thoracic
 spine is evident, though evaluation is limited due to patient's arm position. 
 Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable appearance of known primary lung cancer and left basilar scarring. 
 No superimposed cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Known diffuse osseous metastases not well evaluated on this radiographic
 examination.
