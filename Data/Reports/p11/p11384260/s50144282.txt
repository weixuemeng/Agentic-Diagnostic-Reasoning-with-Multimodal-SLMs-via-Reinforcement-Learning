                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bilateral rib pain and productive cough. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to chest CT from ___, ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a right IJ central venous catheter in a left PICC. 
 Partially imaged hardware is seen in the lower cervical spine.  There is
 slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles, which may be
 due to trace effusions.  There is some linear left base atelectasis/scarring. 
 Right paratracheal opacity is stable.  The hilar contours are stable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles
 may be due to trace pleural effusions.  Left base atelectasis.  Stable right
 paramediastinal opacity.
