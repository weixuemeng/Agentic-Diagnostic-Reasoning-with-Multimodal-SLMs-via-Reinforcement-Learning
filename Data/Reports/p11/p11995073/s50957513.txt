                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of kidney transplant, now
 with fever and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities are identified.  Thoracic aorta of normal dimension; however,
 some linear calcium deposits are seen in the wall of the descending aorta. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  A sharply delineated triangular
 area of parenchymal consolidation is seen in the right upper lobe area
 laterally and posteriorly.  This is rather typical for a pneumonic infiltrate.
 No other pulmonary abnormalities are seen beyond some mild blunting of the
 lateral pleural sinuses and relatively low positioned and flattened
 diaphragms, suggestive of COPD.  When comparison is made with the next
 preceding portable chest examination of ___, the patient had, at
 that time, a PICC line in place.  Findings for possible COPD exists already;
 however, the now present acute infiltrate in the right upper lobe area was not
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New pneumonic infiltrate.  Follow up after successful treatment
 is recommended.
