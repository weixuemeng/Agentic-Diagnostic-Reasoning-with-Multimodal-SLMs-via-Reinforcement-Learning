                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and leukocytosis. Recently completed
 treatment for pneumonia  // ?Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The opacity previously seen in the right right mid/upper zone is larger and
 less distinct, suggesting progression.  There is more pronounced patchy
 opacity at the left base.  There is also a new small left pleural effusion. 
 Previously seen right infrahilar patchy opacities obscured by surrounding
 vascular plethora.  There is increased vascular plethora, consistent with mild
 CHF.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly increased.
 
 Note is again made of a partially imaged left total shoulder prosthesis. 
 Slight flattening of the right humeral head is included in suggest the
 presence of osteonecrosis or impaction injury involving the right humeral
 head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild vascular plethora, increased compared with ___, consistent with
 CHF.
 
 Larger right mid/ upper opacity and increased in left infrahilar opacity
 concerning for pneumonic infiltrates.  These must be followed to resolution to
 exclude underlying chronic abnormalities.
 
 New small left effusion with underlying atelectasis.
 
 Suspect osteonecrosis with subtle articular surface collapse of the right
 humeral head.  There clinically indicated, MRI could help to confirm this.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Larger right mid/ upper opacity and increased in left
 infrahilar opacity concerning for pneumonic infiltrates. These must be
 followed to resolution to exclude underlying chronic abnormalities.
