                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Carpal chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GIB  // new ETT -- assess position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of a
 endotracheal tube that terminates 2.7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube has
 been removed.  Aortic stent is unchanged in position.
 
 There is the right lung base opacity, which may be due to pleural effusion
 and/or atelectasis, but pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Curvilinear opacity along the medial aspect of the right
 upper hemithorax represents wall of the persistently dilated esophagus. Left
 lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates 2.7 cm above
 the carina.
 2. Persistent right lung base opacity, which may be due to pleural effusion
 and/or atelectasis. Consider pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
