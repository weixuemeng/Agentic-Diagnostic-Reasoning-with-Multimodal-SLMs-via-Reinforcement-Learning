 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left thoracocentesis, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 left thoracocentesis.  A new pigtail catheter was inserted into the left
 pleural space.  A pre-existing left pleural effusion is completely drained,
 there is no post-procedural left pneumothorax.  The aortic stent graft, the
 right internal jugular vein catheter and the appearance of the right
 hemithorax, including the known right pleural effusion, are constant.
