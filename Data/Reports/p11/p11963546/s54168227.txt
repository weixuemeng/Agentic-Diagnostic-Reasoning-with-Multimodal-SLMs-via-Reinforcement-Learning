                                 FINAL REPORT

 HISTORY:  Pre-op vascular graft.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Either the patient has had an esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, or she
 suffers from either achalasia or very distended esophagus from other cause. 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are present, age
 indeterminate.  Heart is moderately to severely enlarged.  Thoracic aorta is
 generally large and tortuous.  Presumably, there is other imaging on which to
 assess the aorta.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings by telephone at 2:30pm as soon as the
