                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post ___ myotomy and EGD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph dated ___. Correlation also made to
 CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The endotracheal
 tube terminates low in the distal trachea.  A thoracic aortic stent is in
 place with no evidence of kinks or discontinuities.  New retrocardiac airspace
 opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax but
 minimal post-procedural pneumomediastinum. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There
 is new moderate subcutaneous emphysema in the bilateral supraclavicular
 regions and left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac airspace opacity is most likely due to atelectasis.
 Stable cardiomegaly.
 New minimal post-procedural pneumomediastinum and moderate chest wall
 subcutaneous emphysema.
