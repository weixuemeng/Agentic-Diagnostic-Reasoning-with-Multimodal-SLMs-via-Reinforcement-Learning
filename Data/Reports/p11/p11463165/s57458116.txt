                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pacemaker placed, intermittent capture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left-sided
 pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is rotated to the left.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly
 stable.  There is left basilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is seen and there may be a trace pleural effusion.  Left
 basilar retrocardiac opacity may be due to a combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis; however, consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
