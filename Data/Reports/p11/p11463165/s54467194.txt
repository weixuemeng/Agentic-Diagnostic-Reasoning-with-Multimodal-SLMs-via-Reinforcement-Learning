                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right leg and hip pain status post fall.  Evaluate for evidence
 of fracture or bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left. There is no focal airspace
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Left retrocardiac opacity has improved since
 the prior study with some residual atelectasis at the left base.  There is no
 focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to patient
 rotation.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left chest
 wall pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Mid thoracic compression deformities are similar to prior studies.
 
 Although chest radiographs have limited sensitivity for rib fracture, no
 definite displaced fracture is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient is rotated to the left.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 Although chest radiographs have limited sensitivity for rib fractures, no
 displaced fracture is detected.
