                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, cough, crackles on the left.  Assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mildly enlarged cardiac
 silhouette which is partially obscured by an a dense left lower lobe
 opacification likely representing a combination of moderate pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.  However, underlying infectious process is not excluded. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Evidence of remote healed
 anterior right 3rd rib fracture identified.  Rounded ossific density
 projecting adjacent to the right coracoid process may represent a loose body
 within the joint space.  Significant degenerative change identified in the
 bilateral glenohumeral joints.
 
 Compared to ___, there has been interval progression of multiple thoracic and
 lumbar compression deformities including now almost complete loss of anterior
 vertebral body height of a mid thoracic vertebrae.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacification likely combination of atelectasis and moderate
 pleural effusion.  Underlying infectious process not excluded.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly, incompletely assessed by left lower lobe opacification.  
 
 Interval progression of multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebral compression
 deformities.
