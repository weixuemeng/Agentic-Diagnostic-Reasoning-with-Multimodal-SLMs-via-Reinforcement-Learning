                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased lethargy.  Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 7:40 today.
 
 FINDINGS: There is prominence of the vasculature which has increased from
 prior.  Additionaly, patchy opacities at the lung bases is more conspicuous on
 this study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Cervical orthopedic hardware is
 partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar patchy opacities are nonspecific but may be due to
 aspiration given clinical suspicion for this entity.  Worsened vascular
 congestion.
