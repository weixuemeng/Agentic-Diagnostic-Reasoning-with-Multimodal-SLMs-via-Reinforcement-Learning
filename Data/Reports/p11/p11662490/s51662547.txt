                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and possible aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The study is somewhat limited by motion.  There is improved aeration
 at the lung bases with increasing consolidation of the right mid-lung.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the lung bases with increasing consolidation
 in the right mid-lung.  These findings would be atypical for aspiration.
