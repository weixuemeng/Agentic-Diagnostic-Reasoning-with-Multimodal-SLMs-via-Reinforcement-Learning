                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough with history of CHF.  Evaluate for pneumonia or fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is unchanged marked enlargement of the heart.  As seen on
 ___, there are diffuse interstitial opacities with a perihilar
 and lower lobe predominance, consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac consolidation could be atelectasis or infection
 although it is not significantly changed compared to the prior study.  Left
 mid lung linear atelectasis is slightly increased.  There are moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema that is likely cardiogenic
 in nature, not significantly changed compared to ___.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac consolidation could be atelectasis although infection cannot
 be excluded.  Correlate clinically.
 
 3.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
