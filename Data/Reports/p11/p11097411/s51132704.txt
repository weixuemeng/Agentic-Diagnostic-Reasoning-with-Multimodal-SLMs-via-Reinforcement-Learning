                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleuritic flank pain, dyspnea on exertion. 
 Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Low lung volumes are
 seen.  Linear opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right are most
 suggestive of atelectasis; however, a component of consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Superiorly,
 the lungs are clear.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, potentially due to
 atelectasis given low lung volumes, however, component of infection cannot be
 excluded.
