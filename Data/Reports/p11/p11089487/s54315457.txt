                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation.  Please evaluate for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: ET tube terminates approximately 3.4-cm above the carina. There is
 an enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm, with the tip out of view of
 this film. There is a large distended, gas-filled loop of bowel traversing
 horizontally across the upper abdomen, better evaluated on the prior CT. The
 heart size is normal.  There is mild dilatation of the esophagus.  Opacities
 are seen at the right upper lung and bases of the lungs bilaterally. There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. ET tube terminates approximately 3.4 cm above the carina.
 
 2. Opacities at the lung bases may be secondary to aspiration/pneumonia.
 
 3. Gas-filled distended loop of bowel traversing across the abdomen, is better
 evaluated on the dedicated CT of the abdomen. Enteric tube extends below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film.
