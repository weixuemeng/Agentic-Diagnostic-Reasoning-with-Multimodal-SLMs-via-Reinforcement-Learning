                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p external approach to cricopharyngeal
 myotomy.  // eval for PTX, pneumomediastinum, subcut air in neck
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is air in the left subcutaneous
 soft tissues, postsurgical in origin.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is
 clearly identified. Known calcified pleural plaque on the left, causing
 hyperlucent stripes paralleling the left chest wall.  No pneumonia, no
 pulmonary edema.  To definitely rule out postoperative complications, a
 frontal and lateral chest radiograph within 24 hr should be performed.
