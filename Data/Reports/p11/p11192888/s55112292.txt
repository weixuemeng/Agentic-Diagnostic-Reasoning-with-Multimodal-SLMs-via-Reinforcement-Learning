  After diuresis, increased interstitial markings remain, which may be
  concerning for an infectious process. However, small bilateral pleural
  effusions are now noted, which may be more consistent with volume overload.
  Bilateral lower lobe opacities are improved, but still remain, especially on
  the left.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? of pneumonia versus volume overload now
 s/p diuresis  // reevaluate for infiltrate
