                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device, which appears unchanged. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Calcified pleural
 plaques along the left mid to upper left hemithorax appear similar.  The
 degree of pleural thickening and a possible small effusion of the left appear
 unchanged since the more recent of the two prior radiographs. A left basilar
 opacity has continued to improve, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.  Better aeration at the left lung base.
