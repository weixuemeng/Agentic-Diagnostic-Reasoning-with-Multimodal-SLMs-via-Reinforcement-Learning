                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Esophageal perforation,  aspiration, leukocytosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is minimal left basal opacity,
 overall unchanged since the prior study.  Dense calcifications projecting over
 the anterior lateral left chest wall are consistent with pleural plaques.  No
 interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax or new
 consolidations demonstrated.
