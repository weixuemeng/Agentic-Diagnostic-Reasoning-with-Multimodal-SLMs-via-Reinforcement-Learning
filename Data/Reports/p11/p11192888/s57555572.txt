 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Pleural

 costophrenic angle, which may be due to pleural thickening, although very
 trace pleural effusion not excluded.  No new focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
