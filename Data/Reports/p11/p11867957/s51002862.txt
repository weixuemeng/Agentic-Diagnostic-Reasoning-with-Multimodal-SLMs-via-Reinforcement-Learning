                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 orogastric tube is extremely difficult to identify.  It extends at least into
 the pyloric region where it takes a downward curve at the level of the iliac
 crest on the right.  Endotracheal tube remains in good position.  Bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications are again consistent with substantial layering
 effusions, compressive atelectasis at the bases, and elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
