 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of left PICC is directed laterally towards the lateral wall of
 the proximal superior vena cava at the level of the junction of the
 brachiocephalic veins, and does not make the expected downward turn within the
 superior vena cava.  Exam is otherwise unchanged since the recent study
 performed less than one hour earlier.  A nasogastric tube terminates below the
 diaphragm.
