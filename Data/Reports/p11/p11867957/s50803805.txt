 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.3 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube tip
 courses below the inferior aspect of the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior
 borders of the film.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Aortic knob is mildly calcified.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 is noted, with prominence of the hilar regions.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 noted.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific, and could reflect
 atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific but may
 reflect atelectasis, infection or aspiration.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube.
