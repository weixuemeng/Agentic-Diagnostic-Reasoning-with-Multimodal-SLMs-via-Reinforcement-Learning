                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic respiratory failure status post tracheostomy, on
 ventilator.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain low.  Hazy opacification of the right lung
 base likely reflects a layering small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  No
 significant pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Right basilar atelectasis
 is longstanding.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  A tracheostomy
 tube is in place.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Increased
 prominence of the mediastinum is related to patient positioning and tortuosity
 of the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and underlying
 atelectasis.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
