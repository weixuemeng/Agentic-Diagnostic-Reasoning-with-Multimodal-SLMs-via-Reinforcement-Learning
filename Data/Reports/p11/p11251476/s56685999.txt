 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, history of smoking and COPD, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms visible on the lateral radiograph,
 indicative of mild-to-moderate overinflation.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal structures.  In the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of a
 recent or newly appeared parenchymal opacity.  However, the lateral radiograph
 shows areas of mild bronchiectasis in the posterior portions of the right
 lower lobe.  These are unchanged in extent and severity as compared to the
 previous image.  No evidence of pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
