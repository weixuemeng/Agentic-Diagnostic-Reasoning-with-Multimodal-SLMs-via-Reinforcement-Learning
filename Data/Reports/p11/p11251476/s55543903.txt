                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD, bronchiectasis, urinary retention, groin
 and back pain.  Elevated ___ count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion.  No change in the appearance of the lower lungs on the lateral view
 where there is some suggestion of scarring or bronchiectasis in the posterior
 sulcus projecting over the spine.  Hilar and mediastinal contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  Diminished vascularity in the upper lungs is often an
 indication of emphysema, although overall lung volumes are not particularly
 hyperexpanded.
