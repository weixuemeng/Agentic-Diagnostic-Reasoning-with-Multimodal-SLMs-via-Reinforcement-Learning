                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:09 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, question edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 What was previously a moderate to large right pleural effusion freely layering
 posteriorly, is smaller, but with a larger subpulmonic component.  Lung
 volumes are generally smaller so that if there is any pulmonary edema, it is
 minimal.  Bibasilar opacification is due to either worsening atelectasis or
 developing consolidation in the lower lobes, probably the former.  Moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
