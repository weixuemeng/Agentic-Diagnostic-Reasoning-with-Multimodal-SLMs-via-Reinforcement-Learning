                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bilobar pneumonia, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Right basal consolidation appears to be progressing associated with slightly
 increased in the interim moderate right pleural effusion.  There is
 potentially also an element of atelectasis.  The cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Left lung is essentially clear as well as the right upper lobe.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Concern for interval progression of right lower lobe consolidation and slight
 increase in right pleural effusion.
