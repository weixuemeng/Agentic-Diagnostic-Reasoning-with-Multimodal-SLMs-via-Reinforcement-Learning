                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, status post intubation.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.  ___ radiograph from
 ___.  CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4.4 cm from the
 carina.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with
 the tip at the atriocaval junction.  An enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of field of view.  It is likely a post-pyloric
 position.
 
 There is improved aeration at the right base, though there are persistent
 bibasilar opacities, likely representing residual pneumonia.  The apices of
 the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Again, subcutaneous air is noted overlying the
 neck.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bibasilar opacities, though there is interval
 improvement in the aeration at the right base.
