                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Immunosuppression and acute desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:36 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right jugular central venous line ends in the upper right atrium.
 An enteric tube ends likely in the stomach.  The apical portions of the lungs
 were not imaged, but no large pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar consolidations
 are again seen.  There is slight increase in atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  No large pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged bibasilar consolidations which may represent pneumonia.
 Slight increase in right basilar atelectasis.  The apices of the lungs were
 not imaged, so small pneumothorax cannot be excluded, but there is no large
 pneumothorax.
