                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dermatomyositis and recent aspiration pneumonia.  Evaluate pneumonia
 versus aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, the most
 recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged mild cardiomegaly
 and low lung volumes. The right lower lung opacity has increased, most likely
 due to progression of the right lower lobe consolidation, but could be due to
 slightly lower lung volumes. In the case of progression of the consolidation,
 repeat aspiration cannot be differentiated from pneumonia.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing right lower lung opacity is most likely due to progression of the
 right lower lobe consolidation, and repeat aspiration cannot be differentiated
 from pneumonia. It is less likely due to lower lung volumes. 
 
 Clarification with repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs with an emphasis on
 inspiration may be helpful in determining true progression of the
 consolidation as opposed to changes due to low lung volumes. 
 
 These findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
