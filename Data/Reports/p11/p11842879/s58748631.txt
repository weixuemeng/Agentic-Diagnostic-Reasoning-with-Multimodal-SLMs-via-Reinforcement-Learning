                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:27 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old intubated woman.  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Extensive consolidation in the left lung is improving.  Less severe pneumonia
 right lower lobe looks a little smaller but this may be a function of better
 lung volumes today than on ___.  ET tube is in standard placement, NG
 tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach and feeding tube
 passes into the distal stomach and out of view.  Left jugular line ends low in
 the SVC.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed left greater than
 right but not increasing nor substantial.  Moderate cardiomegaly with
 particular contour abnormality suggesting enlargement of the main pulmonary
 artery displacing the left atrial appendage, is longstanding.
