                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated.  A nasogastric tube terminates in
 the stomach.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the lower superior vena cava.  Although an opacity has partly resolved in the
 right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe, there is a marked increase
 in retrocardiac opacification reflecting atelectasis or consolidation of the
 left lower lobe including air bronchograms.  Associated volume loss is
 suspected with new shift of mediastinal structures towards the left.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in opacification and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Improving right basilar opacification.  Status post endotracheal extubation.
