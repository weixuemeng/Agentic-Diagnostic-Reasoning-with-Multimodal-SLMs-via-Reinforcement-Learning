                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dermatomyositis and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate dense right lower lobe
 consolidation, which appears increased in size since the prior study.  New
 since the prior study is a left lower lobe consolidation which may represent
 atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  Lung volumes are decreased since the
 prior study.  Cardiac size is normal accounting for difference in technique. 
 The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Pocket of air in the left upper quadrant is
 extraluminal, as seen on the recent abdomen CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Enlarged right lower lobe opacity and new left lower lobe opacity concerning
 for new pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 Extraluminal free-air in the left upper quadrant seen on the recent CT.
