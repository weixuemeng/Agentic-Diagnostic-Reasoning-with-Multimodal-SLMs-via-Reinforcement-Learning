                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:57 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia, nausea and vomiting; is there
 pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been substantial improvement in what was acutely exacerbated
 pulmonary edema on ___.  Residual consolidation in the right lung,
 particularly the upper lobe, is suspicious for pneumonia and needs careful
 followup.  Lesser consolidation in the dependent lungs is more readily
 attributable to atelectasis and edema.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural
 effusions are small, if any.  No pneumothorax.
