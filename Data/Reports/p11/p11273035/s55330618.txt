                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute change in mental status and left
 facial droop.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a retrocardiac opacity which
 was not present in the prior exam.  No other focal opacities are noted. 
 Increased hilar prominence bilaterally may represent vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent left lower lobe peumonia versus
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Bilateral hilar prominence suggests fluid overload.
