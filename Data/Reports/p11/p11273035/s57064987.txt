 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia after administration of IV fluids. 
 Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed four hours prior to this exam during
 this admission.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Compared with prior exam, there are
 diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, right worse than left, mostly in a
 perihilar distribution with bilateral hilar engorgement compatible with new
 pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac opacity is redemonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New pulmonary edema.
 2.  Reidentified retrocardiac opacity compatible with left lower lobe
