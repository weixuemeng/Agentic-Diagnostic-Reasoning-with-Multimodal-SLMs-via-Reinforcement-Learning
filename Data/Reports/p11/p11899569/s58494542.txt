                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest tube placement for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 10:40 and chest radiograph ___
 09:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right apical chest tube.  Previously
 noted small right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the current
 radiograph.  There is persistent pneumomediastinum and extensive amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall bilaterally extending into the
 neck.  Curvilinear lucency in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is
 compatible with retroperitoneal subcutaneous emphysema, as seen on the
 previous CT.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Minimal patchy right basilar
 opacity likely reflects a small contusion.  Right posterior tenth rib fracture
 is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right apical chest tube with previously noted tiny right
 apical pneumothorax not visualized on the current radiograph. Persistent,
 extensive amounts of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.
