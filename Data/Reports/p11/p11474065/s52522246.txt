 pneumothoraces are also demonstrated.  Cardiac silhouette demonstrates left
 ventricular configuration is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Asymmetrically distributed heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower
 lobe could reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration, or hemorrhage in the post
 procedural setting.
