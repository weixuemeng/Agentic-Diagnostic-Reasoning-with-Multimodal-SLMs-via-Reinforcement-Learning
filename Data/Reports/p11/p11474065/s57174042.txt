                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post tracheoplasty via right
 chest performed on ___, check for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation.  The heart configuration suggests a relative prominence of
 the left ventricular contour, a finding which in conjunction with the
 moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the possibility of
 systemic hypertension.  There is no acute pulmonary congestion.  In the right
 hemithorax pleural thickenings are identified and seen to clear along the
 lateral chest wall.  This coincides with the previously described local
 resection of the posterior aspect of the fourth rib related to previously
 performed tracheal reconstruction.  These post-operative changes have not
 undergone any significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is present.  On
 the lateral view the posterior pleural sinuses are free from any free fluid,
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-operative chest findings.  No new acute infiltrates
 and no pneumothorax.
