                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of nausea, vomiting,
 status post colonoscopy, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 subtle nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right first ribs measuring
 1.1 cm and appears to have a lucent margin, suggesting that it is outside the
 patient.  Recommend clinical correlation for external artifact or any skin
 markings (mole/sking tag) at this site.  Suggest repeat radiograph with marker
 overlying any skin tags and oblique views to exclude a pulmonary nodule. 
 There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.  There are
 multiple air distended loops of bowel, partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 2.  Nodular opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax with thin
 lucent margins, suggest that it is external to the patient.  Recommend
 clinical correlation for external artifact or skin tag/mole and recomend
 repeat with marker overlying any skin findings as well as oblique views to
 exclude an underlying pulmonary nodule.
