                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral shoulder pain and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal size, slightly larger than the prior study. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The nipples projecting over the bilateral lower lungs should not be
 mistaken for lung nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.  Top normal heart size with
 interval increase in size of cardiac silhouette.
