 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ___ edema  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle 1 cm ovoid opacity projecting over the posterior right sixth rib may be
 due to overlap of structures however, recommend a shallow oblique radiographs
 to exclude underlying lesion.  The left lung is clear.  There is persistent
 slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle 1 cm ovoid opacity appears to project over the posterior right sixth
 rib may be due to overlap of structures however, recommend shallow oblique
 radiographs to exclude underlying lesion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Shallow oblique chest radiographs exclude lesion in the
 right lung.
