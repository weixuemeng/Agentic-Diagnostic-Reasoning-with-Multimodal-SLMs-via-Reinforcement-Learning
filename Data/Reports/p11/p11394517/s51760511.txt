                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Right middle lobe opacification, rule out CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Dual-chamber pacemaker appears in good position. 
 Dense opacity in the left lower lung zone may reflect old rib fracture.
 
 The opacity in the right mid lung zone has effectively resolved.  There is
 possibly old granulomatous disease.
 
 On the lateral view, a posterior opacity sharply bounded inferiorly, probably
 within the posterior segment of the upper lobe.  There are no correlations
 clearly identifiable on the frontal view.  This is unchanged from prior study,
 further evaluation of this is warranted.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Opacity in the frontal region effectively resolved, but there remains
 persistent opacity on the lateral view.
 
 No evidence of CHF.  Continued followup recommended.
