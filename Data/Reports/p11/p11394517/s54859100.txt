                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain shortness of breath and
 vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well-expanded. Compared with prior exam there is interval worsening
 of vascular congestion, more prominent in the right lung. Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. The small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly improved from
 prior. Retrocardiac opacities are stable from prior and likely atelectasis
 although superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. The left-sided
 transvenous pacemaker is redemonstrated with leads ending in appropriate
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Worsening asymmetric pulmonary vascular congestion, right worse than left,
 on the background of mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Poor aeration of the left lower lung and retrocardiac opacities are likely
 a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. However superimposed
 infectious/inflammatory process cannot be excluded.
