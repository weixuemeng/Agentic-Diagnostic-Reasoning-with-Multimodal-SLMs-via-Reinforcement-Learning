                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and
 crackles.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pectoral pacemaker leads end in the expected locations of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild opacity in the right mid lung is new
 from ___ and may represent developing infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  Heart size is
 normal.  The aorta appears slightly larger than in ___, which probably due to
 patient rotation.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting at the left
 costophrenic sulcus is similar to the prior study.  In the left lower lung, a
 1.8cm nodular opacity likely representing callus formation at a healing rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right mid lung opacity may represent early infection. Recommend repeat
 radiograph after treatment to document resolution.
 2.  Left lower lung nodule is probably callus formation at a healing rib
 fracture. Recommend shallow obliques for confirmation.
 3.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
 
 Discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:07am ___.
