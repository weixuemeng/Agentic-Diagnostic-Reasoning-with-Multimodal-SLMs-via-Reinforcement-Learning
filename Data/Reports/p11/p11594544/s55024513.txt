 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure and fevers, concern for pneumonia,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal improvement of the transparency at the level of the
 retrocardiac lung areas, likely reflecting decreased left effusion.  On the
 right, the effusion is also minimally decreased.  No new parenchymal
 opacities.  No signs of overt pulmonary edema.  Unchanged appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette.
