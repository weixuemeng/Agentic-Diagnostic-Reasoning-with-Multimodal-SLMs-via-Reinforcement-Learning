 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes.  Status post sternotomy, the alignment of the
 sternal wires is unremarkable.  Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  In addition, there is an increase in interstitial structures,
 notably in the subpleural lung areas, resembling Kerley B lines and does
 potentially reflecting mild chronic interstitial fluid overload.  This would
 be consistent with the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette.
 
 No evidence for infectious disease.  No pleural effusions.  Normal hilar
 structures.
