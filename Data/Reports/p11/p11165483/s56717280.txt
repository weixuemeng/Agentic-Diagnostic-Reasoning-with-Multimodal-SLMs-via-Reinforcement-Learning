                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size remains
 moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  There is mild chronic interstitial abnormality, similar compared
 to the prior exam.  Emphysematous changes are most pronounced within the right
 lung apex.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sulci posteriorly on the
 lateral view likely reflects chronic pleural thickening.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is present.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 There is scarring within the lung apices.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild chronic interstitial abnormality suggestive of an underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease and emphysema.  No new focal consolidation
 identified.
