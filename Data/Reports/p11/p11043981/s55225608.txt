                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 any other acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS: Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is redemonstrated. 
 There is mild interval increase of layering left pleural effusion. A small
 right pleural effusion is also present. Increased interstitial markings and
 upper vascular redistribution are seen. No convincing signs of pneumonia. 
 Cardiac contour cannot be assessed due to obscuration of the left heart border
 but appears stable.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 redemonstrated.  Degenerative changes of the right shoulder are also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Interstitial edema and increased left sided pleural effusion
 suggest heart failure.
