                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a postop fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph ___:
 
 Prior chest radiographs really not comparable, and a torso CT including the
 chest on ___ does not really clarify several abnormalities seen on
 today's chest radiographs:
 
 13 mm wide elliptical nodule could be the right nipple, right fifth anterior
 interspace, and a small almost nodular region of possible retrosternal
 consolidation seen only on the lateral.  Combination of spinal osteophytes
 lends increased radiodensity to the lower thoracic spine a region where one
 usually looks for subtle pneumonia.  Given the paucity of these findings, I
 doubt that the patient has symptomatic pneumonia, but I would strongly
 recommend chest CT scanning to see if any of the abnormalities seen on the
 conventional chest radiographs is a clinically significant one, and a change
 since ___.
 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not enlarged.  Mediastinal contour in the region of the AP window is mildly
 lobulated and could ___ adenopathy.
