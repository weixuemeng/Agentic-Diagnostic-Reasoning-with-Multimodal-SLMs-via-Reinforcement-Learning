                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post right thoracoplasty procedure, similar in appearance compared
 to the prior study.  There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle and a small underlying pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is
 increased left base opacity which could be due to infection and/or aspiration.
 Chain sutures are again seen projecting over the left mid hemithorax
 consistent with previous wedge resections.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to
 underlying pleural effusion.  Increased left mid to lower lung opacity raises
 concern for overlying infection.
