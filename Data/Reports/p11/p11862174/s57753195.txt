                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right thoracoplasty procedure. 
 Endotracheal tube has been removed in the interval.  Lung volume on the left
 is improved compared to the previous study with associated improved aeration
 at left lung base.  Multiple surgical chain sutures are present on the left,
 consistent with previous wedge resection procedures.  Residual patchy opacity
 adjacent to left heart border may reflect patchy atelectasis and less likely
 focal infection.  Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
