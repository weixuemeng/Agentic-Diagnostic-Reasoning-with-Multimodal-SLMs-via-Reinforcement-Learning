 Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right as before.  Cardiac size cannot
 be evaluated.  Peripheral opacities in the left lung are consistent with
 postoperative changes with a small amount of fluid collection surrounding
 cervical chains, better seen in prior CT from ___.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has decreased.
