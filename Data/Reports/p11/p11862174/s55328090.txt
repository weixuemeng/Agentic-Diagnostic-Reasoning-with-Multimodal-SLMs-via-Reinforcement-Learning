                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post craniotomy for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple radiographs ranging from ___ through ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient is status post a right pneumonectomy with chronic pleural
 calcifications.  The heart border cannot be accurately assessed due to
 obliteration of the right heart border.  There is persistent blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle which correlates to mediastinal fat on prior CT. 
 Persistent atelectatic changes present in the left lung base.  Multiple
 left-sided nodules are below the resolution of chest radiography and are
 better evaluated on CT.  Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Left basal atelectasis.
