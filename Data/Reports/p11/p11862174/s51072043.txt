                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is unchanged deformity of the right hemithorax with volume
 loss and diffuse calcification, likely related to prior pneumonectomy.  Suture
 chain material projecting over the left mid hemithorax is consistent with
 prior wedge resections.  There is increased opacification at the left lung
 base silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and the left heart border with an
 apparent meniscus compatible with a small left pleural effusion, increased
 from the prior studies.  Patchy airspace opacities in the upper and mid lung
 zones most likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and
 pneumonia.  There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, increased from
 the most recent prior study.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to appreciate but overall unchanged. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Increased size of small left pleural effusion with pattern in the left lung
 most compatible with a combination of atelectasis, edema and pneumonia.
