                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal interstitial
 opacity within the lung bases may reflect chronic changes and/or subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is again
 seen.  Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Mildly increased interstitial
 markings within the lung bases could reflect chronic changes and/or
 atelectasis.
