                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Heart size is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Interstitial opacities within the lung bases are
 compatible with chronic fibrotic changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine
 is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial abnormality most pronounced at the lung
 bases.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise seen.
