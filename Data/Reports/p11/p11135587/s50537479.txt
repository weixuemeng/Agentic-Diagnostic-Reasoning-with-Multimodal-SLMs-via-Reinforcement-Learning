                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of interstitial lung disease and
 two days of shortness of breath following surgery.  Evaluate for
 consolidations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax
 or focal airspace consolidation.  An S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine
 is again appreciated.  The heart size is enlarged, but unchanged.  Mild
 prominence of the basilar interstitium may relate to underlying chronic lung
 disease.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged cardiomegaly without an acute intrathoracic process.
