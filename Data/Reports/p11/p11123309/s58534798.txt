                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Epilepsy, intubated  // Confirm ETT
 placement. Assess for aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present --___ tip lies in satisfactory position approximately
 3.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present --___ tip overlies the gastric
 fundus. A left subclavian central line is present --___ tip lies at the
 expected site of confluence with the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 There is background hyperinflation suggestive of COPD. There is probable mild
 cardiomegaly, not significantly changed. There is increased retrocardiac
 density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There
 is probable left-sided volume loss, as the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 shifted to the left. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 There is atelectasis at the right lung base. Possibility of changes due to
 aspiration would be difficult to exclude in this setting. No gross effusion.
 No pneumothorax detected. Density seen in the left upper zone are probably
 related to overlying materials.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip 3.2 cm above the carina.
 2. NG tube tip over gastric fundus.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with apparent leftward shift
 of the mediastinum.
 4. Patchy opacity right base, likely atelectasis. However, it is there
 clinical concern for aspiration?
