                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cath with fever, leukocytosis  // any
 evidence of infection?      any evidence of infection?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is at the
 upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the aorta.  There
 is minimal asymmetry of opacification at the left base, though this most
 likely represents atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 the possibility of superimposed pneumonia could be considered, especially in
 the absence of a lateral view.
