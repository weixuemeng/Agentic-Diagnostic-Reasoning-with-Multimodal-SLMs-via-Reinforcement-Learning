 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, resolving septic shock, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the lung
 parenchyma and of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The only new component
 of the film are newly appeared bilateral pleural effusions.  These effusions
 are better assessed on the lateral than on the frontal image.  The effusions
 are overall mild to moderate and are restricted to the area of the
 costophrenic sinuses.  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  No new
 infectious or edematous changes.
