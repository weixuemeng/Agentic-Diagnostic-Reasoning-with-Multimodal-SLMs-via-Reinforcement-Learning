 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:22 PM
  ETT tip 1.5 cm from the carina is a little low - consider retracting.  Right
  IJ central venous catheter tip in the proximal right atrium.  Intra-aortic
  balloon pump in expected location in the descending thoracic aorta.  Temporary
  pacer wire is seen coursing from the pelvic region, likely through femoral
  placement.  D/w Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 7:15pm on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:27 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with overdose and subsequent cardiogenic shock.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 15 mm from the carina.  It could
 be withdrawn another 15 mm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation.  Upper
 enteric drainage tube ends in the proximal duodenum, traversing a
 non-distended stomach.  An ascending pacer lead ends in the mid body of the
 right ventricle.  Intra-aortic balloon pump tip is in standard position above
 the upper margin of the left main bronchus.  Right jugular line ends close to
 the superior cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax or appreciable
 pleural effusion.  Heart is moderately enlarged.  A bulge in the mediastinal
 contour could be an enlarged main pulmonary artery or alternatively aortic
 aneurysm.  Atelectasis in the right middle lobe, probably explains the
 wedge-shaped opacity projecting laterally from the right hilus.  Lung volumes
 are so low that it is difficult to say whether interstitial edema is present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
