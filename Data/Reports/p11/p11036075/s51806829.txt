 Aeration of the lungs is improved.  Pulmonary edema is decreased, though
 remains mild.  Bilateral pleural effusions also appear decreased.  Asymmetric
 opacification of the right lung base may be due to asymmetric mild edema,
 though follow-up is recommended.

 lobe opacity may be due to edema, though follow-up radiograph is recommended
 to ensure resolution.
