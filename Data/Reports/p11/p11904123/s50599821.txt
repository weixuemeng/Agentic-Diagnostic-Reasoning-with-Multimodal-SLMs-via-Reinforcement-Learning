 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The descending aorta shows mild
 unfolding.  The arch is again partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  A streaky left infrahilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
