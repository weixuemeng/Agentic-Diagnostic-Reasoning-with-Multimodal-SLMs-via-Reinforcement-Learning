                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain on chemotherapy.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT chest performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Slight blunting of
 lateral and posterior costophrenic sulci on the left suggests the possibility
 of a trace effusion.  The right costophrenic sulci appear sharp.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Predominantly sporadic widespread but bony metastases are
 present, noting lysis and a soft tissue mass along the course of the
 anterolateral course of the left fourth rib, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Widespread skeletal metastases.
