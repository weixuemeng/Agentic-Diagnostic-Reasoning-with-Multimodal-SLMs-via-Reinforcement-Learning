  ET tube in satisfactory position terminating in the mid trachea. The Swan-Ganz
  has been removed. The right IJ CV line, left chest tube, and mediastinal drain
  are in unchanged positions. There has been interval development of a opacity
  at the left lung base which likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and
  pleural effusion, although a superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There
  is slight interval improvement in the interstitial edema. The heart remains
  moderately enlarged. There is no pneumothorax.
