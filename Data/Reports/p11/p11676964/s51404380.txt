                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously present right upper lobe collapse has resolved.  Support
 and monitoring devices are in standard position except for nasogastric tube,
 with tip just below the diaphragm and side port several centimeters above the
 GE junction.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent layering right pleural
 effusion.
