                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left PICC with clinical concern for change in position, here to
 evaluate PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Fluoroscopic spot images
 from tunneled dialysis line placement dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter
 with the tip terminating in the low right atrium.  A left PICC has been
 slightly retracted with the tip now terminating at the level of the carina in
 the mid SVC.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The inspiratory
 lung volumes remain extremely low.  There is increased opacification of the
 right lung base in comparison to the most recent prior study likely reflecting
 a combination of increased pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  Left
 basilar atelectasis is unchanged.  A small left pleural effusion is also noted
 with slightly increased left basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to
 bibasilar opacification but is likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left PICC minimally retracted in comparison to ___ with tip still in
 mid SVC.
 2.  Interval placement of right HD catheter with tip in low right atrium.
 3.  Increased opacification of the bilateral bases on the right greater than
 the left likely reflecting increased pleural effusion and underlying
 atelectasis.
