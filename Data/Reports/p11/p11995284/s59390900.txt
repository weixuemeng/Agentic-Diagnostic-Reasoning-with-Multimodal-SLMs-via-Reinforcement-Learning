 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dilated bowel loops and nausea, now
 status post NG tube placement, check position.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The patient is status post sternotomy, evidence of previous bypass
 surgery.  Previously identified right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged
 position.  A thinly outlined NG tube can be identified and confirmed on
 high-contrast copy.  Identifies the NG tube to reach well into the fundus of
 the stomach pointing cranially in direction of the diaphragm.  As commented on
 the requisition, there are markedly gas-distended small and large bowels in
 this patient's abdominal condition.  The lung fields do not disclose any new
 acute pulmonary abnormalities and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube identified to reach well into stomach, no pneumothorax or
 any other acute pulmonary abnormalities can be identified on this portable
 single view examination.
