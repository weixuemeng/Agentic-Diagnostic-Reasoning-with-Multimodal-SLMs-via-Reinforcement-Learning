                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiograph from one hour before on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again low lung volumes contribute to bibasilar opacities which
 could be atelectasis, but certainly pneumonia should be considered.  Right IJ
 line terminates in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires,
 mediastinal clips, and cardiac silhouette are all stable. Possible small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present. Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures persists, and mild pulmonary vascular engorgement may be present.
 Patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ placement without evidence of pneumothorax,
 terminating in the low SVC.  Bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia
 versus atelectasis.
