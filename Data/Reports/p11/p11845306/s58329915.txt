                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx of endocarditis with hypoxia and crackles at
 bases bilaterally.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and partly
 calcified.  There are probably trace pleural effusions bilaterally.  Fissures
 are mildly thickened.  Diffuse hazy opacification of each lung with a
 widespread reticular abnormality and bilaterally hilar enlargement suggests
 pulmonary edema.  Findings are slightly more extensive in the right lung than
 left but largely symmetric.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread airspace disease suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.
