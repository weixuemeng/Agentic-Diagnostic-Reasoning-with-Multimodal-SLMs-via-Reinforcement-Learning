                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with ams.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent lucency along the anterior mediastinum, best seen on lateral
 radiograph with absence of lung markings is consistent with artifact due to
 over penetration.  The lungs are well inflated and clear.  No pleural
 effusion.  No apical pneumothorax.  Extensive aortic arch calcifications are
 noted.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures demonstrates mild multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine as well as levoscoliosis of
 the lumbar spine centered at L2-L3.  Again seen are clips in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically no pneumonia.
