 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and
 tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  Low lung
 volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt
 pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Mild atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  Degenerative changes
 are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
