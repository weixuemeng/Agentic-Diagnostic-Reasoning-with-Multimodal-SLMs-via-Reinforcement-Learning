                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent pneumonia seen at ___ and
 inpatient overnight at ___.  // is his pneumonia resolved?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are several bilateral upper paraspinal surgical clips.  Faint amorphous
 calcifications projecting over the lateral left mid lung likely reflect a
 calcified pleural plaque.
 
 The lungs otherwise clear.  Previous bilateral lower lung opacities are
 significantly improved, however there is persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
 Heart size is normal.  Image somewhat contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous bilateral lower lung opacities are significantly improved with some
 residual opacity especially in the left retrocardiac region suggesting
 incomplete resolution of pneumonia.
