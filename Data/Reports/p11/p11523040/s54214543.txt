                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postoperative clips are seen in the superior mediastinum.  There is patchy
 density in the left lower lobe and perihilar region.  There is also a small
 area of patchy density in the right lower lobe.  This is presumably acute,
 this could be related to scarring and correlation with earlier studies would
 be helpful if available.
 There is no pneumothorax, effusion or CHF.
 Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
