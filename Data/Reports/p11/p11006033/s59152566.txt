                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso performed on ___ and chest
 radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show stable dense
 calcifications within the left humeral head consistent with bone infarction or
 less likely a calcified enchondroma also seen on prior CT.  Kyphosis and mild
 degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic spine.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits with an unfolded thoracic aorta and mild tortuosity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 1)  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 2)  Stable appearance of
 left humeral head bone infarction or less likely calcified enchondroma.
