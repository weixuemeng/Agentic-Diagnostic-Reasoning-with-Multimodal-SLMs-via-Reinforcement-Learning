 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fractures, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mild pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 pre-existing blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is no longer visible,
 given better ventilation of the lung bases.  No interval appearance of focal
 parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.
