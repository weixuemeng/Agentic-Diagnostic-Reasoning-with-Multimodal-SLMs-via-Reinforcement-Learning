 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  C1 and T12 fractures, assessment for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are still in situ.  In the
 interval, the patient has received vertebral fixation devices.  There are
 areas of atelectasis and a questionable small left pleural effusion.  Minimal
 fluid overload, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
