                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diastolic HF, altered mental status  //
 please evaluate for effusion, edema, opacities
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Interval worsening of left basilar opacification
 is probably due to atelectasis, although aspiration and developing infectious
 pneumonia are also possible.  Small left pleural effusion is also
 demonstrated.
