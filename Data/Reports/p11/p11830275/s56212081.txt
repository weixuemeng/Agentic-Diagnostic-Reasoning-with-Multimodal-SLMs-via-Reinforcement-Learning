                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia.  // assess for infiltrate, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
 crowding.  There is mild engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature as well as
 bilateral, basilar opacities consistent with atelectasis and possibly mild
 pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral, subtle opacities left greater than right
 consistent with atelectasis, pneumonia is less likely. Possible mild edema.
