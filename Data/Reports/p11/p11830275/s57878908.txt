 INDICATION:  History of fall with fracture of C1, C7, T1 and T12 thoracic
 vertebrae, dyspnea, to evaluate for fluid overload.

 widened mediastinum likely from mediastinal congestion has improved. 
 Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is
 better since last 24 hours. Mild to moderately enlarged heart is similar. No
 new discrete lung opacities of concern.  Pleural effusion is small on the left
