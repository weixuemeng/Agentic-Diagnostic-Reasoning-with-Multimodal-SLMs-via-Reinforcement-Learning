 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:59
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post fall with cervical and thoracic
 fractures, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:40
 a.m.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 6:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval improvement in overall aeration with persistent
 retrocardiac consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base.  These
 findings most likely reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis although bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is some mild vascular congestion but with
 a suggestion of mild pulmonary edema on the current examination.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Spinal hardware is seen overlying the lower thoracic spine.
