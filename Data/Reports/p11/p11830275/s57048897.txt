                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma, fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Overlying trauma board slightly limits
 evaluation.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.5 cm from the
 carina, and nasogastric tube tip courses through the stomach, off the inferior
 borders of the film.  There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine
 technique and low lung volumes.  Ill-defined opacities within the left upper
 and both lower lung fields may atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax is seen. 
 There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  There is mild irregularity of the
 right seventh rib laterally, and fracture in this region is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard positioning of lines and tubes.
 2.  Low lung volumes with left upper lung and bibasilar opacification,
 possibly representing atelectasis. Possible small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Superior mediastinal widening may be due to low lung volumes and supine
 positioning though a chest CTA can be performed for further evaluation if
 there is concern for mediastinal injury.
 4.  Irregularity of the right seventh rib laterally and a fracture in this
 region is not excluded.
