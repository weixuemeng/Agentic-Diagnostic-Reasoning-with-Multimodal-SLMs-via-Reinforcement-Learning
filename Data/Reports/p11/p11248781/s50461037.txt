  No evidence of acute disease.  Nodular focus in the left lower hemithorax,
  nipple shadow versus true pulmonary nodule of substantial size; suggest PA
  view with nipple markers when appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a nodular focus measuring up to 11 mm which projects along the left
 lower lung, possibly a nipple shadow but potentially a true pulmonary nodule
 of substantial size.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular focus projecting over the left lower lung, possibly a
 nipple shadow.  When clinically appropriate, a repeat PA view with nipple
 markers is recommended to assess further.  A true pulmonary nodule of
 substantial size is an additional possibility, however, which should be
 excluded.
