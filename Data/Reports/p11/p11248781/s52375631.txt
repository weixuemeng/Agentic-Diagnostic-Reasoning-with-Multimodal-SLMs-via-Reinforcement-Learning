                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest x-rays with nipple marker to evaluate yesterday's lung
 abnormality.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were performed with a nipple maker.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Review of standard PA and lateral chest views with nipple markers did not
 demonstrate apparent ___-mm nodule in the left lower lobe on yesterdays chest
 radiograph. Although this nodular opacity did not correspond to nipple shadow,
 based on repeat standard views, possibility of lung nodule cannnot be
 confidently ruled out, since it may be obscured by the soft tissue and  bone
 structure. For further evaluation, I recommend shallow oblique views (maximum
 8 degrees).
