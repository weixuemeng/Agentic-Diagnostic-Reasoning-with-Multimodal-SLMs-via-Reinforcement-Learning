                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CTA chest with and without contrast and reconstruction dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is left chest tube, which appears unchanged in location in comparison to
 the prior chest radiograph, without evidence of pneumothorax.  There is
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms and increased AP diameter representing
 hyperinflation.  There is silhouetting of the left heart border, which has
 improved in comparison to the prior chest radiograph, and likely represents
 underlying mass with lymphangitic carcinomatosis, noted on the prior CT. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left chest tube in appropriate position without pneumothorax.
 2.  Improving opacification of the left heart border representing underlying
 mass with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
 3.  Hyperinflation.
