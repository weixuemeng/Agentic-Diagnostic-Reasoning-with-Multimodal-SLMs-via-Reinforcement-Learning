                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 COMPARISON:   CT chest dated ___ from an outside facility.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis,
 increased in size from the prior CT.  The effusion obscures the known mass in
 ground-glass opacities in the left lower lung demonstrated on prior CT. 
 Increased asymmetric opacity in the left perihilar region is concerning for
 lymphangitic tumor spread in the setting of the known mass and less likely
 reflects pneumonia or a component of edema.  The heart is probably mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Opacity in the left upper lobe and
 right upper lobe on prior CT are not readily apparent on radiograph today.  No
 pneumothorax.  Aortic knob calcifications are noted.  Degenerative changes of
 thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in moderate left pleural effusion atelectasis with increased
 left perihilar opacity concerning for lymphangitic spread.
