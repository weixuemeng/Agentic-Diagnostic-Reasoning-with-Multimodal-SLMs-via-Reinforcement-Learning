                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluate chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable supine AP view of the chest.  An overlying pad
 obscures the left heart border and left lower lung.  There are diffuse patchy
 opacifications in both lungs.  The left upper lobe has a more dense
 opacification.  Heart size appears slightly enlarged.  No right pleural
 effusion is seen.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured by overlying pad.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 2 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube ends in the
 stomach.  There is no evidence of free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral opacities most consistent with pulmonary edema
 however hemorrhage or conosoidation cannot be entirely ruled out.
