                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 08:08
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress, PEA arrest. 
 Check endotracheal tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:14.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright chest film, ___ at 8:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the
 proximal right atrium.  An endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  There are layering effusions, left much greater than right,
 and the pulmonary vasculature appears ill-defined, which likely reflects an
 element of superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  More patchy opacity in the
 right mid lung and in the left lower lobe could reflect compressive
 atelectasis, although a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
