                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with AFib and RVR, status post PEA arrest. 
 Now on cooling protocol.  Evaluation for presence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of  the chest from same day,
 five hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal supine radiograph of the chest again demonstrates variable
 intensity of bilateral consolidations with interval improvement of the left
 upper lung and possible slight worsening of the right lower lung compared to
 the previous study.  There has been no change in position of the previously
 seen support devices.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral consolidations are again seen, and could represent
 pneumonia with some interval improvement of the left upper lung and slight
 worsening of the right lower lung since the prior study.
