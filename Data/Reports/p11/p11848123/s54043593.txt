                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Subcutaneous emphysema has developed in the right supraclavicular region, and
 there is a suggestion of pneumomediastinum.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 otherwise stable in appearance since the prior study.  Improving areas of
 atelectasis are present in the right perihilar and left retrocardiac regions. 
 No definite pneumothorax is identified, but overlying external devices
 potentially obscure a small pneumothorax at the apices.
