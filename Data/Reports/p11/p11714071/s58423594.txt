                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness.  Assess for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual -chamber pacemaker lead tips are in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 unchanged since prior examination.
 
 Lungs are clear except for a patchy left retrocardiac opacity obscuring the
 medial left hemidiaphragm and a portion of the descending thoracic aortic
 interface.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left retrocardiac opacity could potentially represent an early focus of
 pneumonia, localized aspiration or atelectasis.
