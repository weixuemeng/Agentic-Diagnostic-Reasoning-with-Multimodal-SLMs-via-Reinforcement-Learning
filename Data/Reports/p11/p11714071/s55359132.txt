 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with chest pain.  To evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 There is some cardiomegaly present.  Mild unfolding of both the ascending and
 descending thoracic aorta is present.  There is some patchy linear change in
 the left base, likely atelectasis, but new from prior study.  No good evidence
 of significant congestive changes.  The visualized osseous structures are
 grossly normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 No definitive pneumonia.  Changes in the left base, although new are likely
 suggestive of atelectasis.
