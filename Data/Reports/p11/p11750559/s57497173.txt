                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M PMHx significant for diaphragmatic paralysis c/b
 respiratory failure s/p trach now s/p trach exchange ___ trach change and
 bronch  // assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The diameter of the tracheostomy tube cuff is consistently greater than the
 expected diameter of the trachea, suggesting tracheomalacia.  Right PICC ends
 in the low SVC.  NG tube in the decompressed stomach.
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemithorax due to left lung collapse is
 unchanged since at least ___ and has occurred previously.  The left
 margins of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are obscured and the volume of any
 left pleural effusion is indeterminate.  A small right pleural effusion is new
 or increased.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tracheostomy with hyperexpanded cuff, likely due to tracheomalacia.
 2. Appropriate positioning of right PICC and NG tube.
 3. Persistent left lung collapse.  Chronic severely elevated left
 hemidiaphragm is probably paralyzed or extremely eventrated.
 4. Small right pleural effusion.
