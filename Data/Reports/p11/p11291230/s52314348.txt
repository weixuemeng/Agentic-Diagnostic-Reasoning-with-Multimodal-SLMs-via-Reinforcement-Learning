                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CVL placement, pacer wire placement, failed L-subclavian
 attempt  // evaluate CVL placement, ET tube placement, L-pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___ at 02:04 and 00:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New endotracheal tube is in standard placement, 5 cm above the carina. A new,
 temporary right internal jugular pacer tip projects over the right ventricle. 
 Central consolidation in the right lung has increased dramatically, and there
 is little consolidation in the left lung, although there has been an increase
 in vascular congestion in the suprahilar left lung. Heart size is normal and
 any pleural effusion is minimal. If the right lung findings are due to
 pulmonary edema if it is extremely asymmetric. Therefore worsening pneumonia
 and pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right lung consolidation markedly increased from the prior study done at
 02:04, could be unusually asymmetric pulmonary edema or worsening pneumonia or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.
 2. Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina and a right internal
 jugular pacer is seen with its tip projected over the right ventricle.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Hemorrahge pna or asymtettic edeam
