                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with syncope, R-rib pain  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 00:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits. Hazy bilateral opacities (right greater than left) are new from
 the prior exam done at 00:47. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral hilar opacities (right greater than left) could represent mild
 pulmonary edema, new from the study done at 00:47.  Given that the opacity is
 asymmetrically larger on the right, consideration should be given to the
 possibility of infection.
