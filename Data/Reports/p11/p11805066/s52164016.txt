 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 05:17.

 left lower lobe atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax.  No fractures.

 rather than pneumonia.
 
 2.  Worsening bilateral pleural effusion and persistent left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 3.  Monitoring and support devices are all unchanged.
