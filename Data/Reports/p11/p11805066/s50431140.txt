                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman without significant PMH who presents with a new
 RUL lung mass of undifferentiated large cell carcinoma, with airway compromise
 and SVC syndrome now s/p 5 cycles XRT, tracheostomy ___, RMSB and LMSB
 stenting, abx for PNA (never had full course for HACP given low clinical
 concern) and will pursue palliative chemotherapy as an outpatient.  // Stent
 Migration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tubes, chest tube, gastrostomy tube, and the bilateral
 bronchial stents are unchanged.  There is complete opacification of the right
 lung, which is a progression from previous chest radiograph.  The new right
 lower lung opacification could represent increased pleural effusion and
 progression of the right lung mass with now more vertical orientation of the
 right mainstem bronchus.
 
 The left lung is clear with persistent lower lobe atelectasis and pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No bronchial stent migration.
 
 2.  Complete opacification of the right hemithorax which may represent
 progression of the right lung mass and pleural effusion.
