 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP  // Cardiomegaly? Effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  The heart appears enlarged, which
 may represent cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. There is no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, or focal consolidation.  Patchy opacity at the medial right
 base likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low volume related to
 elevated right hemidiaphragm.

 1.  The heart appears enlarged, which may represent cardiomegaly or
 pericardial effusion.
 
 2.  No evidence of pleural effusion.
