                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intra-aortic balloon pump.  Assess intra-aortic balloon
 pump placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 The IABP is unchanged in position.  The IVC catheter is stable.  Lung volumes
 are decreased which somewhat exaggerates the appearance of the small bilateral
 pleural effusions which are not appreciably changed. Bibasilar atelectasis is
 slightly worse.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. IABP unchanged in position
 
 2. Lung volumes are lower, small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged,
 and mild bibasilar atalectasis is slightly worse.
