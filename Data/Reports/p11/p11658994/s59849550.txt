                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  There is
 minimal amount of pleural effusion suspected on the lateral view, most likely
 on the right with questionable adjacent opacities that might reflect
 developing/evolving infectious process.  Given patient's history, evaluation
 in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended for
 documentation of resolution.
