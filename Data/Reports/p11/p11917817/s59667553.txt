                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The lungs are clear
 bilaterally, without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A subtle
 opacity projecting over the inferior left heart border is likely a fat pad. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Subtle opacity obscuring the
 left inferior heart border is likely a fat pad.
