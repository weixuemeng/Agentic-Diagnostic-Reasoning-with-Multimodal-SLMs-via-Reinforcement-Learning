                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New cough and wheeze.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart is enlarged.  The aorta is
 moderately calcified and tortuous.  Central pulmonary vessels are congested,
 accompanied by mild interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions,
 greater on the right.  Focal density within the right middle lobe may
 represent atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax. A lower thoracic vertebral wedge compression
 deformity is slightly progressed since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central vascular congestion with bilateral pleural effusions and
 interstitial edema.  Underlying consolidation, particulary within the right
 lower lobe, cannot be excluded. A followup chest radiograph is recommended
 following resolution of edema.
