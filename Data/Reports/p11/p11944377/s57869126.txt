 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MCC with multiple traumas  // chest tubes,
 ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been
 substantial improvement in pulmonary edema.  Multiple rib fractures and right
 clavicular fracture are unchanged.  No obvious pneumothorax.  There is
 increased bibasilar atelectasis and new, small, bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bilateral chest tubes are essentially unchanged in position.  An NG tube side
 port projects just distal to the GE junction.  An ET tube terminates 6 cm
 above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantially improved, now mild, pulmonary edema.  Supportive devices, tubes,
 and lines are appropriately positioned as described above.
