 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:26 AM
  
  
  
  Compared with the earlier chest radiograph, no significant change in the
  appearance of the lungs.  There are known bilateral pneumothoraces, as seen on
  the CT chest from the prior day.  The endotracheal tube terminates 6.1 cm
  above the carina.  Of note, the nasogastric tube sidehole terminates at the
  level of the left hemidiaphragm, and should be advanced several cm to ensure
  placement in the stomach.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures again noted, as
  well as a right clavicular fracture.  Subcutaneous emphysema is grossly
  unchanged.  Opacification of the left hemithorax, due to hemothorax is also
  unchanged.
  
  A tubular opacity projecting over the right upper lung is confirmed to be part
  of the chest tube outside the patient by the trauma ICU resident.
  
  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
  ___ at 19:00 on ___, immediately after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MCV with multiple trauma, including right PTX
 w/chest tube and left hemothorax.  // worsening oxygenation and decreased
 breath sounds, please assess for worsening pneumothorax or hemothorax   
 worsening oxygenation and decreased breath sounds, please assess for worsening
 pneumothorax or hemothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the monitoring and support devices.  The side-port of the NG
 tube again is at the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed
 forward about 5-10 cm if possible.  Multiple left rib fractures are again seen
 with little overall change in the amount of subcutaneous gas.  No large
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Basilar opacification is consistent with volume
 loss and pleural fluid, though some of this could also represent pulmonary
 contusion.
 On the right, a chest tube is in place and there is again extensive
 subcutaneous gas that is more prominent than on the opposite side and extends
 well into the neck.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.
 There is a fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle.
