                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with asthma and alcoholic pancreatitis.  Assess
 for acute pulmonary infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___, and CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is subtle increased opacity in
 the right lung base projecting over the heart on the lateral view.  Though
 possibly atelectasis, aspiration and/or pneumonia are also possible in the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.  Findings are new compared to multiple
 prior radiographs, though are of indeterminate age.  The remainder of the
 lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Rightward scoliosis of the mid thoracic spine is unchanged from
 prior, though remains severe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New subtle right middle lobe opacity, possible atelectasis,
 though aspiration or pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
