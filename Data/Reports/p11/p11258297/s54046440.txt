                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain after fall and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and a chest radiograph from same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the interstitial markings as well as peribronchial cuffing,
 particularly in the left lower lobe, could be reflective of a viral infection
 or atypical pneumonia. There are no focal consolidations. In addition, on the
 prior CT there were noted to be multiple cysts within the lung parenchyma
 which if increased in size and number could also be contributing to the
 appearance of the lungs at this time. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions. No fractures identified on this nondedicated view however there is
 a severe scoliosis which limits the overall evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Prominence of interstitial markings and peribronchial cuffing diffusely
 could reflect a viral or atypical pneumonia
 2. Numerous cysts noted on the prior CT, which could contribute to the
 interstitial abnormality on the current radiograph, particularly if these have
 increased in size and number. Would suggest a nonemergent high-resolution CT
 as an outpatient for further evaluation of this process.
 Findings posted on the ED dashboard.
