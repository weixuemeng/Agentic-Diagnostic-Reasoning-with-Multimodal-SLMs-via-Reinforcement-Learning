                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is minimal patchy opacity in the left
 lung base.  This likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacification of the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
