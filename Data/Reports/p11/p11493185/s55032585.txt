 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued bilateral
 opacifications at the bases, slightly less prominent than consistent with
 atelectasis.  Again, however, there is an area of opacification in the left

 superimposed pneumonia in this area would have to be considered.
