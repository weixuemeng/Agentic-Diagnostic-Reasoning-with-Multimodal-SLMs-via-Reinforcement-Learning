                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:11 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man fell with subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage
 and pneumothorax on the left.  Discontinued his left pleural tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 4:03 p.m.:
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion despite multiple left rib
 fractures, and a nondisplaced clavicle fracture.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 has been stable since earlier in the day when torso CT showed no mediastinal
 bleeding.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is probably due to volume
 resuscitation.  Gaseous distention of the stomach is still present.  Very
 small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral abdominal wall is
 not necessarily clinically significant.
