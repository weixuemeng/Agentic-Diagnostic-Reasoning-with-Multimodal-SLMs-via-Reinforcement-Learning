 opacifications in the left lung correspond with areas of atelectasis and
 contusion, better assessed on the concurrent CT. Endotracheal tube terminates
 at the level of the clavicles.  Nasogastric tube passes below the left
 hemidiaphragm and out of view.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Right lung is clear.
