                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post seizure with dizziness, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are well
 aerated without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal, and there is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, which
 is unexpected given the patient's age but may be due in part to AP technique. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is
 midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Top normal heart size, which is unexpected given the patient's age.  This
 may be related to AP technique.  Therefore followup with PA and lateral
 radiograph or non- urgent/outpatient echocardiogram is recommended.
