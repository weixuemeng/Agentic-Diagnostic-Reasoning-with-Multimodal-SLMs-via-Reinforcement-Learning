                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dislodged and replaced NGT  // evaluate
 NGT placement      evaluate NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the replaced nasogastric
 tube is in the mid portion of the stomach.  However, the side port is at the
 level of the esophagogastric junction so that the tube should be pushed
 forward at least 5-7 cm for better positioning.
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Prominence of interstitial
 markings at the bases with Kerley lines are consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  However, areas of possible coalescence at the
 bases could represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
