                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, hepatitis C, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Widespread bronchiectasis with diffuse bronchial wall
 thickening and interstitial abnormality appears relatively similar compared to
 the prior exams.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  No new focal
 opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread chronic bronchiectasis without new focal consolidative opacity. 
 Atypical superimposed infection however cannot be excluded on this exam.
