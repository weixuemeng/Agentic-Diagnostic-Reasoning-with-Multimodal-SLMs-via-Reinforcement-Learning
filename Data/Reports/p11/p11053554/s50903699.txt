                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulled out PICC, evaluate position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The previously seen right-sided PICC line is no longer visualized.  Again seen
 is multifocal bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and associated
 scattered nodular opacities in both lungs, indicative of small airways
 disease.  The more focal left lower lobe opacity appears improved from chest
 radiograph dated ___.  No new focal consolidations are appreciated. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of right-side PICC.
