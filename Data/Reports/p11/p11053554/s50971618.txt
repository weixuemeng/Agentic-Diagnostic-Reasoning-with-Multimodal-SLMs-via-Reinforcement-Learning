                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  Apparent
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely related to the technique.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged.
 Redemonstrated are bilateral central areas of bronchial wall thickening and
 diffuse bronchiectasis.  As compared to the prior study, increased more
 confluent opacities particularly at the right base and adjacent to the right
 heart border are concerning for infection.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia on a background of bronchiectasis.
