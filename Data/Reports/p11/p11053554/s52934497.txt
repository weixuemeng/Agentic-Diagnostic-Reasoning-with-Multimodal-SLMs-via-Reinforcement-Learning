                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and pneumonia.  History of HIV.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous PA and
 lateral films from ___, portable chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Again seen are diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings with
 bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening compatible with chronic
 underlying lung disease.  Nodular opacities in the right mid and upper lung
 are again noted and although are more conspicuous on the current exam, likely
 have not demonstrated interval change given differences in technique.  There
 is no large confluent consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral changes compatible with known bronchiectasis
 and bronchial wall thickening.  No definite superimposed acute process.
