                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___, ___, and CT
 chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Again seen is diffuse bronchial wall
 thickening, bronchial mucous impaction and bronchiectasis.  There are
 superimposed somewhat confluent opacities in bilateral lung bases and right
 upper lobe, new since prior.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild perihilar vascular congestion is likely present.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are otherwise unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New multifocal airspace opacities superimposed on chronic diffuse bronchial
 wall thickening and bronchiectasis, concerning for multifocal infection. 
 Atypical infection is a consideration given patient's HIV status.
