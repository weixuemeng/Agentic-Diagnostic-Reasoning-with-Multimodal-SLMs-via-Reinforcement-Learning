                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with worsening cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall, there is little change in comparison to the prior study.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated. Again seen is diffuse bronchiectasis, bronchial wall
 thickening and scattered interstitial opacities.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged but stable. No acute fractures identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening. A superimposed
 infection is difficult to exclude and CT may be helpful if warranted
 clinically.
