 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior,
 there has been no significant interval change.  Again seen is an upper lung
 predominant interstitial abnormality with bronchiectasis and interstitial
 opacities.  There has been no significant interval change or no new area of
 consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but similar compared to
 prior.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.

 prior.  Please note that subtle changes would be difficult to assess by plain
 film given diffuse background abnormality.
