                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___; ___ and ___; earlier chest CT from
 ___ and plain films from ___ are also available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including
 perihilar opacities.  The chest is again hyperinflated.  The lungs again show
 a heterogeneous bilateral opacification pattern with areas of bronchial wall
 thickening and bronchiectasis, most suggestive of sequelae of a chronic
 infectious process.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases have increased
 somewhat, although otherwise, the pattern appears unchanged and the change is
 mild.  There are no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected mild increase in basilar opacities.  The overall
 appearance suggests a waxing and waning chronic infection or perhaps acute
 infection superimposed upon chronic infection (for example acute pneumonia of
 superimposed on chronic atypical infection such as perhaps atypical
 mycobacterial infection).
