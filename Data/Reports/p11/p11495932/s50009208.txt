  1. Mild vascular congestion with stable moderate cardiomegaly and new small
  left pleural effusion.
  2. New left lower lobe atelectasis. Clinical correlation is recommended to
  assess for superimposed infection.
  3. Linear left midlung opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild vascular congestion is noted.  There is new elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with left lower lobe opacity most consistent with atelectasis. 
 New small left pleural effusion is present. Linear opacity along the left mid
 lung is stable since the prior examinations and most consistent with
 atelectasis.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour and hila
 are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion with stable moderate cardiomegaly and new small
 left pleural effusion.
