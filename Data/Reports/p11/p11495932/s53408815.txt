                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p OPCABG (LIMA-LAD) ___  // r/o PNA in setting of
 confusion postop
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip appears to be in
 the proximal right atrium, this could be withdrawn 3 cm to be positioned at
 the cavoatrial junction.  Moderate cardiomegaly and prominence of the
 bilateral hila is similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with a degree of
 congestive heart failure.  There is unchanged bibasal atelectasis, infection
 cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left internal jugular catheter appears to terminate in the right atrium,
 this could be withdrawn 3 cm to be positioned at the cavoatrial junction.  No
 significant interval change in the bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded.
