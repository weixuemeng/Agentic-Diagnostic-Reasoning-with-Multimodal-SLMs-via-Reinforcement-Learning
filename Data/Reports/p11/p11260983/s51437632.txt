                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with lightheadedness and weakness.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded, with no evidence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax,
 or focal airspace consolidation.  Mild interstitial prominence is chronic, and
 unchanged.  Previously demonstrated bilateral fat-containing Bochdalek hernias
 are better assessed on prior CT of the chest. The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine, with
 calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Bilateral fat-containing Bochdalek hernias, mild cardiomegaly, and chronic
 interstitial prominence are unchanged.
