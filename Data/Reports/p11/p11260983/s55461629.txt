                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well expanded.  An eventration of the right hemidiaphragm
 is better seen in the lateral view.  Also in the lateral view, there is a
 triangular opacity obscuring the posterior right costophrenic sulcus and
 silhouetting out the posterior margin of the right hemidiaphragm which
 corresponds to a fat containing Bochdalek hernia better characterized in prior
 chest CT. Linear opacities along the left lung base are compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis. Otherwise, no other focal parenchymal opacities are
 identified.  
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine with calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament are
 present.  Cardiac size is normal.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm and posterior right-sided Bochdalek's hernia are better
 characterized in prior chest CT. Left basilar atelectasis.
