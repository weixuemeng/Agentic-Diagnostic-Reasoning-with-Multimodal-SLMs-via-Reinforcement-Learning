 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:03 AM
  .  Patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects an area of atelectasis. 
  There is a possible lucency at the left apex which could reflect a tiny
  pneumothorax.  Followup imaging would be recommended.  Prominent calcification
  of the left first costochondral junction is again noted.  No evidence of
  pulmonary edema.
  
  
  Status post placement of pacemaker, with leads ending in the right atrium and
  right ventricle.  Possible trace left apical pneumothorax.  If concern remains
  for pneumothorax, recommend repeat radiograph with better inspiratory effort
  and patient positioning.
  
  Wet read was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 20:15
  on ___, at the time of discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sinus node dysfunction s/p PPM  // rule out
 pneumothorax, lead placement      rule out pneumothorax, lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 19:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a dual lead left-sided pacer with the leads terminating
 over the expected location the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.
 There is crowding of the vasculature given the low lung volumes.  Patchy
 opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis.  Linear lucency at the
 left apex could reflect a tiny pneumothorax.  Followup imaging should be
 considered.  Heart remains stably enlarged.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Prominent calcification of the left first costochondral junction unchanged.
