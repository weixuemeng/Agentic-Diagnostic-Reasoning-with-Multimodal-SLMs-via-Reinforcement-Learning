                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  After VATS.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Left pleural drain has been repositioned in the left lower hemithorax superior
 to its previous location.  There is no appreciable left pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion, but there is still substantial subcutaneous emphysema in the
 left flank and increasing in the left neck.  Lungs are clear, though low in
 volume.  Heart size is exaggerated by elevated diaphragm but probably not
 enlarged and there is no pulmonary edema.
