                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of left-sided chest tube, a small left
 apicolateral pneumothorax is similar in size to the previous study.  A basilar
 component of the pneumothorax is minimally increased, however.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema in the left supraclavicular region and left chest wall are again
 demonstrated, and there is also a suggestion of pneumomediastinum. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Improving atelectasis in
 the left lung base.  Rounded opacity is seen posteriorly overlying the mid
 thoracic spine on the lateral radiograph, without a clear correlate on recent
 CT of ___.  This may represent a loculated area of pleural fluid,
 and short-term followup radiograph may be helpful for resolution.  Surgical
 clips are present in the left juxtahilar region, consistent with recent
 surgery.
