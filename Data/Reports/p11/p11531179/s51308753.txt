                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobectomy for cancer, now with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post left lower lobectomy with clips noted in the left
 juxtahilar region.  Leftward shift of mediastinal structures is re-
 demonstrated.  Opacity within the left lung base likely reflects a combination
 of small pleural fluid as well as likely atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.  No pulmonary edema is present, in the right lung is
 clear.  No pneumothorax is clearly evident.  Subcutaneous gas within the left
 chest wall extending into the neck has decreased in the interval.  Rounded
 opacity posteriorly overlying the mid thoracic spine is re- demonstrated,
 which again may reflect loculated pleural fluid.  Mild degenerative changes
 are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent opacity within the left lung base, likely reflecting a combination
 of small pleural effusion and atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.
