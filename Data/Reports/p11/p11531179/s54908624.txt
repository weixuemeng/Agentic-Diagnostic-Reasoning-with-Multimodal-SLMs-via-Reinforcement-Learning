                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 18:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left chest wall wound exploration and
 drain, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable upright chest film ___ at 18:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain diminished with the right lung being grossly clear. 
 There is opacity at the left base in the region of known wound where there is
 now a presence of a surgical drain.  There is likely a left effusion, and the
 adjacent lung at the left base is likely atelectatic.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  The left heart border is obscured,
 limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, but they are
 likely unchanged.
