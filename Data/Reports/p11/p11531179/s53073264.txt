 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post left thoracotomy with chest tube.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 Increasing pulmonary opacification in the left mid and lower zones is present.
 In the absence of similar changes on the right or significant effusions, it is
 probable that this represents evidence of aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is present.
