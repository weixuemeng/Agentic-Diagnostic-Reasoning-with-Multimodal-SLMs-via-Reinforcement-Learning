                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient post-bronchial thermoplasty.  Check for
 infiltration and/or pneumothorax.  Study # ___, ___ # ___, do
 not charge patient.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  External EKG cables are overlying the chest.  High
 positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort with somewhat crowded
 appearance of pulmonary vasculature on the bases and inability to identify
 entire heart configuration.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions as the
 lateral pleural sinuses are free and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical
 area.  No evidence of acute infiltrates and thus can be excluded on a single
 portable chest view.  When comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination ___ ___, chest findings were quite normal.
