                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, intubated.  Assess for pneumonia and tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph.  Nasogastric tube courses into the
 stomach.  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm above the carina and should not
 be advanced any further. While it is likely in satisfactory position, it is
 difficult to ascertain on this image if the head is flexed or extended.  
 
 The lungs are slightly low in volume.  Multifocal interstitial and parenchymal
 abnormalities are nonspecific and could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema
 with a slight left-sided predominance. Fullness of the AP window and hila may
 reflect coexistent adenopathy, which could be confirmed with post-treatment
 radiographs.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 enlarged, particularly the left atrium given splaying of the carina. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Multifocal interstitial and parenchymal abnormality may reflect asymmetric
 edema 
 2. ET tube is 1.9 cm above the carina and should not be advanced further;
 though the exact tube position is uncertain given unclear head position. 
 3. Fullness of hila and AP window can be reassessed after treatment.
