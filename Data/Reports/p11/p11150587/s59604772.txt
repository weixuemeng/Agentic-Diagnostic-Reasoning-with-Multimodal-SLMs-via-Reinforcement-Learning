                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Improving hypoxemia.  Assess for resolving atelectasis and
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Decreased lung volumes are noted.  Compared with the most recent exam, there
 has been interval re-expansion of the right upper lobe.  Redemonstrated are
 small, bilateral pleural effusions. There is no focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  The heart size is at the upper
 end of normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  The degree of
 pneumoperitoneum is now somewhat decreased as compared to the last several
 examinations. Redemonstrated are several large, branching metallic foci seen
 in the lower left lobe, of dubious clinical significance. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval re-expansion of the right upper lobe.
 
 2. Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3. Interval decrease in the size of the patient's pneumoperitoneum.
