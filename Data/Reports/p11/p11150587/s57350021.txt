                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable view of the chest:  Extensive opacification of the right hemi
 thorax the combination of atelectasis, particularly of the right upper lobe,
 as well as a moderate-sized pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis
 as well.  The mediastinum is shifted to the right owing to the atelectasis. 
 The left lung by comparison is essentially clear aside from minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Heart size is probably within normal limits. 
 
 The large amount of free intra-abdominal air is similar in quantity to 4 days
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right upper lobe collapse 
 
 2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. 
 
 3. Large amount of intra-abdominal free air, more than would be expected 5
 days after surgery.
