 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominent bilateral interstitial markings most notably at the lung bases are
 unchanged since the study of 2 days ago, and are likely due to emphysema which
 was partially imaged on the recent cervical spine CT. There is no new
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are
 within normal limits. Regional bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.

 Emphysema with no acute process.
