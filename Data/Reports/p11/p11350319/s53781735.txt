                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia and missed dialysis
 yesterday.  Question pneumonia are fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 0:46.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP view of the chest.  There are increased perihilar and bibasilar
 opacities suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  This has progressed even
 despite lower lung volumes on the current exam.  Mild blunting of the right
 lateral costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis versus small effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Dual lumen central venous catheter
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Perihilar and bibasilar opacities most suggestive of pulmonary edema
 especially given rapid onset since the exam from earlier the same day.
