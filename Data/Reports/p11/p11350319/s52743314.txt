                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single view chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There are patchy
 opacities throughout the lungs, particularly in the perihilar and bibasilar
 regions, suggestive of pulmonary edema.  There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small effusion.  A right-sided subclavian
 dual-lumen catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava and right
 atrium.  Sternotomy wires are in place.  Multiple surgical clips project over
 the mediastinum and right upper quadrant.  No acute bony abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy pulmonary opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema. 
 However, underlying infection cannot be excluded based on this radiographic
 appearance.
