                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with interval increase in  bibasilar atelectasis.  There
 is a possible right pleural effusion.  The differential could include
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm laterally.  Mild upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis.  Early pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
 2. Equivocal small right effusion versus tenting of the hemidiaphragm.
 3. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to more completely assess
 for an underlying pneumonic infiltrate and effusion.
