                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of a new right-sided PICC line with tip ending
 superiorly and likely ending within the right internal jugular vein. 
 Examination somewhat limited due to exclusion of the right costophrenic angle.
 Otherwise, unchanged exam with unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac
 contours.  Stable retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line with tip terminating in right internal
 jugular vein.
