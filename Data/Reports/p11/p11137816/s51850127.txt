 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The nasogastric tube is coiled within the hiatal hernia. Although the distal

 diaphragmatic hiatus and thus the NG tube should be advanced for more optimal
 positioning.  The lung volumes are low. There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely technical.
