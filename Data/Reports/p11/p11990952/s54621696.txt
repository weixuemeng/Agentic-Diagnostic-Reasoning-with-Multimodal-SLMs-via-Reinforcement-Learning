 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 532  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PEA arrest and hypoxemic respiratory

 A single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 5:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet unchanged.  Nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 2. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in

 effusions with some patchy opacities likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis.  The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous.  No overt pulmonary
