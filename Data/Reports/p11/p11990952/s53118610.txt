                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was reviewed in
 comparison with prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.7 cm above the carina and is
 adequately placed.  Right internal jugular line terminates at lower SVC. 
 Bilateral, airspace opacities predominantly in lower lobes have increased
 since ___.  Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema or
 aspiration.  Bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions have worsened since
 ___.  Mediastinal contour is stable. Asssessment of heart size
 was limited due to lung opacities obscuring it margins.  Enteric feeding tube
 is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal
 end is beyond the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral, lower lobe predominant airspace opacities, likely
 edema/aspiration and bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions have
 worsened over last 24 hours.
