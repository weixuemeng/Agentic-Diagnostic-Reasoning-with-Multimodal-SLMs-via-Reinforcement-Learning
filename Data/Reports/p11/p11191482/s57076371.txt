 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after intubation, ET tube withdrawn.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 2:51 p.m.:
 
 Upper enteric drainage tube has been re-positioned, now ending in the upper
 portion of non-distended stomach.  Tip of the endotracheal tube initially
 close to the carina was withdrawn to  3 cm above the carina, standard
 positioning.  Loss of volume in the right lower lung between ___ and earlier
 on ___ is presumably acute.  Most of the abnormalities in the middle lobe
 may relate to previous unilateral intubation.  Followup advised.  Left lung
 generally clear, aside from segmental atelectasis at the lung base medially. 
 Upper lungs well inflated.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size
 is normal.
