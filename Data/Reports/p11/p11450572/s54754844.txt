                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Large pseudocyst status post cystgastostomy with internal drainage,
 roux-en-y pancreatic cyst jejunostomy with NG tube, now with emesis.  Question
 position of NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 NG tube ends in the upper esophagus.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Left basilar opacity likely represents a combination of atelectasis
 and effusion.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No right effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Surgical ___ are noted over the left abdomen.  A
 curvilinear lucency in the mid abdomen potentially represents a component of
 intraperitoneal air which is not unexpected in the early postoperative phase.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. NG tube malpositioned with the tip in upper esophagus.
 
 2. New left basilar opacity likely represents a combination of atelectasis and
 effusion.
