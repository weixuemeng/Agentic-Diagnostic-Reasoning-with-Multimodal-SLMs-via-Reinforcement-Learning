                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  A relative paucity of vasculature in the lung apices is
 suggestive of emphysema.  The main pulmonary arteries are prominent. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aortic arch.  A left-sided
 pacemaker is seen with wires terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
