                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  A subtle opacity is present localizing to
 the right middle lobe such that a pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pulmonary
 edema, pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is seen.  The heart size
 is accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Questionable focal right middle lobe pneumonia. Follow up radiographs may be
 helpful if warranted clinically.
