                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  Low lung volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis, but no focal consolidation is present.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
