                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  EKG changes, assess for cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits evaluation.  There is increased opacity in the right lower
 lung which could reflect bronchovascular crowding, though the possibility of
 an early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Aorta is markedly unfolded.  The heart size is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchovascular crowding versus early pneumonia at the right lung
 base.  If needed, a repeat radiograph with more optimized inspiratory effort
 may be performed to explain pneumonia, otherwise unremarkable.
