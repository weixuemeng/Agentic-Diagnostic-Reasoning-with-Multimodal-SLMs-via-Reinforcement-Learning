                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New kidney transplant evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Cardiac perfusion study from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well-aerated lungs which are
 clear.  Lung volumes are low, which could potentially mimic the appearance of
 cardiomegaly. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes could potentially mimic the appearance of cardiomegaly.  If
 clinically concerned, imaging can be repeated with an emphasis on full
 inspiration.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
