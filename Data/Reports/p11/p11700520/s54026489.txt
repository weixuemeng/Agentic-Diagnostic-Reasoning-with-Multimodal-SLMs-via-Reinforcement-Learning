 only seen on frontal projection is most consistent with atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due
 to low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hypoinflated lungs with left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumonia.
