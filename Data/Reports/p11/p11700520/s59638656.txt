                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F h/o ESRD on HD M/W/F presents with pulsating sharp RUQ/right
 chest pain and nausea without emesis with recent removal of infected
 right-side tunneled catheter, also recently treated for consolidation in right
 lung thought to be PNA.  // PNA v malignancy v other etiology causing
 right-sided pain?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.  There has been
 interval placement of a right subclavian stent.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged as compared to prior
 radiograph. Again, there is the appearance of cardiomegaly, however this is
 unreliable given the extremely low lung volumes.
 
 There is seen a right lower lobe consolidation with an air bronchogram which
 was not seen on prior radiograph, but which likely corresponds to the area of
 right lung consolidation thought to be pneumonia which is mentioned in the
 history. There is right minimal intrafissural fluid in the minor fissure.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Known right lower lobe pneumonia.  No other acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
