                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is marked lung opacification,
 particularly involving the right upper lobe, both lower lobes to some extent,
 however, and also the left perihilar region in the left upper lobe.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe multifocal opacities, with suspicion that they most likely
 represent pneumonia, although a component of coinciding fluid overload is also
 possible.
