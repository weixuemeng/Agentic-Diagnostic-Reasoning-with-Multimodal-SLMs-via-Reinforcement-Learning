                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, with resultant
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing
 for this, heart size is likely normal.  There is mild pulmonary edema and
 vascular congestion. Superimposed on this is increased opacity in the left
 lung base, which likely represents atelectasis, but an early pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis, but an early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion.
