 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are
 seen within the aortic arch.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings suggest mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Additionally, scattered patchy opacities are
 seen within the left upper lobe, and both lung bases, findings which are
 concerning for infection in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified. There are moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.

 Patchy opacities in left upper lobe and both lung bases, findings concerning
 for infection in the correct clinical setting. Probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
