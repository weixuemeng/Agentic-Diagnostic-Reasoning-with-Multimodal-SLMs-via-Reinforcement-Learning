                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall onto face with significant trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 worrisome for small right pleural effusion.  There may be a trace left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  No definite focal consolidation.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  A single-lead right-sided pacemaker
 is seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle. 
 No displaced fracture is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Small right pleural effusion and
 possible trace left pleural effusion.
