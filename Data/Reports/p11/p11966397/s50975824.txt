                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of questionable lung
 resection, evaluate for pulmonary infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  There is status post left-sided pulmonary surgery
 with multiple surgical clips in the left hilar region.  General volume loss of
 the left hemithorax with elevation of the hilar structures, extensive pleural
 densities occupying the entire apical area.  There is moderate elevation of
 the left-sided diaphragm, but the vascular structures of the left lower lobe
 do not demonstrate any additional abnormality.  The right-sided hemithorax is
 unremarkable, similar as it was on the preceding examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable chest findings in comparison with the next preceding study of ___.
 The described findings are consistent with a previous pulmonary surgery
 probably related to pulmonary carcinoma as questioned in the requisition. 
 There is no evidence of any new acute pulmonary infection as can be identified
 on this single chest view.
