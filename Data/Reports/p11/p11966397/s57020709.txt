                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous left upper lobe resection, with
 stable appearance of left upper lobe volume loss and marked pleural
 thickening.  Previously present right lower lobe consolidation has nearly
 resolved with residual ground glass opacities remaining.  Ground glass opacity
 in the left mid and lower lung is likely similar allowing for differences in
 technique between the studies.  No definite new areas of consolidation are
 identified, and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in right lower lobe consolidation with
 residual ground-glass opacities remaining.  Continued radiographic followup is
 suggested to document complete resolution.
