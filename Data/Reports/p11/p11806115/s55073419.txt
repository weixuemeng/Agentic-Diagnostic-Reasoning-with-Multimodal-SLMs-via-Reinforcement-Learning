                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall from standing.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  On the lateral view, the decending aorta is more prominent than
 on prior exams, which could represent a small aneursym at that level.  No
 acute fracture is seen on this limited exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute fracture is seen, but chest radiographs are insensitive for rib
 fractures.  If there is high clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib
 films would be recommended with the sites of tenderness to palpitation marked.
 
 
 2.  On the lateral view, the decending aorta is more prominent than on prior
 exams, which could represent a small aneursym at that level.  Recommend
 correlation with clinical history and physical findings to assess the
 likelihood that the patient's fall was caused by this possible anuerysm or an
 associated acute dissection.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 8:01 a.m. on ___ by phone.
