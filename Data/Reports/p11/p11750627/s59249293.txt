                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, myalgias.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  There is a new subtle
 retrocardiac opacity that is most obvious as a spine sign on the lateral
 radiograph.  Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left base.  There is no
 effusion pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity may be due to summation of shadows, but a focal
 infiltrate cannot be excluded.
