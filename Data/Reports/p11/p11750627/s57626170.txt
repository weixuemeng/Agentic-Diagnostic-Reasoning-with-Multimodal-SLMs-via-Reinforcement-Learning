                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of end-stage renal disease, here to
 evaluate for evidence of tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show increased
 opacification at the left lung base compared to the right and is likely due to
 atelectasis in the setting of decreased inspiratory lung volumes.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without appreciable pulmonary lesions, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged from
 multiple priors.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis most likely in the setting of
 decreased lung volumes.  No evidence of acute or chronic tuberculosis.
