                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increased white blood cell count and lactate,
 suspected pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinum is mildly widened, predominantly
 due to vascularity.  There is increase in perihilar vascularity consistent
 with interstitial pulmonary edema.  Right lower lobe opacity is suspected that
 might reflect infectious process.  No appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
