                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis 
 // Pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pleural effusion has decreased since prior.  No pneumothorax. There is
 mild left pleural effusion, stable.  New left perihilar rounded fullness,
 suggesting mass, similar.  Left mid lung, basilar opacity, with worsened left
 lower lobe consolidation, may represent atelectasis, consider pneumonitis if
 clinically appropriate.  Interstitial prominence bilateral lungs, likely
 edema, with increased pulmonary vascularity, improved since prior.  Heart size
 is difficult to assess secondary to basilar opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Improved right pleural effusion.  Worsened left basilar
 opacities, may represent atelectasis, consider pneumonitis clinically
 appropriate.  Improved pulmonary edema.
 Left perihilar rounded abnormality, suggestive of mass, similar.
