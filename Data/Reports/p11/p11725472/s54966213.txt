                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and rib pain, here to evaluate for pneumonia or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without pleural effusion, focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  Minimal prominence of the right hilus is projectional.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  No acute,
 displaced rib fractures are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No acute, displaced rib fracture seen. If high concern, dedicated rib
 series or CT is more sensitive.
