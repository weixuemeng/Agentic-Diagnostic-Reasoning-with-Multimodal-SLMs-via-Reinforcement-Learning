                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lung volumes are low with chronic
 interstitial opacities and bronchiectasis at the lung bases and periphery
 bilaterally, similar to prior.  Increased patchy opacities in the lung bases
 compared to the previous radiograph may reflect superimposed atelectasis. 
 Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests chronic pleural
 thickening.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease, similar to the previous study. 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect superimposed atelectasis.
