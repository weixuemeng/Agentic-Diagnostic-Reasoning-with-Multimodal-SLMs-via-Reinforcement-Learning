                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough + sputum x 1 week, h/o pulmonary
 hemorrhage in ___ from granulomatous polyangiitis  // r/o pneumonia
 r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiographs, bibasilar opacities have slightly
 decreased in extent and severity. Persistent reticular opacities are
 suggestive of chronic interstitial lung disease, better evaluated on recent CT
 of ___. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is likely due
 to pleural thickening. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Slight improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities.
 3. Reticular opacities compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease.
