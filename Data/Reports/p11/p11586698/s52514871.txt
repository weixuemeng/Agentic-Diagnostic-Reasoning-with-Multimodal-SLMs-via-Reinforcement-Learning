                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M w/ reported hx of pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatosis with
 polyangiitis and lupus who is being transferred from OSH in ___ where he
 presented with worsening cough/hypoxia; 6L O2 requirement, desats w/ movement 
 // source of hypoxemia; OSH CT/CXR disc dropped off to be uploaded for
 comparison
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from an outside hospital on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal and unchanged.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Opacities in the right juxta hilar region have improved,
 however opacity in the right upper lobe appears slightly worse from the prior.
 Additionally, left perihilar opacities have improved however there is
 worsening opacity at the left base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved opacities in the right juxta hilar region and in the left
 perihilar region, but slightly worsened opacities in the right upper lobe and
 at the left base. In a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and
 lupus, these may represent hemorrhage and/or asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
 2. Consider CT for more complete characterization, especially considering
 history of pulmonary fibrosis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 15:17 on ___ by Dr. ___.
