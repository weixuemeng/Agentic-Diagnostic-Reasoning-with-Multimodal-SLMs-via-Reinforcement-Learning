                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:52.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  A left-sided
 subclavian central venous catheter is subtly seen, appears to terminate in the
 region of the mid to proximal left subclavian but not seen more proximal to
 this.  There are relatively low lung volumes without focal consolidation.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter
 seen to the level of the mid to proximal left subclavian without evidence of
 pneumothorax.
