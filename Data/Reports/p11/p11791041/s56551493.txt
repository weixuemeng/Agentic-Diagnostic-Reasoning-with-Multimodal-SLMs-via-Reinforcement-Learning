                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  UTI, SAH, hip replacement, new crackles on right, mild hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  A chest x-ray from ___ at 18:49 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is slight increase in the degree of vascular
 plethora, consistent with mild CHF.  There is also a new relatively triangular
 opacity at the right base laterally.  Some of this may be accounted for by
 pleural fluid, but the possibility of an underlying pneumonic opacity cannot
 be excluded.  The differential diagnosis could include focal pneumonitis or
 pneumonia.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  No gross left effusion. 
 Background cardiomegaly and COPD again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New opacity right base laterally, likely a combination of a small amount
 of pleural fluid and focal pneumonitis or pneumonia.
 
 2.  Increased vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF.
