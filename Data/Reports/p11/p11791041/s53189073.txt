                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Intracranial hemorrhage status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about
 5.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates probably just short of
 the left hemidiaphragmatic inlet.  A streaky left mid lung opacity suggests
 minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear within the limitations
 of technique.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Status post endotracheal
 intubation.  Orogastric tube terminating in the distal esophagus; if gastric
 placement is desired, advancing the tube by at least 10 cm is suggested.
