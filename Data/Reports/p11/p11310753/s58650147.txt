                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary hemorrhage // eval for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded
 lungs. There are stable widespread airspace opacities, which are not
 significantly changed from the prior study, and likely represent pneumonia
 and/or hemorrhage. There is a superimposed wedge-shaped consolidation in the
 left upper lung which is on a background of interstitial lung disease. Dense
 retrocardiac opacity is new over the interval, and may represent atelectasis
 or pheumonia, and/or hemorrhage. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 The endotracheal tube ends 6.2 cm from the carina. Right-sided internal
 jugular central venous line dense at the proximal SVC. There is no
 pneumothorax. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
