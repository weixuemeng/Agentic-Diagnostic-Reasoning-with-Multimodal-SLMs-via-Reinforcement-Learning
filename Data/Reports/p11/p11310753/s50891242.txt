                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis, now with hypoxemia, concern for
 pulmonary edema  // evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison chest radiographs ___ through ___:09, read
 in conjunction with outside chest CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has severe emphysema and tracheal configuration suggesting a
 propensity for tracheomalacia. The emphysema would make the distribution of
 pulmonary edema extremely asymmetric, and difficult to distinguish from
 pulmonary hemorrhage in pneumonia which are more focal.
 
 Progressive heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation following extubation may
 reflect the terminal lesion of positive pressure support rather than real
 worsening. It now involves more of the right upper lobe. Left upper lobe, the
 most severely affected and site of hemorrhage has not improved.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left stable since ___. The
 appearance of the left lower lobe is more suggestive of edema than pneumonia,
 although heart size is normal and mediastinal vasculature has never been
 engorged.
