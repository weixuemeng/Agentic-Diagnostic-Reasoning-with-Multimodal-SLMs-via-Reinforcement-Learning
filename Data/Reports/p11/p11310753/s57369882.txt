                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath status post intubation. 
 Evaluate for is CT tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable AP view through the chest demonstrates an ET tube in
 appropriate position, tip ~4cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen
 descending along the expected course of the esophagus, its distal tip not
 included in the field of view.  Lungs are hyperinflates. There is 
 patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe. Left lower lobe opacity as well
 as more subtle opacity in the RLLL also concerning for pneumonia/aspiration.
 No parge effusion or ptx.  The hilar and mediastinal contour is within normal
 limits.  The heart is normal in size. Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Findings compatible with multifocal pneumonia with underlying COPD.
 2.  ETT in appropriate position. Enteric tube tip not included in FOV.
