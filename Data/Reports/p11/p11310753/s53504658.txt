                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis  // PNA f.u
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitor and support devices are
 unchanged. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease. Prominence of interstitial markings suggests an elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure and there are probable bilateral pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis at the base.
 
 
 
 There is an area of poorly defined opacification in the left mid zone that is
 worrisome for superimposed pneumonia.
