                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded.  Cephalization
 of the pulmonary vasculature is seen, consistent with pulmonary venous
 hypertension.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute
 fracture is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary
 venous hypertension.
 
 2.  No acute fracture is seen, however chest radiographs are insensitive for
 rib fractures.  If clinical concern for rib fractures persists, dedicated rib
 films with markers on any focal point of tenderness would improve detection.
