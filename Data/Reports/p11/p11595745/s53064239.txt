                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right basal opacity
 likely represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although an
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  A left-sided
 Port-A-Cath terminates at the low SVC.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right
 basilar opacity likely represents combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but an underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.
