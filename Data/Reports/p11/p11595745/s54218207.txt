                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Persistent
 moderate-sized right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and/or
 consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes with worsening in the right
 middle lobe.  Although a retrocardiac opacity on the left has slightly
 improved, more peripheral opacification in the left lower lobe has worsened
 and could potentially be due to clinically suspected aspiration or developing
 infectious pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
