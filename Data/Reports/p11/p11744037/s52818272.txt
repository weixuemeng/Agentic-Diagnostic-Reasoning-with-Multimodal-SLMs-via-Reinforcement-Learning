                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall. Evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso performed approximately 4 hr prior to this exam at an
 outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 is a vague focal opacity in the left lower lung which was not present in prior
 torso CT. No other focal opacities are identified. Calcified lymph nodes are
 seen in the left hilum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Please refer to recent CT for description of no thoracic spine fracture not
 appreciated in this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New vague opacity in the left lower lung was not clearly present in torso CT
 performed 4 hr prior and may represent a focus of aspiration versus
 atelectasis.
