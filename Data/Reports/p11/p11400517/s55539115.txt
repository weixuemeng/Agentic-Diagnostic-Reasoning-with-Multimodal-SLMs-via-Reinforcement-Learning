  view overlying the lower thoracic spine could be due to atelectasis although
  developing infection is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p atrial myxoma excision by CT surg on ___ now w/ afib
 and chest pain  // eval ? pleural effusion, infiltrate, PTX, mediastinal
 abnormalities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prior right-sided central venous catheter is no longer visualized.  On the
 lateral view there is increased density projecting over the lower thoracic
 spine new since prior.  This could represent region of atelectasis although
 developing infection is also possible.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear without
 consolidation.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. 
 Linear midlung opacities bilaterally are most suggestive of atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median sternotomy wires are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.  Opacity on the lateral
 view overlying the lower thoracic spine could be due to atelectasis although
 developing infection is not excluded.
