                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with decreased PO and failure to thrive
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Increased interstitial
 markings are noted bilaterally, which may reflect chronic interstitial
 abnormality, as seen previously, with superimposed bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted. 
 Multiple left axillary clips are again noted as well as a remote posterior
 left rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggests a chronic interstitial
 abnormality with probable superimposed bibasilar atelectasis.
