                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MMPs, CHF, weight gain and chest pain.  Evaluate for fluid
 overload, pneumonia or acute changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate stable top
 normal heart size.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged. Abnormal
 contour of the mediastinum with fullness of the right tracheobronchial angle
 is stable from ___.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Stable mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Abnormal contour of the mediastinum with fullness of the right
 tracheobronchial angle could be due to lymphadenopathy, large azygous vein or
 mediastinal cyst. IF there is concern for malignancy, this could be futher
 evaluated with CT; otherwise, prior exams could be helpful to document
 stability if they exist.
