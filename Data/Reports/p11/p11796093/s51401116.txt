  1. Persistent moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left greater than
  right, pleural effusions and severe cardiomegaly.
  2. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
  3. Left lower lobe opacity likely represent combination of pleural fluid,
  atelectasis, and asymmetric pulmonary edema however superimposed infection
  cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
  4. Heterogeneous radiopaque material projecting over central mid hemi thorax
  is consistent with prior vertebroplasty

  1. Persistent moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left greater than
  right, pleural effusions and severe cardiomegaly.
  2. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
  3. Left lower lobe opacity likely represent combination of pleural fluid,
  atelectasis, and asymmetric pulmonary edema however superimposed infection
  cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
  4. Persistent heterogeneous radiopaque material projecting over central mid
  hemi thorax may represent retained contrast within a diverticulum, calcified
  lesion, or contrast within a perforation.  Clinical correlation is
  recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chf, sob.  Assess for fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph from___ from
 05:00.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Somewhat limited evaluation due to patient rotation.
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  No definite change since outside
 study performed ___ hours prior.  Again seen is moderate to moderately severe
 cardiomegaly, though mediastinal and hilar contours are not effectively
 assessed due to considerable the patient rotation.  Also again seen is
 apparent moderate pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral, left greater
 than right, pleural effusions.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 is again seen.
 
 Heterogeneous radiopaque material projecting over the central mid hemi thorax
 is again noted.  Targeted review of an outside CT from ___ suggests
 this lies within the spine and likely represents residua from prior
 kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left greater than
 right, pleural effusions and severe cardiomegaly.
 2. Left lower lobe opacity likely represents combination of pleural fluid,
 atelectasis, and asymmetric pulmonary edema however superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 3. Heterogeneous radiopaque material projecting over central mid hemi thorax
 is consistent with prior kyphoplasty /vertebroplasty.
