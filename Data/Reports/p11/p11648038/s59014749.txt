 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, chronic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia.  Assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Very low lung volumes with diffuse parenchymal opacities at the lung
 bases, left more than right.  Opacities on the left show  diffuse air
 bronchograms, suggesting an infectious or atelectatic process.  Patient is
 again rotated to the right, leading to artificial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and exaggerated width of the mediastinum.
 
 No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.  The presence of
 mild-to-moderate pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
