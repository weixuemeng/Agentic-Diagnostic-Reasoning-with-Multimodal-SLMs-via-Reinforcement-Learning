                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating cardiomediastinal
 contours and resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  This is
 further accentuated by baseline elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  With these
 limitations in mind, there has probably not been a substantial change in the
 appearance of the chest since the recent radiograph of ___ except for
 worsening bibasilar atelectasis and potentially development of small pleural
 effusions.  Repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level would be helpful
 for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
