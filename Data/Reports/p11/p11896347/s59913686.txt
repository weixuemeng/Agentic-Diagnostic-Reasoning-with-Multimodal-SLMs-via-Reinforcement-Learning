 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the
 proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy infrahilar right-sided opacity
 is felt to more likely reflect confluence of vascular structures given
 differences in positioning rather than an early infiltrate. Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical
 assessment. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
