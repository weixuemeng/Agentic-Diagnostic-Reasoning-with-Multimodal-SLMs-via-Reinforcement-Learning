                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left-sided pneumothorax. Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral pneumothoraces, which are small to moderate in size. On
 the left, there are multiple rib fractures, some appearing displaced, with a
 large amount of gas in the adjacent soft tissues extending from the base of
 the left neck to the left upper abdomen. Heterogeneous opacification of the
 left lung base is concerning for pulmonary contusion. A moderate-sized
 layering left pleural effusion, which on the concurrent outside hospital CT
 demonstrates intermediate density, likely representing blood.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Modestly calcified aortic knob is
 noted. The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Bilateral pneumothoraces, small to moderate.
 2. Multiple left-sided rib fractures, some appearing displaced.
 3. Significant gas in the soft tissues of the left thorax.
 4. Layering moderate sized left pleural effusion, representing hemothorax on
