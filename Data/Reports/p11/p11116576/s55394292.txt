                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain after surgery, assess for abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Thin sliver of intraperitoneal
 air under the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with recent surgery.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear
 right basilar atelectasis is noted.  The heart is normal in size with normal
 mediastinal and hilar contours. Dextroscoliosis noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Expected postsurgical free intraperitoneal air without acute
 intrathoracic process.
