                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG/MAZE/___ ligation.  Evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  A
 right internal jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC. Mediastinal and pleural
 drains are unchanged. Compared to the most recent prior study, opacity in the
 right upper lobe has increased. Moderate pulmonary edema is also worse.
 Bibasilar opacities have improved.  There is no large pleural effusion. Tiny
 biapical pneumothoraces are present.   Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Worsening right upper lobe opacity, which may be due to developing
 pneumonia. Improved bibasilar opacities.
 
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema is worse.
 
 3.  Tiny biapical pneumothoraces.
