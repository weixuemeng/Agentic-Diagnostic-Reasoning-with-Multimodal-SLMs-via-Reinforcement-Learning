                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG/MAZE/___ ligation.  Evaluate for pneumothoraces.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided central
 venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC.  Mediastinal and pleural drains
 are stable in position.  There is persistent but improved bilateral patchy
 opacifications, which may represent resolving background pulmonary edema;
 however, there is a persistent, though again slightly improved, opacity within
 the right upper lobe and left mid lung, which may suggest superimposed
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion identified.  No definite pneumothoraces are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  On a background of improving pulmonary edema, there is continued
 opacification of right upper lung and left mid lung, concerning for
 superimposed pneumonia.
