                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for progression of pneumothoraces in
 patient with recurrent chest tube air leak.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ approximately seven hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates increased
 multifocal opacifications particularly evident in the right upper lung and the
 left mid lung.  Though this may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, this is
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration given the
 changing appearance across multiple radiographs.  No pneumothoraces
 identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Medical
 support devices are stable in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Background worsening pulmonary edema, increased multifocal
 opacifications concerning for pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  No
 pneumothorax.
