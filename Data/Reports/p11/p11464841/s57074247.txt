                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for change.
 
 CHEST:  Diffuse interstitial pattern is present, more marked on the right than
 the left, which was not present on the pre-operative film but was present
 though to a slightly lesser extent on the previous chest x-ray of ___. 
 This could represent persistent failure but in the absence of effusions or
 perihilar edema, some other cause including pneumonia should be considered.
