                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG after chest tube
 removal.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier.
 
 After discontinuation of the right and left chest tubes, no definitive areas
 of pneumothorax are seen.  Extensive consolidations are demonstrated
 bilaterally and did not substantially change in the short interim.
