                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent CABG and
 hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  The right internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The left chest tube is in place.
 Heart size appears to be slightly enlarged as compared to prior examination
 that potentially might reflect termination of mechanical ventilation.  On the
 other hand, there is progression of pulmonary edema as well as multiple new
 consolidations demonstrated in the right upper lobe, in the left lower lobe
 and right lower lobe that are concerning for aspiration given the rapidity of
 the development.  There is no pneumothorax appreciated on the right and there
 is questionable minimal pneumothorax on the left.
