                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. 
 Persistent bilateral asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities, likely due
 to asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema.  Although similar to the most
 recent radiograph, they are improved compared to the earlier study of ___ at 3:30 p.m.  Patchy atelectasis has developed at the left lung base.
 No visible pneumothorax.
