                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with worsening leukocytosis, on antibiotic
 therapy, here to evaluate for pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study is available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a rectangular and
 linear opacification projecting over the right lower lung zone which most
 likely represents atelectasis, but a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical context.  Atelectasis of the left lung base is also
 noted.  The lungs are otherwise well aerated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  A wedge compression fracture deformity is noted in the
 lower thoracic spine on the lateral radiograph which is of indeterminate
 chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable atelectasis of the right lung base, but a developing pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
 2.  Wedge compression fracture of unknown chronicity.
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to ___ of surgery and
 ___ of emergency medicine by telephone at 11:45 a.m. on ___.
