                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Bibasilar opacity silhouetting
 the hemidiaphragms are suggestive of effusions, left greater than right, new
 since prior.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen.  Degree of
 cardiomegaly is difficult to assess given silhouetting due to bilateral
 effusions.  Trachea is deviated to the left of the thoracic inlet secondary to
 tortuosity of the great vessels, better characterized by prior CT.  Median
 sternotomy wires and left chest wall single-lead pacing device are identified.
 Dense mitral annular calcifications again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral left greater than right effusions with
 pulmonary edema.
