                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with crackles b/l lung bases  // Eval for acute process, PNA,
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Pacemaker and midline sternotomy
 wires again noted without change in position.  There is calcification
 overlying the left heart likely mitral annular.  Cardiomegaly is again noted. 
 Hila are congested and there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Right
 basal opacity is again noted most compatible with atelectasis, difficult to
 exclude an early pneumonia.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity which
 could represent development of pleural effusion with probable atelectasis,
 also difficult to exclude pneumonia.  No large pneumothorax.  Bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, hilar congestion, mild interstitial pulmonary edema, bibasilar
 atelectasis, probable left pleural effusion.  Difficult to exclude basal
 pneumonia.
