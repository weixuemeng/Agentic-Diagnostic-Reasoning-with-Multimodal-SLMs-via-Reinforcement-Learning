                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New single-chamber pacemaker via a left subclavian approach. 
 Evaluate lead position and any complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___ and earlier on
 ___:
 
 Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead tip projects over the anticipated
 location of the distal interventricular septum, rather than the floor of the
 right ventricle or right ventricular apex where it is usually seen.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion is larger.  Extent of right lower lobe atelectasis is
 difficult to assess, probably not collapsed.  Upper lobes are clear.  Small
 left pleural effusion has increased slightly as well.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding.  Indentation in the right
 anterolateral wall of the trachea is probably caused by a large and tortuous
 innominate artery.  No pneumothorax.
