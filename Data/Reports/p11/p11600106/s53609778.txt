                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion is unchanged since ___ exam. 
 Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is also stable.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely represent compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac size is difficult to assess
 due to adjacent pleural effusions, and is likely enlarged.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Intrathoracic aorta, and mitral
 annulus calcifications are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Perihilar
 vascular congestion is noted.  The patient is status post medial sternotomy.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Moderate-to-large left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions are
 essentially unchanged since ___ exam.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 represent combination of pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation difficult to exclude.
