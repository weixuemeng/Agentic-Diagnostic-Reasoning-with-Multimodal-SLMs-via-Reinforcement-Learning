                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with dense calcification
 in the mitral annulus in a patient with a single-lead pacemaker device that
 extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles persists with mild
 atelectatic changes.
 
 The discordancy between the cardiac size and the normal pulmonary vessels
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
