                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Mitral annular
 calcifications are prominent.  The heart is again markedly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a  mild-to-moderate
 interstitial abnormality corresponding to pulmonary edema, which appears worse
 than on the prior radiographs.  A small-to-moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion is suspected, but difficult to compare to the prior studies.  On the
 right, aeration has improved, but there is probably still patchy right lower
 lobe opacification, suggesting atelectasis, but not specific.  A small pleural
 effusion is also suspected on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Persistent left-sided pleural effusion and patchy basilar
 opacities, not specific, although typical for atelectasis.
