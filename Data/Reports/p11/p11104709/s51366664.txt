                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Profound weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  In this
 patient with known metastatic disease of the chest, there is essentially no
 change in the large masses that occupying the left lower lobe and left upper
 lobe compared with a prior study from earlier this month.  The right lung
 remains clear.  A small left effusion is difficult to exclude.  No right
 effusion seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung lesions, better assessed on prior CT, compatible with
 metastasis without definite interval change.
