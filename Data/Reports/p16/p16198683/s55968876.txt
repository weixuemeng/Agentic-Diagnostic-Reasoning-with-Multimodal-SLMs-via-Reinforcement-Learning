                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain with associated shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities which could be due to
 atelectasis; however, infectious process or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly unremarkable and likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis; however,
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Repeat with deeper inspiration may be helpful for further evaluation.
