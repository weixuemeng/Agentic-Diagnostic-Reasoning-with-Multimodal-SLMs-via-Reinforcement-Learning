                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with AFib with rapid ventricular response.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal
 contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob and
 rightward deviation of the trachea.  The lungs are clear of lobar
 consolidation with minimal basilar vascular congestion.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia; bibasilar pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 2. Rightward tracheal deviation at the thoracic inlet may represent
 asymmetrically enlarged thyroid; US may be considered.
