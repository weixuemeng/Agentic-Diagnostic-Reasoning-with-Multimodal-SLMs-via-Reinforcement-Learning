                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities with an apico-basal
 gradient and associated bilateral hilar engorgement and layering pleural
 effusions, left worse than right, in the setting of large cardiomegaly.
 Rightward deviation of the trachea appears slightly more conspicuous than in
 prior exam, but this may be related to semi-upright position with upward
 displacement of the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Findings compatible with acute pulmonary edema with associated worsening
 pleural effusions in the setting of cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Rightward deviation of the trachea appears slightly more conspicuous than
 on prior but is felt to be due to patient's positioning.  As before,
 evaluation with ultrasound is recommended. This may represent an enlarged
 thyroid but other mediastinal masses cannot be excluded.
