 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Three weeks of cough, new onset of dyspnea on exertion. 
 Questionable chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is a borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia,
 no pleural effusions.  
 
 Small parenchymal nodules with high density could reflect small calcified
 bilateral pulmonary granulomas.
