                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MM, new o2 req, tachycardia, CTA w/
 loculation vs layering effusion with change in resp status  // worsening
 effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An airspace opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects re-expansion of the
 previously demonstrated platelike atelectasis.  The left-sided pleural
 effusion is similar in appearance when compared to the prior study, although
 the loculated interstitial portion is less.  There is persistent left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  The right lung remains clear.  No pneumothorax seen. 
 Hardware related to posterior thoracic spine stabilization and corpectomy is
 unchanged in appearance.  Prior resection of the left eighth rib and old
 healed fractures of the left fifth rib are similar in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in the loculated pleural effusions with new
 airspace opacity in the left lung likely due to re-expansion.  Infection
 cannot be excluded and continued attention on followup is recommended.
