 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:49 PM
  
  -Low lung volumes.  Right middle lobe opacity is similar in appearance to
  prior radiograph from ___.  While this may represent focal right
  middle lobe atelectasis in the setting of persistent thoracic pain,
  persistence in comparison to rib radiograph from ___ is unusual,
  however lung volumes are again low.  Correlate clinically for signs of
  infection or risk factors for aspiration.  Consider close interval follow-up
  and/or further evaluation with chest CT, if clinically appropriate.
  -No focal consolidation elsewhere.
  -No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax or
  pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple myeloma, RML infiltrate seen on
 skeletal survey formal CXR recommended.  // RML infiltrate     RML infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change in appearance of the known right middle lobe parenchymal opacity. 
 The opacities better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal image.  A
 small and like opacity at the left lung bases, in part overlaying the left
 heart border, is constant and has no correlate on the lateral image.  No new
 focal parenchymal opacities.  Overall the lung volumes are low.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat the chest radiograph in ___ weeks, to document
 resolution of the middle lobe opacity.  If the opacity remains unresolved, CT
 must be performed to exclude the presence of a central obstructive lesion.
