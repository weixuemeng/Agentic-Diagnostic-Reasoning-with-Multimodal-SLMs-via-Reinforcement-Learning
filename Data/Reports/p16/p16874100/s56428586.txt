 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated and has a moderately well calcified
 right-sided aortic arch.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, no pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax.  The overall prominence of the pulmonary
 vessels, however, suggests mild fluid overload.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
