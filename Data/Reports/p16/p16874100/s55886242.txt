  1. Increased interstitial markings in the lungs, not dramatically changed
  since prior. This could represent a chronic interstitial process although
  superimposed vascular congestion or atypical infection is possible.
  2. New pleural-based opacity seen posteriorly on the left could represent a
  loculated effusion. If this does not clear on short interval subsequent exams
  by x-ray, CT is advised.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with shortness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided calcified aortic arch is again noted. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  The lungs are clear of focal
 consolidation. Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs are noted
 not dramatically changed since priors. On the lateral view, there is increased
 density projecting over the left pleura posteriorly, potentially a loculated
 effusion or pleural-based soft tissue.  Trace right-sided effusion is
 identified. No focal osseous abnormalities identified.
