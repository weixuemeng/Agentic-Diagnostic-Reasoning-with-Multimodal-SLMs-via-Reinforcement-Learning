 contours otherwise are unremarkable, with interval improvement in the previous
 pattern of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.

 Near complete resolution of the previous pattern of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
