                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is slight increase in AP diameter which may represent
 hyperinflation of the lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible hyperinflation of the
 lungs may indicate obstructive pulmonary disease.
