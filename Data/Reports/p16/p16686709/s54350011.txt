 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment for flank pain, questionable left lower lobe
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild progression
 of the pre-existing and pre-described potentially infectious right lower lobe
 opacity.  The opacity is now accompanied by a small right pleural effusion. 
 On the left, a retrocardiac plate-like atelectasis is seen in almost unchanged
 manner.  No new left-sided opacity has occurred in the interval.  The lung
 volumes remain overall low, the drains in the upper abdomen are in unchanged
 position.
