 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Severe pancreatitis, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.2 cm above the carina.
 The newly placed nasogastric tube follows a normal course, the tip is in the
 distal parts of the stomach.  A substantial part of the left hemithorax,
 notably lateral aspect, is not included in the image.  The presence of larger
 pleural effusion is confirmed.  However, the retrocardiac lung areas show a
 zone of newly appeared atelectatic consolidations.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Biliary drain in situ.
