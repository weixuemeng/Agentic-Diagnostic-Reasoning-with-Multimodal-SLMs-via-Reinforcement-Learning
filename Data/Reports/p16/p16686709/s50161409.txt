                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there are low lung volumes with extensive opacification at the left base,
 consistent with atelectasis and probable small effusion or elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  Right lung is clear and there is no vascular congestion.
 
 PICC line is unchanged.
