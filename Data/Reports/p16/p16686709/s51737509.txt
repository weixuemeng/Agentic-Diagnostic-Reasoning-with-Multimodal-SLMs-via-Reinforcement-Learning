 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis and intubation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has increased
 lung volumes, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory
 pressure.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 Decreased left pleural effusion.  No newly occurred focal parenchymal
 opacities suggesting pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
