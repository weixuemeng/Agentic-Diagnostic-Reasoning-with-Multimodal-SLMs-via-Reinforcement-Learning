                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with pancreatitis and acute respiratory
 distress.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Worsening retrocardiac opacity is
 consistent with increasing atelectasis and small-to-moderate left effusion. 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  ET tube is in standard position. 
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC.
