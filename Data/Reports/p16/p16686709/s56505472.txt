                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with necrotizing pancreatitis, now nauseated and
 vomiting with an elevated white count.  Look for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous left lower lobe pneumonia has coalesced as atelectasis.  There are no
 radiographic findings to suggest pneumonia or empyema.  Left hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, perhaps from subdiaphragmatic mass effect, but there is no
 pneumoperitoneum.  A left PIC ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
