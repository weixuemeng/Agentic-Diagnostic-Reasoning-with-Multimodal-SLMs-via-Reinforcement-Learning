                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with productive cough and
 shortness of breath not improved on antibiotics.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  There is increased opacity
 projecting over the lateral left lung base.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the lateral left lung base may reflect
 atelectasis, but an infectious process cannot be excluded.  Particularly given
 history of no improvement on antibiotics, postobstructive pneumonia is a
 concern.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT for evaluation of the airways is advised.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendation were discussed by Dr.
 ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 3:48 PM,
 30 minutes after discovery of the findings.
