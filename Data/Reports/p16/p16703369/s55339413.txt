                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena
 cava.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a new diffuse interstitial abnormality most suggestive of
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, although other etiologies including
 atypical infection could be considered if clinical findings are discordant. 
 Band-like opacity in the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.
 Posterior costophrenic sulci show mild blunting, so there is potentially a
 trace pleural effusion on either one or both sides.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild diffuse interstitial abnormality most suggestive of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
