                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating 4
 cm above the level of the carinal in appropriate position. An enteric tube is
 identified traversing the thorax in the expected location of the esophagus.
 Left lung field is incompletely imaged.  The right lung field demonstrated
 perihilar opacities thought to reflect aspiration. Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. Osseous structures demonstrates no acute
 abnormality. No large pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in appropriate position. Right hemithorax patchy opacities
 is nonspecific likely reflective of aspiration in correlation with same day
 CT.
