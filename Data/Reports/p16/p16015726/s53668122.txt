                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe hyponatremia and cough  // does
 this patient have atypical pneumonia      does this patient have atypical
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ and earlier today,, 13:50.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is an abnormality in the lingula consisting of a small region of
 consolidation and a more discrete least roughly 15 mm wide pleural-based
 opacity inseparable from and perhaps thickening the anterior pleural surface. 
 This could all be a small pneumonia, but repeat chest radiographs in 4 weeks
 time should be obtained even if patient's signs and symptoms clear to make
 sure that this is not a lung nodule.  In addition clinical consideration
 should be given currently to the possibility of a small pulmonary infarction,
 particularly since the explanation for requesting the earlier chest radiograph
 today was acute chest pain, if that characterization was accurate.
 
 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated but otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are
 normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional chest radiographs in 4 weeks.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___  by
 telephone on ___ at 8:45 AM,  minutes after discovery of the findings.
