 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension in clinic.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 Vague linear opacity projecting over the right mid lung on the frontal view is
 not seen on the lateral, not significantly changed and potentially due to
 scarring given overlying changes in the rib cage.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Linear left basilar opacity is stable.  Right lateral rib fixation plates and
 screws again seen.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
