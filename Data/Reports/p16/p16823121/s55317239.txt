                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  A vague nodularity is noted overlying the right
 upper lobe on the AP view and most likely representative of costochondral
 calcifications at the right anterior first rib. There is mild left basilar
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are without a focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal. 
 No acute fractures identified.  Mild degenerative changes are noted throughout
 the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  The lungs are hyperinlated and suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Additionally, a vague nodularity is noted overlying the right upper
 lobe on the AP view and most likely representative of costochondral
 calcifications at the right anterior first rib. However, given the patient's
 smoking history and evidence of COPD, a dedicated Chest CT is recommended in
 the non-emergent setting is recommended for further characterization.
