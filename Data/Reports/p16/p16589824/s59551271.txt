                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 22:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, check endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 5:50.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 22:31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip
 approximately 3.8 cm above carina.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube
 which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected
 location of the stomach.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size given
 portable technique.  There has been interval reduction in lung volumes with
 suggestion of layering bilateral pleural effusions and patchy left basilar
 airspace disease which may reflect compressive atelectasis in this study with
 no evident effusion, although aspiration or early pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax, although
 the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax has diminished given supine
 technique.
