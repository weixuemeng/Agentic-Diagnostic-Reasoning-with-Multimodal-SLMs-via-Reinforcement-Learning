                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increased respiratory rate and productive cough.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The patient has been extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the NG
 tube.  Heart size and mediastinum appear to be unchanged, but there is still
 bilateral pleural effusion demonstrated and bibasal areas of atelectasis. 
 Mild vascular engorgement is present.  No definitive focal area to suggest
 infectious process is seen, but the increase in basal consolidation is noted
 and might reflect worsening of the atelectasis, potentially related to
 termination of mechanical ventilation.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
