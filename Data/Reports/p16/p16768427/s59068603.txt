                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic breast cancer and cough,
 question infiltrates.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ is submitted.  A
 comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___, selected images
 from a chest CT dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient is status post right mastectomy.  Surgical clips in the right
 axilla consistent with axillary node dissection.  Surgical clips are also seen
 overlying the left lower lung on the frontal projection but are within the
 left breast on the lateral view consistent with prior left breast surgery.  No
 focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  However, the
 findings described on the chest CT are subtle and likely would not be
 radiographically visible.  A sclerotic slightly expansile left fourth
 anterolateral rib lesion is again visualized and may represent a healing
 fracture or metastatic lesion.  The vertebral metastases described on the
 recent chest CT are not appreciated.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.
