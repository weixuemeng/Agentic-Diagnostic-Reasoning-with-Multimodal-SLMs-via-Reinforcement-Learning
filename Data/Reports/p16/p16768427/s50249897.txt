                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // edema or effusion? PE?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is asymmetry of the breast shadows, smaller on the right, with right
 axillary surgical clips, consistent with prior surgery.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD. Heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal or slightly enlarged. Aorta is minimally unfolded. Prominence
 of the right heart border and ascending aorta is noted, but is probably
 similar to the prior study, allowing for technical differences.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, more pronounced than on the prior film,
 with slight vascular plethora. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is new. No gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
 Left apical pleural thickening is unchanged.
 
 No focal infiltrate or frank consolidation is identified.
 
 Sclerotic densities in the left anterior ribs again noted, in keeping with air
 is increased activity on bone scan from ___. .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Status post right breast surgery with axillary clips.
 2. Probable background COPD.
 3. Cardiomegaly with prominence of the ascending aorta. Allowing for
 differences in positioning, this is probably unchanged.
 4. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is new compared with
 the prior film and suggests mild fluid overload.
 5. No pneumothorax or focal infiltrate identified.
