                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube was initially placed in the mid thoracic
 esophagus, but has been subsequently advanced on serial radiographs with
 eventual location in the distal stomach.  Otherwise, little change in the
 appearance of the chest since the recent radiograph from earlier the same date
 except for improving aeration at the right lung base.
