                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 Radiograph was obtained for assessment of nasogastric tube, which has now been
 advanced into the stomach.  Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the
 chest since the recent study where allowances are made for differences in lung
 volumes.
