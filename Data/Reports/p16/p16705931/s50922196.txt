                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure, which
 is a normal variant.  Right basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis has
 cleared.  Vague retrocardiac opacity probably referring the left lower lobe
 persists but has improved.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.  A right-sided
 pleural effusion has resolved.  A PICC line is been removed.  Surgical clips
 again project over each axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolution of right pleural effusion and minor associated atelectasis. 
 Improvement in retrocardiac opacity, the latter possibly due to pneumonia
 versus atelectasis or lower airway inflammation.
