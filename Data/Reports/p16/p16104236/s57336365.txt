  1. An accessed right pectoral port catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial
  junction.
  2. New small left pleural effusion.
  3. No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
  4. Atelectasis or scarring in the left lung base simulates a gastric bubble. 
  Finding is similar to mesenteric angiogram dated ___, which
  demonstrated that there is no hiatal hernia (___:8 on that study).

  1. An accessed right pectoral port catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial
  junction.
  2. New small left pleural effusion.
  3. No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
  4. Prominent retrocardiac gastric bubble may represent gastric distention or a
  paraesophageal hiatal hernia.  The esophageal stent projects in unchanged
  location.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Esophageal cancer, with nausea vomiting and p.o. intolerance.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.  PET-CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right Port-A-Cath terminates at the upper right atrium.  A lower esophageal
 stent is unchanged in configuration.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours remain within normal limits.  There is appearance of a
 gas bubble at the left base, which may be due to atelectasis, as no large
 hiatal hernia is demonstrated on recent examinations, including a PET-CT from
 ___.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.
