                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with difficulty swallowing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  Prominence
 of the distal mediastinal contour at the gastroesophageal junction likely
 reflects the patient's known adenocarcinoma within this region.  Hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the distal mediastinal contour at the gastroesophageal junction
 likely reflects the patient's known adenocarcinoma in this region.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise visualized.
