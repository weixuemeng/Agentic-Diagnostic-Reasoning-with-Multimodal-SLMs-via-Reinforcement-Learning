 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation, amiodarone, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, likely due to a lesser inspiratory effort.  There is unchanged
 evidence of a hiatal hernia as well as of mild cardiomegaly.  Unchanged
 calcified granuloma at the right lung bases.
 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma, no infection,
 in particular no evidence of fibrotic lung changes.  No pneumothorax.
