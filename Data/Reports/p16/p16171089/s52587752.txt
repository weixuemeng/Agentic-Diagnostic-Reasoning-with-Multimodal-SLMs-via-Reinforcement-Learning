                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Two weeks of cough and crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Enlargement of the right hilus and pulmonary outflow tract are longstanding,
 and suggest chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is no consolidation
 or associated atelectasis.    Heart size is normal.  Lungs are clear.  The
 large osteophytes in the midthoracic spine should not be mistaken for lung or
 pleural lesions.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The separation of
 minimal calcification from the lateral edge of the aortic knob is probably a
 function of the aortic shape, and has not changed for more than ___ years.  It
 is not an indication of acute aortic dissection.
