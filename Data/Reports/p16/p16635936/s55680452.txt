                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 posterior basilar opacity on the lateral view seen on various multiple prior
 studies, may be due to Morgagni hernia/focal eventration without definite
 focal consolidation seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable with the cardiac
 silhouette top normal and the aorta tortuous.  Mild prominence of the hila is
 stable.  Slight rightward tracheal deviation may be due to patient's known
 goiter.
