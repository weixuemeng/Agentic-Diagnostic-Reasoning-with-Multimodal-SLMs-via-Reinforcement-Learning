                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB and wheezing  // r/o acute process     
 r/o acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much better
 inspiration.  There is still substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with no evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  This discordance
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Blunting of
 the costophrenic angles could be a manifestation of small effusions or merely
 some residual pleural thickening.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
