                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with L face numbness and L arm weakness  // eval for pna,
 eval for bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current frontal view with secondary crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  Apparent enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is also likely due to lower lung volumes.  Right basilar opacity
 may be secondary to atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding, superimposed vascular
 congestion is possible.  Right basilar opacity likely atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
