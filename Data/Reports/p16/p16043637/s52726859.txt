                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient admitted for syncope, found to be in
 complete heart block, status post pacer placement with atypical posterior
 shoulder pain, evaluate for pneumothorax and check lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of the prior day.  During the examination interval, the patient
 has received a permanent pacer capsule now seen in left anterior axillary
 position being connected to two intravascular electrodes terminating in right
 atrial appendage and right ventricular apical portion position.  The heart
 size is unchanged and remains within normal limits.  The metallic structure of
 an aortic valve prosthesis is seen in place as before.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested, there are no new acute infiltrates and no pneumothorax is
 identified on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement, newly
 implanted permanent pacer, unremarkable position of electrode termination and
 no pneumothorax.
