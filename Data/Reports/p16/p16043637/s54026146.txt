                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position with two leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as before.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and aortic valve repair with aortic valve
 prosthesis, unchanged in position and intact-appearing sternotomy wires.  The
 cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are mildly increased in size in
 comparison to the most recent prior study likely attributable to slightly
 decreased lung volumes compared to the prior exam.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Hazy opacification of the bilateral lung
 bases is likely related to underpenetration of soft tissues on technique. 
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
