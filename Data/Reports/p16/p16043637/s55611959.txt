 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PICC  // PICC placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change in appearance of
 the lung parenchyma and the cardiac silhouette is seen.  The position of the
 tip of the PICC line remains difficult to determine, given that the line
 parallels the radiodense pacemaker leads.
