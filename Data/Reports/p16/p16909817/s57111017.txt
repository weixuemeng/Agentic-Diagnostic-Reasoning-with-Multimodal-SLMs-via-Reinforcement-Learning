                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Port-A-Cath not flushing, please evaluate for position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, unchanged in position, likely terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  The lungs remain hyperinflated and
 relatively lucent, consistent with COPD with likely underlying emphysema. 
 Bilateral nipple shadows should not be mistaken for pulmonary nodules.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Left apical pleural thickening/possible small amount of fluid
 along the left apical region is stable since the prior study.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable with the right-sided cardiac
 silhouette not well assessed due to it being likely projecting behind the
 spine, but the findings are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath likely
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.
 2.  COPD.
