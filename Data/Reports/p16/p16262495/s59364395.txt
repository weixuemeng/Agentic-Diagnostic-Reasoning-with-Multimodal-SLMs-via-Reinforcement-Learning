                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, here for CHF exacerbation, cough, not
 improving, question acute infection.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A left-sided single-lead pacemaker type device is present.  
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly. Allowing for differences in technique, the
 cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger than on ___ radiograph.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, with mild vascular plethora and slight
 thickening of the minor fissure.  There is patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 region and minimal atelectasis at the right base, which also are more
 pronounced than on the prior study.  No frank consolidation and no gross
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Allowing for technical differences, the cardiac silhouette appears
 slightly larger.
 2.  Mild vascular plethora, also slightly increased, without overt CHF.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank consolidation.  However, the differential
 includes an early pneumonic infiltrate at the left base.
