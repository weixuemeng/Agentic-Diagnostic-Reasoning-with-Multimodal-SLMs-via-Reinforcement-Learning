                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right frontal meningioma resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:  A nasogastric tube again passes into the stomach
 and off the inferior margin of the film.  Right PICC extends to the cavoatrial
 junction, possibly into the upper right atrium.  The lungs are unchanged in
 appearance with persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  No new
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax or large effusion.  There is
 bronchovascular crowding and mild vascular congestion without convincing
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change from one day prior.
