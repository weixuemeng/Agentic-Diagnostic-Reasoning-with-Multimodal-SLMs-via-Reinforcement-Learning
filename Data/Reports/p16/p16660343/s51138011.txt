 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter is
 malpositioned in the right main bronchus.  Immediate repositioning is required
 (a later radiograph from the same patient, taken at 2:11, documents this
 repositioning).  No evidence of complications such as pneumothorax.
