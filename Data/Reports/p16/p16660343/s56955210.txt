                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with new tracheostomy and
 increased respiratory secretions, evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and Chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously noted right basilar opacity has increased and likely represents
 increase atelectasis, perhaps due to aspiration.  Left basilar opacity appears
 stable and likely a combination of small pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis.  Upper lung ___ are clear.  Tracheostomy is noted in place.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right basilar opacity, likely representing atelectasis and perhaps
 due to aspiration.  An overlying infectious process must be excluded in the
 proper clinical setting.  Otherwise little change with stable left basilar
 opacity suggesting a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
