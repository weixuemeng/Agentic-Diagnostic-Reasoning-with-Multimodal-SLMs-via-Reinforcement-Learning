                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___ CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with known saddle pulmonary embolus, transferred for
 further management.  Baseline chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP chest radiograph shows minimal streaky left
 retrocardiac density suggesting subsegmental atelectasis.  Increased
 distention of the azygos vein compared to an outside study from one day
 earlier may be related to patient's position and central pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  Cardiac contour is unchanged compared to yesterday's exam.
