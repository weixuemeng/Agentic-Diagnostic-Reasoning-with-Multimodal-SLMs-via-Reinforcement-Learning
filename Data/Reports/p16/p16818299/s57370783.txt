                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p chest tube  // eval for ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Sternal wires and an
 aortic valve replacement are again demonstrated.  A left apical pneumothorax
 is decreased in size from ___ and is small.  A small left-sided chest
 tube projects over the left hemi thorax.  A displaced midclavicular fracture
 on the left is unchanged.  A small left pleural effusion is minimally
 increased in size.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are identified.  Of
 note, there is irregularity of the left eighth rib, suggesting possible
 osseous lesions/pathologic rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is decreased from the prior exam.  Small left
 pleural effusion is minimally increased in size.  No other significant change.
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again seen as mentioned above including
 a possible osseous lesion affecting the left 8th rib.
