 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is again at the
 upper limits of normal size.  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities are consistent with minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Small anterior
 osteophytes are similar along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  There has been
 no significant change.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
