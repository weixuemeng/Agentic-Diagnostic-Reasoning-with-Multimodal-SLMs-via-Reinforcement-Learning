 interstitial structures at the lung bases.  However, there is no circumscribed
 area of increased opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Elevation of the
 hemidiaphragm, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta, and no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 No lung nodules or masses.
