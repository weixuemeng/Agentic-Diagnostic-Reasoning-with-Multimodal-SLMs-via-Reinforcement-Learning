                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with bleeding after
 polypectomy assessment for the ET tube and NG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.2 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach, although the stomach is substantially distended.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly stable.  Lungs are low in volumes with right middle
 lobe atelectasis, but overall there is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 increased pleural effusion.
