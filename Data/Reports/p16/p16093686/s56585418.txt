                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. Streaky right infrahilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis
 associated with diaphragmatic elevation.  There is no definite evidence for
 pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  There is apparently an exostosis or perhaps posttraumatic bony
 hypertrophy arising from the right posterior eighth rib.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right basilar opacities, probably associated with
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, although airway inflammation or
 infection is difficult to entirely exclude.
