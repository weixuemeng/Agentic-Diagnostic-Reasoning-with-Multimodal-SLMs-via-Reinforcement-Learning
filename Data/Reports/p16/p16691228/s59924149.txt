                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Left pleural effusion appears to be increased in the interim, large.  The
 mediastinum is slightly more shifted to the right, but given the relatively
 mild shift, underlying atelectasis/collapse of the lung is present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No newly developed abnormalities are demonstrated in the
 right lung.  No right pleural effusion appreciated.
