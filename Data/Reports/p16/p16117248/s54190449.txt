                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, malaise, LUQ pain. hx lobectomy  // eval
 for pneumonia, acute intraabdominal process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is slightly suboptimal due the patient's overlying
 arm.Right-sided VP shunt is re- demonstrated, inferior aspect not well seen
 due to underpenetration of the upper abdomen.  Prominence of the right hilum
 is stable.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal in size to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique. 
 Persistent mild right pleural thickening with associated subtle deformity of
 lateral right-sided rib(s), may relate to prior trauma.  Chronic left rib
 deformities also re- demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
