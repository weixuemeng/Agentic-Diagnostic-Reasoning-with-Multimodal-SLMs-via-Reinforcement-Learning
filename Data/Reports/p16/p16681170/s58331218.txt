                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An interstitial abnormality has improved substantially.  There is
 suggestion of persistent reticulation in the lower lungs, however, which
 suggests underlying interstitial disease, as was reported previously.  There
 is no focal opacification suggestive of pneumonia.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Although difficult to exclude, there are
 no definite pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute abnormality, although a persistent
 heterogeneous predominantly peripheral interstitial abnormality suggests
 underlying interstitial lung disease.
