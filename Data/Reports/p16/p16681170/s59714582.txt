 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is moderate
 interstitial abnormality, probably unchanged, suggesting known interstitial
 abnormality but perhaps with coinciding pulmonary edema. However, there is no
 focal opacification. Fissures appear mildly thickened. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable interstitial abnormality suggesting combination of interstitial edema
 and underlying known interstitial lung disease.
