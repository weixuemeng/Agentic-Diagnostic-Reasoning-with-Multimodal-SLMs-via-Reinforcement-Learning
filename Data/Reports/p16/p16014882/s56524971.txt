                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  New when compared to priors, diffuse parenchymal
 opacities throughout the right lung as well as trace right-sided pleural
 effusion.  Left lung remains grossly clear noting some increased interstitial
 markings, unchanged from prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are
 the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy regions of consolidation in the right lung compatible with
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Repeat exam after treatment
 suggested to document resolution.
