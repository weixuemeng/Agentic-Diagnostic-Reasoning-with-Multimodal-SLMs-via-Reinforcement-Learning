                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with triple-lead pacer device and right PICC line in
 place.  There is the vague suggestion of some patchy opacification at the
 right base medially.  In view of the clinical history, this could represent a
 developing consolidation.
