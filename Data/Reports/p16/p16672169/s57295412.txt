                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with wheezing and shortness of breath.
 History of cardiomyopathy, questionable asthma, questionable CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly as before.  Unchanged
 position of previously described permanent pacer in left anterior axillary
 position and dual intracavitary electrode pacing system with position in right
 atrial appendage and right ventricular apical portion.  A third electrode is
 in typical coronary sinus position terminating in a location compatible with
 the obtuse marginal vein.  The electrodes are in completely unchanged position
 in comparison with the previous study.  The degree of cardiomegaly has not
 changed significantly, but noticeable is that the left cardiac border is now
 somewhat more separated from the left chest wall, which would suggest some
 improvement of the previously described marked cardiomegaly.  Coinciding is a
 finding which favors this assumption in as much as the previously present
 upper zone vascular redistribution pattern in the pulmonary circulation has
 decreased, which would indicate a slightly lower left atrial filling pressure.
 There is no evidence of new pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion, or
 parenchymal infiltrates.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Radiographically mild degree of improvement with suggestion of
 slightly diminished cardiomegaly and lesser upper zone redistribution pattern.
 No evidence of acute infiltrates.
