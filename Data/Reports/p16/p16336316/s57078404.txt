                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with right lower rib pain and headache after fall.  Assess
 for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well inflated and clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.
