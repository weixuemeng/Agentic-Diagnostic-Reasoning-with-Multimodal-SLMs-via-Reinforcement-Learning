 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are unchanged.
 However, there is a slight widening an increase in density of the right upper
 aspect of the mediastinum, with a questionable contour abnormality seen in
 this location. These changes were not evident on the previous image. Given the
 clinical presentation of the patient, computed tomography should be performed
 to rule out mediastinal abnormalities.
 Mild elongation of the descending aorta. Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  Normal appearance of the hilar structures
 on the lateral image.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Observations were added to the radiology dashboard.
