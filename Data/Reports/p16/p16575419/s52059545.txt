                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  No radiograph comparison available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal, possibly
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for acute process.
 Of note, a trace pericardial effusion was seen on CT abdomen and pelvis dated
 ___ and therefore mild cardiomegaly, although likely secondary to low
 lung volumes, small underlying pericardial effusion can not be excluded.
