  Hyperinflated lungs, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
  
  Subtle rounded density projecting over the anterior right fifth rib which may
  relate to the edge of the anterior rib, however, underlying pulmonary nodule
  is not excluded. No priors for comparison. Recommend shallow oblique views or
  nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.
  
  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

 edema.
