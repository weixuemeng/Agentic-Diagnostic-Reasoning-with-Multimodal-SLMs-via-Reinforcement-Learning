                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion and bradycardia  // mediastinal
 widening?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the knob.  The mediastinal contours are otherwise
 within normal limits.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation. 
 Prominence of the hila could reflect enlargement of the pulmonary arteries,
 without evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative
 changes detected in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for mediastinal widening.  Tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic
 calcifications at the arch.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
