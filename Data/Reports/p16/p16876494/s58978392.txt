                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Thoracic spine radiograph ___, MR thoracic spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted at the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of underlying COPD. Biapical pleural
 scarring is symmetric.  Minimal patchy opacities are noted in the left lower
 lobe, which may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  Severe
 compression fracture of the T12 appears chronic as do multiple left-sided
 posterior rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, but cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
