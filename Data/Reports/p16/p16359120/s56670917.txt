                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve
 replacement and maze. 
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Overall, the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 including the perihilar opacities on the right and evidence of
 pneumopericardium on the left, although there is improvement in the vascular
 congestion and slightly improved overall aeration of the lungs.  No definitive
 pneumothorax is seen.  Note is made that the left costophrenic angle was not
 included in the field of view.
