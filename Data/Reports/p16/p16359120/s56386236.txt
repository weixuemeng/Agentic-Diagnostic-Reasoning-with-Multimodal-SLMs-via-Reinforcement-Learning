 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal fluid overload is still
 present.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are constant in appearance.  Also
 constant is the left lower lobe atelectasis.  The extent of the pleural
 effusions has not substantially changed.  The effusions are better seen on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.
