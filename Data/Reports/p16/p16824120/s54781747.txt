                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, on chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 is noted.  At least 3 nodular opacities are seen, 2 within the right upper
 lobe, and one within the left upper lobe, which were present on the prior CT
 torso.  Other smaller pulmonary nodules seen on the CT are not clearly
 demonstrated on the current exam.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the
 left posteriorly suggests a small left pleural effusion, new from the prior
 exam.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is diffuse demineralization of
 the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Bilateral pulmonary nodules, better demonstrated on the prior CT,
 compatible with known metastatic lesions.
