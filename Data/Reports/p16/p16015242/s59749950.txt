 and productive cough, evaluate for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is persistent opacification of the right lung base, and although this
 may be due to known mass but superimposed pneumonia could be considered. Lungs
 are hyperexpanded. There is a small right pleural effusion. There is mild
 cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung base opacification, likely from known mass. However, if clinically
 appropriate, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
