                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post recent median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative
 period.  Moderate size left pleural effusion has increased in size in the
 interval, but a small right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. 
 Worsening lung opacification involving the left lower lobe and inferior aspect
 of the lingula may reflect atelectasis associated with the effusion but
 infectious consolidation could produce a similar appearance.  Minimal patchy
 atelectasis is present at the right lung base with otherwise clear right lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.
