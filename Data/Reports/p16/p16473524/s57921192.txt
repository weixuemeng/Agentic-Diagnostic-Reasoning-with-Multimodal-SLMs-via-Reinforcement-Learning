  New right IJ central catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  Median sternotomy
  wires are intact.  Left pleural drain is unchanged.  No pneumothorax. 
  Retrocardiac opacity and bibasilar atelectasis are similar to prior, allowing
  for differences in patient positioning.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
 mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Left chest tube remains
 in place with increasing, now moderate-sized left pleural effusion, as well as
 a possible small left apical pneumothorax, difficult to assess due to overlap
 of soft tissue structures in the left apex.  Attention to this region on a
 repeat radiograph with improved positioning would be helpful in this regard. 
 Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis adjacent to the left pleural effusion. 
 Persistent small right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar lung
 atelectasis.
