                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with syncope, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs demonstrate a basal predominant
 interstitial opacity which could reflect underlying emphysema or interstitial
 lung disease without acute focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.  Sternal wires and surgical clips are compatible
 with prior CABG.  The dual-lead pacemaker is also noted.  Endplate concavity
 in mid thoracic vertebral bodies is seen at multiple levels and likely
 reflects age-indeterminate compression fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Compression fractures in the thoracic spine of uncertain chronicity and
 correlation with exam findings is recommended.
