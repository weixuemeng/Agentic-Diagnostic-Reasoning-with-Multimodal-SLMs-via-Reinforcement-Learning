                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Unchanged small bi-apical pneumothoraces, and persistent abnormal
 course of left PICC with configuration suggesting entry into the azygos vein
 (please see documented communication and preliminary report above).  Overall,
 little change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of a few
 hours earlier except for slight improved aeration in the left retrocardiac
 area.
