                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve repair, assessment for pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, the extent of the bilateral
 pneumothoraces has slightly decreased.  The pneumothoraces are millimetric in
 ___ and small.  There is no evidence of tension.  The previously
 misplaced PICC line is now in correct position, with the tip projecting over
 the lower SVC.  An area of atelectasis at the left lung base has minimally
 increased in extent.  Right lower lung atelectasis, combined to some pleural
 effusion, is constant in appearance.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No new parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.
