                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Question cardiomegaly.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable view of the chest demonstrates clear lungs.  Low lung
 volumes somewhat accentuates the cardiac size.  No pleural effusion or edema. 
 Bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  To better assess for
 cardiomegaly a PA film with better inspiration should be considered.
