                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage
 and subarachnoid hemorrhage, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable AP radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior radiograph, there is mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  The opacity in the left lower lobe, likely atelectasis, is
 improving.  Left pleural effusion is slightly smaller.   There is no new
 parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.    Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  A right PICC catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  There is a
 feeding tube coiled within the stomach.  Osseous structures demonstrate
 multiple healed rib fractures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2. Improving left pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis.
