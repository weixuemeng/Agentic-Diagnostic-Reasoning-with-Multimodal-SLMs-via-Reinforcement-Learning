                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left frontal hemorrhage, lethargy,
 leukocytosis.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiographs on ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  The right lung demonstrates mild
 interstitial markings that appear slightly improved compared with prior exam. 
 The left lung demonstrates basilar atelectasis with associated pleural
 effusion not significantly changed since prior examination.  Cardiac size
 cannot be properly assessed due to rotation of the patient during acquisition.
 Multiple rib fractures in the right are better assessed in prior CT. There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Monitoring and supportive devices are noted in
 expected positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal if any interval improvement of interstitial markings.  No
 significant interval change in left lower lobe atelectasis with associated
 left-sided pleural effusion.
