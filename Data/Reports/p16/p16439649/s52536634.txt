                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip ends 6 cm above the carina, orogastric tube
 courses up to the gastroesophageal junction with its side port 7 cm above the
 GE junction.  Consider advancing the orogastric tube by 9-10 cm for better
 seating.  Right PICC line tip is at mid SVC.  Since yesterday, increased
 retrocardiac density deflecting left lower lung atelectasis has improved. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar.  Minimal right basilar
 atelectasis is present.  Upper lungs are clear.  Multiple chronic right sided
 rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over the last 24 hours, left lower lung atelectasis has improved
 and bilateral small pleural effusions and right basilar atelectasis is
 unchanged.  The orogastric tube tip is at the gastroesophageal junction with
 side port ending 7 cm above the GE junction.  Consider advancing the
 orogastric tube by additional 9-10 cm for better seating.
