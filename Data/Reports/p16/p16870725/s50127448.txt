                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, question pneumonia, TB.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and no obvious pulmonary nodules are
 detected.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  No calcified lymph nodes, or
 fibronodular scarring is detected.  
 
 Probable very mild right convex curvature of the thoracic spine centered at T5
 and mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine, more than expected in
 someone of this age.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Mild degenerative changes and scoliosis in the thoracic spine
 noted. Otheriwse, chest x-ray examination within normal limits.  No findings
 to confirm the presence of pulmonary TB or pneumonia.
