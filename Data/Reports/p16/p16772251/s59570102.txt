  Mild cardiomegaly, predominantly left ventricular enlargement, consistent with
  patient's known VSD, though pericardial effusion cannot be definitively
  excluded. Recommend correlation with physical exam and EKG findings. If there
  is persistent clinical concern, echocardiography could be considered for
  further evaluation.

  Mild cardiomegaly, predominantly left ventricular enlargement, consistent with
  patient's known VSD, though pericardial effusion cannot be definitively
  excluded. Recommend correlation with physical exam and EKG findings. If there
  is persistent clinical concern, echocardiography is more sensitive for
  detection of pericardial effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with prior hx ? VSD repair as infant now w/ 1D CP, sharp,
 EKG suspicious for pericarditis  // eval ? cardiomegaly, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  There is no central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary
 edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly, predominantly due to an enlarged left ventricle, which is
 consistent with prior VSD, though could reflect a small pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly, predominantly left ventricular enlargement, consistent with
 patient's known VSD, though pericardial effusion cannot be definitively
 excluded.  Recommend correlation with physical exam and EKG findings.  If
 there is persistent clinical concern, echocardiography could be considered for
 further evaluation.
