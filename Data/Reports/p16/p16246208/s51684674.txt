                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and the patient's neck and chin
 obscuring assessment of the lung apices.  Low lung volumes are present. 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device with leads main and right atrium
 right ventricle is re- demonstrated.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged. 
 The aorta is tortuous, as seen previously.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present without gross pulmonary edema.  Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Loss of height 2 adjacent mid thoracic
 vertebral body appears new in the interval, but likely chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Limited study due to patient positioning.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 2. Interval development of 2 mild compression deformities in the mid thoracic
 spine, likely chronic.
