                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  On the
 lateral view, external artifact projects over the posterior thorax, partially
 obscuring the view.  Given this, there is a left greater than right mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  External artifact projects over the posterior chest on the
 lateral view, somewhat limiting its evaluation.  Otherwise, aside from mild
 bibasilar atelectasis, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
