                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Relatively low lung volumes with the cardiac silhouette at the upper limits of
 normal.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
