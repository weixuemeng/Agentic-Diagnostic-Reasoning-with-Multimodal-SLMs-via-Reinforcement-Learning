 HISTORY:  ESLD and SBO requiring decompression, pulled NG tube, question NG
 tube placement.
 
 CHEST, 1 PORTABLE VW
 
 Compared with ___, an NG tube has been placed.  The tip and side port
 lie beneath the diaphragm.  The tip overlies the lower portion of the gastric
 body.  A double contour over the right hemidiaphragm laterally appears to
 relate to undulation of the hemidiaphragm interfacing with the lung and is
 therefore of doubtful clinical significance.  No acute pulmonary process
 identified.  Incidental note made of asymmetry of the clavicular heads.
