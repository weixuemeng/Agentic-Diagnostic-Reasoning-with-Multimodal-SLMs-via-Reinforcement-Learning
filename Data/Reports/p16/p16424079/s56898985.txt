                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided rib pain after a fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Streaky right basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis associated with low
 lung volumes.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Small degenerative changes are noted along the mid
 thoracic spine.  There is no evidence for recent fracture.  Irregularity along
 the course of the anterolateral right fourth rib suggests there may be a
 remote prior fracture, however, unchanged since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of injury.
