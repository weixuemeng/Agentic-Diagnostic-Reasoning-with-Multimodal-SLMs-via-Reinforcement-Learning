                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachypnea, hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified are bilateral glenohumeral prosthetic devices.  There is
 significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph. 
 Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are
 stable, reflective of moderate cardiomegaly.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion and possibly early or mild pulmonary edema.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no definite focal lung consolidation, however the right
 lung is at least partly obscured medially and at its inferior aspect due to
 patient rotation, making evaluation of the right lung difficult.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is no sizable pleural effusion, although difficult to
 exclude trace left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Limited study due to rotation and low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion and possible early or mild pulmonary edema.
 2. No definite focal consolidation, however there is limited evaluation of the
 right lung due to patient rotation.  If there is continued clinical concern
 for pneumonia, recommend repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory
 effort and technique.
