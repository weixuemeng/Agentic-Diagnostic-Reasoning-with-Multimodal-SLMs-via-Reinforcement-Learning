 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Emesis, evaluation for nasogastric tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the intragastric portion of
 the nasogastric tube has slightly changed in position.  The tip is now more
 proximal, with a coiling at the level of the gastric fundus.  The tip is
 directed towards the gastroesophageal junction.  Repositioning of the device
 might be considered.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases are
 constant in appearance.
