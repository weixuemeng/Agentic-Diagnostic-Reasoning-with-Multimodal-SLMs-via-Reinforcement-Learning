                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malignant ascites and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, presenting with
 hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  A nasogastric
 tube terminates in the stomach.  Biliary stents and coils projecting over the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen appear unchanged.  The right hemidiaphragm
 is mildly elevated with fairly similar streaky right basilar opacification
 suggesting minor atelectasis.  There is probably a very small pleural effusion
 on the left.  Patchy opacities projecting over the left mid lung have
 improved, although with a persistent nodular focus measuring about 5 mm in
 diameter over the left lateral mid lung, which is indeterminate.  Retrocardiac
 opacities have increased, which may reflect worsening area of pneumonia versus
 increased volume loss superimposed on pneumonia.
