 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Diabetes and hypertension with left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is similar mild relative elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm, compared to the left.  Minimal left basilar opacity
 appears unchanged and suggests minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
