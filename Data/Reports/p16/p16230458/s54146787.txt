                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage. Confirm
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 5.7 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube is seen
 ending beyond the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip out of view.
 Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 Assessment of pulmonary pathology is limited due to limitations of this exam,
 including anti lordotic projection and low lung volumes. However bilateral
 opacities in the perihilar regions and projecting over the cardiophrenic
 angles are present, more pronounced in the left. There is obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm margin. There may be a small layering pleural effusion in
 the left as well. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina at the thoracic inlet.
 Esophageal tube in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Bilateral opacities, left worse than right, may represent infection versus
 aspiration.
