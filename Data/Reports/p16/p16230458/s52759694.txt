 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous, elongated, and dilated,
 better seen in prior CT from ___.  Increasing opacities in the bases
 of the lungs, seen in the lateral view, are increased compared to prior study
 from ___ and could represent pneumonia, less likely worsening
 atelectasis.  In the frontal view, it is difficult to localize them, likely on
 the right.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Sternal wires are
 aligned.  Biapical pleural thickening is stable.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 3:35 p.m.,
