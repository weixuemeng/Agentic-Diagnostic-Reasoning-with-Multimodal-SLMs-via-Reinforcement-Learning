                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with thymic cancer  // Interval change s/p
 bronchoscopy?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and right
 apical radiation fibrosis changes are stable. There may be an increased small
 right pleural effusion. Aeration of the residual right lung is decreased, with
 worsening opacification, which might be attributed to decreased lung volumes
 compared with the prior study. Asymmetric pulmonary edema or superimposed
 pneumonia are possible in the proper clinical setting. The right apical small
 collection of air and fluid is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased aeration of the residual right lung with worsening opacification,
 which might be attributed to decreased lung volumes, though asymmetric edema
 or superimposed pneumonia are possiblities.
