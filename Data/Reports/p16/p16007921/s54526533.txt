                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with known metastatic thyroid cancer with
 upper back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT from ___, FDG tumor study
 from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple bilateral nodules are visualized throughout the lungs,
 consistent with patient's known metastatic disease.  Right apical mass is
 again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged but stable. 
 There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes as well as small right pleural
 effusion.  Spinal fixation hardware and median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 The right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated, possibly due to phrenic nerve
 palsy.
