                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung remains mostly clear but again shows several nodules which are
 not clearly changed although difficult to compare directly for small possible
 size changes using radiography.  The right hemidiaphragm is again elevated
 with pleural thickening and right apical paramediastinal consolidation with
 dilated airways, often seen after radiation therapy.  This appearance includes
 an unchanged small collection of air and fluid at the right lung apex. The
 only clear change is somewhat decreased aeration of the residual right lung
 which may be due to unilateral edema, lymphatic congestion or possibly an
 increased pleural effusion.  A dilated segment of small bowel is visualized in
 the epigastric region measuring up to 4 cm in diameter.  The patient is status
 post posterior thoracic spinal fusion with no clear change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Somewhat decreased aeration of the residual right lung but otherwise no
 significant change since earlier studies. Dilatation of small bowel in the
 epigastrium which is non-specific, not necessarily significant clinically,
 although correlation with clinical findings is recommended.
