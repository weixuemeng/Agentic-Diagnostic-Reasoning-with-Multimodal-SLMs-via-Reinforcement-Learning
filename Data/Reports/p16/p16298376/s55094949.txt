                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low.  Subtle patchy juxtahilar opacities are present on the right, with
 otherwise clear lungs.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right juxtahilar opacities, which may reflect patchy
 atelectasis, aspiration or focal pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs
 are suggested to document resolution.
