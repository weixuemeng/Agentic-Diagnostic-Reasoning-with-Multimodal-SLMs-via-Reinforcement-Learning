 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with urosepsis and intubated.  // Please confirm

 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild coarsening of the known
 left lower lobe parenchymal opacity, potentially reflecting pneumonia. The
 monitoring and support devices are unchanged, with the exception of the
 nasogastric tube that is now visible in its entire course, with the side-hole
 projecting approximately 5 cm be low the gastroesophageal junction.
 No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary
 edema.
