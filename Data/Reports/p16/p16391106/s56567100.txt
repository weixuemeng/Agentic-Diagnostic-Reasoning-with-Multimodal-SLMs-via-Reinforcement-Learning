                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, history of asthma,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The configuration
 suggests a left ventricular prominence, a finding which in conjunction with
 the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests systemic
 hypertension.  There is, however, no evidence of significant left atrial
 enlargement or pulmonary vascular congestion.  Similar as the patient had on
 previous examinations, there are some linear densities on the lung bases,
 apparently representing scar formations after previous infectious processes. 
 At the present time, there is no evidence of any new parenchymal infiltrate
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid
 accumulation.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area on the frontal
 view.  Thoracic spine demonstrates an accentuated kyphotic curvature with mild
 degree of degenerative changes, but no evidence of any significant vertebral
 body compression fracture.
 
 When comparison is made with the next previous examination of ___, the chest findings are stable in this ___-year-old female patient with
 cough.  There is no evidence of any acute pulmonary pneumonia presently.
