 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, worsening renal failure, evaluation for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 extent and severity of the pre-existing right lung opacities, and a newly
 appeared blunting of the right costophrenic sinus.  The finding suggests a
 newly appeared small right pleural effusion as well as an increase in severity
 of the pre-described pulmonary edema.
 
 On the left, the findings are constant.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  No
 evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  No change in
 appearance of the mediastinal structures.
