                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pulmonary fibrosis with shortness of breath
 and hypoxia.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of
 a left mid lung opacification which could represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting, however, this could also be seen with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  There are persistent bilateral interstitial opacities
 consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.  There is no interval change in heart
 size.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Left mid lung opacity could represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting; however, asymmetric pulmonary edema can also
 have this appearance.  Persistent interstitial opacities consistent with
 pulmonary fibrosis.
