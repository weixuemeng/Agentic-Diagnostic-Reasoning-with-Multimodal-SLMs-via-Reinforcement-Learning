                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low.  Minimal
 opacities within the lung bases may reflect dependent atelectasis.  The
 remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion,
 edema, or large effusions.  Apparent mediastinal widening is likely secondary
 to the AP technique.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
