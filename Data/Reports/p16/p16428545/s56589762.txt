                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year female with NSTEMI. Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates moderately
 well expanded and clear lungs with bibasilar atelectasis. Right middle lobe
 opacity with preservation of the diaphragm and heart borders is most
 consistent with epicardial fat. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild
 cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to patient positioning. Mediastinal
 contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
