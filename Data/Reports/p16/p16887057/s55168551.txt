 INDICATION:    ___F with slurred speech, cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to relatively low lung volumes and overlying soft
 tissues.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular markings although
 superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion is possible.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but likely accentuated due to the above factors and not likely
 changed from prior.  There is no confluent consolidation or large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular markings
 although superimposed vascular congestion is possible.
