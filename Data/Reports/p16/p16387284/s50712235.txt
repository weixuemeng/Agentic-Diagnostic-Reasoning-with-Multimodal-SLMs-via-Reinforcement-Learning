 and L arm since yesterday, constant. ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted and there is left basilar atelectasis. 
 Interval resolution of previously seen pleural effusions.  There is a right
 basilar opacity silhouetting the right cardiac margin which on the lateral
 seen anteriorly in could be due to mediastinal fat.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of prior pleural effusions.  Right basilar opacity could
 be due to prominent mediastinal fat given configuration on the lateral View
 though infection is difficult to entirely exclude.
