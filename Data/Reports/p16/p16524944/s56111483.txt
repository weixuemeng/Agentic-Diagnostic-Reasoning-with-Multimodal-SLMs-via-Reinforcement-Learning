                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Paraesophageal hernia, now after NG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The NG tube tip is at the level of the diaphragm, with the sidehole being
 within the hernia, with the tip being above the expected usual location of the
 gastroesophageal tube.
 
 Note is made that this second sternal wire is broken, a finding which appears
 to be changed at least since ___.
