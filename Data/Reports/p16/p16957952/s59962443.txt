                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain x20 minutes, please evaluate for pneumonia
 or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post CABG with intact sternotomy wires.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours appear to be stable with evidence of a tortuous
 aorta. There is stable mild cardiomegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There appears to be a subtle increase in opacification in the
 retrocardiac region, superimposed on a stable mild background of interstitial
 abnormality, best seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Stable diffuse increased interstitial markings with an interval increase in
 opacification in the retrocardiac region, best seen on the lateral view, which
 could be secondary to overlap of structures, however an acute infectious
 process is not excluded.
