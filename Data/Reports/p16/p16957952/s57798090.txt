                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, worse per patient report.  Evaluate for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous left basilar opacities do not have a correlate on the
 lateral radiograph and are likely minimal atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is not accompanied
 interstitial edema or pleural abnormality.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  The thoracic aorta is generally enlarged, very tortuous and
 moderately calcified but neither focally aneurysmal nor changed since at least
 ___.  The patient has had midline sternotomy and CABG.  A right cervical
 rib is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine include
 unchanged wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild left basal atelectasis; no pneumonia.
 
 2.  Chronic mild to moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous hypertension,
 but no pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Chronically enlarged atherosclerotic thoracic aorta, with no focal
 aneurysm.
