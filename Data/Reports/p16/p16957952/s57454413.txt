 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Recent urinary tract infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is a new moderate interstitial abnormality with peribronchial cuffing
 and indistinct vascular prominence, most consistent with mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular configuration.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are
 probably demineralized.  A mild anterior wedge compression deformity along the
 lower thoracic spine appears unchanged.  Mild degenerative changes along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine are also similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
