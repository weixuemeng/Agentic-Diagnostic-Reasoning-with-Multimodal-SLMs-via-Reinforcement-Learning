                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Flu with respiratory failure and COPD, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 An enteric tube traverses the stomach.  Two-lead pacemaker appears in place. 
 Previously noted bilateral increased pulmonary interstitial markings have
 improved, particularly on the left, suggesting improved pulmonary edema. 
 However, there are now increased bibasilar opacities suggesting either
 redistribution of dependent-edema or increased atelectasis or aspiration at
 the lung bases.  Bilateral small effusions have increased. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improvement in bilateral hilar opacities with increase in bibasilar opacities.
 These findings are suggestive of either redistribution of dependent edema or
 improvement of edema with increased bibasilar atelectasis or aspiration. A
 concurrent infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
