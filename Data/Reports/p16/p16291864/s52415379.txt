                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end colostomy and recurrent small bowel obstructions,
 now with sudden desaturation, here to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker with dual leads ending in the right
 atrium and right ventricle is unchanged.  The lungs are hyperexpanded with
 flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, compatible with COPD.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is increased pulmonary
 vascular congestion from ___ with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema from
 ___.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the prior study.
