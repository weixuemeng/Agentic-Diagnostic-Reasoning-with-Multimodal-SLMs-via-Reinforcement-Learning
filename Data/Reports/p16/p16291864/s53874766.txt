                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, decreased ileostomy output.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of
 the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There
 appears to be blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which may be
 related to COPD; however, trace pleural effusions may be present.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Again, there may be
 mild vascular congestion, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild vascular congestion, similar to prior.  Slight
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could relate to COPD, although
 trace pleural effusions are not excluded.
