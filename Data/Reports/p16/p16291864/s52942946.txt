                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with flu, assess for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 420.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4.5 to 5 cm
 above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  A dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given marked
 patient rotation on the current study.  There continues to be a diffuse
 bilateral predominantly interstitial process which has slightly worsened since
 the prior study suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema.  There is a layering
 left effusion and probably a smaller right effusion.  No pneumothorax.
