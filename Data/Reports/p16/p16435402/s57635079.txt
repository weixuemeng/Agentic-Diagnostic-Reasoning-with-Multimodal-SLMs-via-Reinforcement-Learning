                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lingula and carina and AP
 window.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to preoperative radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates a vague opacification
 projecting over the lingula in the region of the previously noted mass. 
 Finding is likely a combination of residual mass and a small, not unexpected
 hemorrhage.  No pneumothorax identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Minimal atelectatic changes are noted in the right lung
 base.  No osseous abnormality evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Faint opacification over lingula is combination
 of residual mass and small amount of unexpected postoperative hemorrhage.
