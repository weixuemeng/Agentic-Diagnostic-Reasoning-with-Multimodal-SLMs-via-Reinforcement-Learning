                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of lingular infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is opacity seen in the region of the lingula, corresponding to the
 consolidation seen on the prior chest CT.  Given the patient's symptoms and
 history of a lingular infiltrate, this most likely represents a residual area
 of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.  No additional foci of consolidation are
 noted.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The
 heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular opacity likely representing a residual focus of cryptogenic
 organizing pneumonia.  Recommend followup chest radiograph in ___ months
 following treatment to document resolution.
