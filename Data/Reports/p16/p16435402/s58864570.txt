 When compared to prior, there has been interval progression of the opacity in
 the left upper lobe.  Hazy opacity in the left lung base corresponds with
 lingular atelectasis versus scarring and superimposed left lower lobe
 ground-glass seen on prior chest CT.  Additional nodules previously described
 are not as clearly delineated by x-ray.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips in the
 right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
