                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with evidence of infiltrate on chest radiograph at 
 ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 19:03 and CT chest ___,
 ___, and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  As seen on the previous chest
 radiograph are ill-defined opacities within the left upper lobe and left lung
 base.  The right lung is clear apart from subsegmental atelectasis or scarring
 at the right lung base.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined opacities within the left upper lobe and left lung base are
 unchanged from previous radiograph, and likely worse or new compared to the
 most recent chest CT.  This could be due to an infectious etiology or
 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, given that ground-glass opacities have been
 seen on prior chest CTs in a waxing and waning fashion.
