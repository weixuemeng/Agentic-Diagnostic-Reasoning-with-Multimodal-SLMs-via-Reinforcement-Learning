                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and known
 resolving lingular opacity, now with worsening dyspnea, cough.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate slight interval
 increase in the opacity in the lingula.  There is a new area of atelectasis at
 the left base.  There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 which likely represents atalectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  No new or additional foci of consolidation are noted. 
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase of lingular opacity, and new area of
 atelectasis at bilateral bases.
