 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and sob  // pna reoccurance
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right mid lung opacity has decreased in the interval with possible minimal

 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Rightward deviation of the trachea is re- demonstrated, possibly due to
 enlarged left lobe of the thyroid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in right middle lobe opacity with possible minimal residual
 remaining.  No new focal consolidation seen.
 
 Re- demonstrated rightward deviation of the trachea which could be due to an
 enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, again, which can be further assessed on
 ultrasound if not previously evaluated.
