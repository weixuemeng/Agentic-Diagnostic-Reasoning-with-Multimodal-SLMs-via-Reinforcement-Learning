                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of COPD presenting with  sinusitis
 associated with shortness of breath and chest tightness.  // R/O PNA, R/O
 Pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are remarkable for
 widening of the left superior mediastinal contour with associated rightward
 deviation of the trachea above the thoracic inlet level.  This is likely due
 to left lobe thyroid enlargement with associated peripheral calcifications
 visualized.  . The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear except for
 a heterogeneous rib focus of consolidation within the right middle lobe.  . 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous right middle lobe opacity is concerning for developing
 infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Deviation of the proximal trachea is likely due to enlargement of left lobe of
 thyroid gland with possible partially calcified nodules.  If this has not been
 evaluated previously, thyroid ultrasound would be recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1.  Followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks after completion
 of antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution of right middle lobe process.
 
 2. Thyroid ultrasound to more fully evaluate suspected calcified left thyroid
 nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 08:24 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
