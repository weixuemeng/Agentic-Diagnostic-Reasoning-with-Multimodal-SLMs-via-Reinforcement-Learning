                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___. 
 Limited reference is made with a thyroid ultrasound dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The prior opacity in the right middle lobe is not clearly identified on
 today's exam.  The lungs are essentially clear.  No focal consolidation,
 edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size. The
 mediastinum is not widened.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly
 tortuous, likely related to left curvature of the thoracic spine.  Deviation
 of the trachea slightly to the right at the level of thoracic inlet is
 unchanged and is probably secondary to the enlarged left thyroid lobe with a
 nodule identified on the recent thyroid ultrasound on ___ for
 which consideration of the repeat fine-needle aspiration was recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal pneumonia.  Apparent interval resolution of the right middle lobe
 pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged right tracheal deviation at the level of thoracic inlet, likely
 secondary to the enlarged left thyroid lobe and calcified nodule identified on
 the recent thyroid ultrasound from ___.
