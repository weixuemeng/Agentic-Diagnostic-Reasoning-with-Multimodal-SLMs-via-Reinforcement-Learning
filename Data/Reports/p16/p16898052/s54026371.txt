                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post pigtail placement, please evaluate for
 improved pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of right-sided chest tube with pigtail
 projecting over the right apical region. Previously noted moderate to large
 right pneumothorax has essentially resolved, and there has been re-expansion
 of the right lung. Minimal residual opacity within the right lung base may
 reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Minimal
 streaky atelectasis also seen in the left lung base. The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits, and the pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right pigtail chest tube with resolution of previously
 noted right pneumothorax and re-expansion of the right lung. Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
