                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough for the past several days ago, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is increased
 hazy opacification of the left mid lung zone compared to the right, which
 likely corresponds to the left upper lobe on the corresponding lateral view
 and is concerning for developing infection.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy opacification of the left lung compared to the right
 concerning for developing infection.
