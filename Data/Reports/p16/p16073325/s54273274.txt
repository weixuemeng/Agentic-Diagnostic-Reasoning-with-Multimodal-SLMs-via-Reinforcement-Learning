                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval progression of interstitial
 pulmonary edema, currently consistent with severe interstitial edema
 associated with bilateral pleural effusions including in the fissure.  Heart
 size is unchanged including left ventricular enlargement.  Post-sternotomy
 wires are stable.  The right central venous line tip terminates in the right
 atrium.  Small amount of pleural effusion is better appreciated on the lateral
 view.
