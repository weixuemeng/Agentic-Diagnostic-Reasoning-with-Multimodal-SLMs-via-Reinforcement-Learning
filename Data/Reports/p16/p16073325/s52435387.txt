                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial flutter.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Right-sided dual lumen
 central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The thoracic aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 which are partially loculated laterally, right greater than left, appear
 slightly increased in size compared to the prior study.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms
 suggestive of underlying COPD.  Clips are again demonstrated within the right
 upper quadrant likely reflecting prior cholecystectomy.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, which are
 partially loculated laterally are slightly increased from the prior study. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
