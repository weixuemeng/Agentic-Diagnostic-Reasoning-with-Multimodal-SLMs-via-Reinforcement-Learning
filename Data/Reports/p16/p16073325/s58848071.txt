 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There are unchanged signs
 of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No larger pleural effusions.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position of the hemodialysis
 catheter and the sternal wires.
