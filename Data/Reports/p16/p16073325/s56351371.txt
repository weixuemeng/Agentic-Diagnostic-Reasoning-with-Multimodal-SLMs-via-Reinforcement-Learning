                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  A dialysis lies in situ.  Patient is status post sternotomy.  Midline
 sutures are in unchanged position.  Clips are projected at the level of the
 aortic hiatus in the right hypochondrium.  These are unchanged.
 
 There is cardiomegaly and there is evidence of generalized peribronchial
 cuffing.  Findings are consistent with pulmonary edema.  This is probably a
 little more pronounced than on the prior study.  There is an enlarging
 left-sided pleural reaction suggestive of developing effusion.  There is
 probably a small right effusion also.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 The findings are consistent with fluid overload.  The patient may be on
 dialysis and correlation with dry weight assessment would be appropriate. 
 Appearances are slightly worse than on the prior study.
