                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New onset of left upper extremity weakness and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-upright portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The patient is status
 post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There are patchy new multifocal opacities in both mid to lower lungs. Right
 lateral pleural thickening suggests small loculated effusion, probably
 unchanged.  The bones appear demineralized.  Prior left mid clavicle fracture
 site appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacities in the lower lungs, more striking on the right than left. 
 Pneumonia should be considered as a possible etiology in the appropriate
 setting although findings may be due to aspiration or atelectasis.
