                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aortic knob
 is calcified.  Mediastinal contours are similar.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  The
 right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged while the left pleural
 effusion appears minimally increased in size.  Bibasilar opacities are worse
 in the interval, likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized. 
 Deformity of the left mid clavicle is compatible with a remote fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly
 increased in size on the left.  Worsening bibasilar opacities, likely
 compressive atelectasis.
