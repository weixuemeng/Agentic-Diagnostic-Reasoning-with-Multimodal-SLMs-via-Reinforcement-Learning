                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified. 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis.  There is upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension without frank congestive heart failure.  There is no free air. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity
 suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension, mild cardiomegaly, and slight
 bibasilar atelectasis suspected, but no evidence for pneumonia.
