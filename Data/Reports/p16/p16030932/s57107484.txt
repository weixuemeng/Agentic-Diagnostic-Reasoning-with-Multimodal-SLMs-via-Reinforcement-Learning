                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall on hemodialysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lumen right-sided subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in
 the proximal right atrium.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. 
 There is a small left pleural effusion, as seen previously, with focal opacity
 in the left lung base potentially reflective of compressive atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion, similar to the previous study, with continued
 left basilar opacity potentially reflective of compressive atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.
