                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with palpitations, occ sob.  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  There are new increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Infrahilar likely retrocardiac
 opacity best seen on the lateral projection could reflect pneumonia.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Heart size is increased now with mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Aortic
 arch is calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New mild to moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions and
 mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Infrahilar, likely retrocardiac, opacity best seen on the lateral
 projection could reflect pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
