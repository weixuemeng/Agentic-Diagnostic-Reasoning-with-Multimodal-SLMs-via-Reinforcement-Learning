                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute onset aphasia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent left base opacity which could be due to consolidation due
 to infection or aspiration.  Underlying left pleural effusion with atelectasis
 could be present.  The right lung is grossly clear aside from pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No right pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Large-bore dual-lumen right central venous catheter terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction/right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left base opacity raises concern for consolidation, underlying
 pleural effusion with atelectasis may also be present.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
