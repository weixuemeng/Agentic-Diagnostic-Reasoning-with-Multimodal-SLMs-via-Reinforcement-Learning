                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction
 of the SVC and right atrium.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The
 aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is improved
 compared to the previous study.  Moderate size left and small right bilateral
 pleural effusions also appear somewhat improved.  Opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis.  Infection in the left lung
 base is not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Remote left mid clavicular
 fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved in the interval with decreased
 size of moderate left and small right bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection in the left
 lung base is difficult to exclude.
