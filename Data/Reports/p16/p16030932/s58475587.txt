                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Interval placement of central venous line.  Bradycardia and
 hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___
 obtained approximately four hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  There is interval increase in prominence of the
 vasculature consistent with increased mild-to-moderate edema.  A new more
 focal opacity at the right base may represent a combination of engorged
 vessels and overlapping structures, though aspiration or a developing
 infection is a possibility.  There may be a trace right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild cardiomegaly and calcification of the
 aortic arch.  A right-sided central venous line has been placed with tip in
 the upper SVC.
