                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with shortness of breath and peripheral
 edema and history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased right basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise,
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Pulmonary vasculature appears
 engorged.  There is a likely small right pleural effusion but no pulmonary
 edema.  Tortuosity of the aorta remains unchanged.
 
 Severe erosive changes of the humeral heads are again visualized but the
 shoulders are not dislocated.  Multiple wedge deformities of the thoracic
 vertebral body are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild congestive heart failure.
 2.  Right lower lobe opacity could be atelectasis. However, pneumonia must be
 excluded in the proper clinical setting.
