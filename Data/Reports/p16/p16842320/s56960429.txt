 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 6:36 AM
  INDICATION:  Flank pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
  
  COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
  
  FINDINGS:  Aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear. 
  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
  normal.  There are no pleural abnormalities.  Deformities of the humeral head
  is unchanged and may relate to prior trauma.  Anterior wedging of a mid
  thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
  
  IMPRESSION:
  1.  Bibasilar minimal atelectasis, less likely pneumonia or aspiration
  pneumonitis.
  2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.

 INDICATION:  Flank pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has increased and lung vasculature is more engorged, and
 there is probably a new small, right pleural effusion, but there is no
 pulmonary edema.  Contours of the tortuous aorta are unchanged.  There are no
 pleural abnormalities.  Despite severe, erosive degenerative deformities of
 the humeral heads, the shoulders are not dislocated. It is not possible to say
 whether there has been progression of multiple wedge deformities of the
 thoracic vertebra.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Mild congestive heart failure.
