                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Agitation, confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. 
 Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in right atrium and right
 ventricle is present.  Curvilinear calcification on the lateral view along the
 left atrial and left ventricular contours is likely pericardial in etiology. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but likely accentuated due to the low lung
 volumes.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy and linear opacities within the lung bases are
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Mild loss of height of a mid/low thoracic vertebral body is noted. 
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Probable pericardial
 calcifications.
