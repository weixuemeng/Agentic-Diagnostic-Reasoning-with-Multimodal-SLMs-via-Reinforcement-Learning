 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:11 PM
  ET tube is 4.3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses into the stomach with
  the tip in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Right internal jugular
  central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. Bilateral airspace
  opacities, right greater than left, likely reflect a component of pulmonary
  edema although a superimposed infection is difficult to exclude. There are
  small bilateral pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There
  is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cardiac arrest  // ? interval change      ?
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
 region of the pylorus.  An intended esophageal temperature probe ends in the
 midline at the level of the aortic arch and could be in either the upper
 esophagus or airway.  Right internal jugular line ends in the low SVC.
 
 Severe somewhat asymmetric bilateral pulmonary consolidation more perihilar on
 the right and more the basal on the left could be pulmonary edema or because
 of the asymmetry massive pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged but not appreciably changed since ___.  At least a small right
 pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax. Any important findings
 merit direct notification will be based on the results of the subsequent chest
 radiograph available to review at the time of this transcription.
