                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Currently on treatment for aspiration pneumonia presenting with
 increased oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Findings are overall very similar to the prior study aside from
 some improvement in aeration of the left mid lung.  There are suspected
 pleural effusions, probably at least small-to-moderate in size, with layering.
 Hazy opacification of each lung suggests pulmonary edema.  Vague opacification
 is greater in the lower than upper lungs, however, and coinciding etiologies
 such as recent pneumonia or aspiration are not excluded.
