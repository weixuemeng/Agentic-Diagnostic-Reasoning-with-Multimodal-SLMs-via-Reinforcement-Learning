 line ends in the mid to low superior vena cava. Bilateral patchy airspace
 opacities most likely represent pulmonary edema. There are bilateral small
 pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are widened and there is moderate
 cardiomegaly.

 most likely represent pulmonary edema, however, infection cannot be excluded. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
