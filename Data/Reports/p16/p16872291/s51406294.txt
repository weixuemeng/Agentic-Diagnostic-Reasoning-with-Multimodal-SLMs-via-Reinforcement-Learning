                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:53
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CRI, CHF, altered mental status with
 concern for pneumonia.  Evaluate pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 Followup right chest film ___ at 9:53 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished.  Overall, when compared to multiple
 previous studies dating back to ___, there does appear to be increasing
 interstitial prominence and fullness in the perihilar vessels suggesting an
 element of mild interstitial edema.  Streaky opacities at both bases are again
 noted, likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No large pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen,
 although the patient's mandible obscures part of the apices.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation on
 the current study, although the heart likely remains stably enlarged.
