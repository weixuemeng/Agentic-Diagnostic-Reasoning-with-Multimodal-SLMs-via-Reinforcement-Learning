                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia and recent falls.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Lung apices are obscured by the patient's chin. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, compatible with edema.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities are consistent with atelectasis.  The left costophrenic angle is
 obscured, compatible with a small effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema, worsened since prior, with probable small left
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar opacities, compatible with atelectasis.
 2.  Stable mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
