                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 16:34.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing angina, question aspiration
 or possible pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 16:34 were obtained and
 compared to prior study of ___ at 13:52.
 
 Please note that the lateral film has overlying motion limiting its utility. 
 However, the technologist noted that these are the best possible images that
 could be obtained at this time.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in lung volumes with residual streaky patchy
 opacities in both lung bases, likely reflecting atelectasis and/or resolving
 edema, less likely an infectious process.  There is a suggestion of pulmonary
 venous hypertension.  Heart remains mildly enlarged.  Overall mediastinal
 contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.  Bibasilar
 pneumonia would be less likely.  No pneumothorax.  There is widening of the
 acromiohumeral distance on the right glenohumeral joint and the humeral head
 appears to be approximated only with the inferior portion of the glenoid. 
 These findings would suggest subluxation.  If this is of clinical concern,
 further imaging evaluation with a dedicated shoulder series could be
 performed.
