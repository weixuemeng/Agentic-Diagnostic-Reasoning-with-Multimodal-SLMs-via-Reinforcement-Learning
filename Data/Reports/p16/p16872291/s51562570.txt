                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:52.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of hypertension, diabetes, and
 chronic renal insufficiency, increasing angina.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 8:00 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 13:52, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  However, the heart remains moderately enlarged.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is indistinct and there are bibasilar airspace
 opacities.  These findings most likely reflect moderate pulmonary edema,
 although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  The patient's
 mandible obscures the apices.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
