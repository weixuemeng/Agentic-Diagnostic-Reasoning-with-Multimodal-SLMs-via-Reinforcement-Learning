                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough for two weeks, suggested fevers, chills, and
 weakness.  Coarse breath sounds, worse on the left.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Right basilar
 opacity may represent atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob remains
 calcified, similar in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Right base opacity may be due to atelectasis, although infectious process is
 not excluded.
