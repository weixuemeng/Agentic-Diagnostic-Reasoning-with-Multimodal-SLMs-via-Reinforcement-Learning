                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Slightly low lung volumes contribute to exaggeration of the cardiac
 size as well contribute to subsegmental atelectasis and increased pulmonary
 markings.  No focal opacities are present that are concerning for pneumonia. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  No pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Probable
 background hyperinflations/COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Given low lung volumes, no evidence of pneumonia. Probable mild
 cardiomegaly and possible mild vascular plethora.
