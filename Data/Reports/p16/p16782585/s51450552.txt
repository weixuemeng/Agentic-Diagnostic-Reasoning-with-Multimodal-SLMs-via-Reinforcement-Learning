                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with sarcoid and shortness of breath and
 cough.  Evaluate for new process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exists,
 however, rather marked mostly interstitial reticular abnormalities involving
 mostly the upper lobe areas, fading out in the mid lung fields and practically
 absence in the lung bases where an apparent hypertranslucency is noted.  Acute
 parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  The hilar areas are poorly
 defined and somewhat distorted, likely related to the chronic interstitial
 changes.
 
 These findings are compatible with stage II of sarcoid and can explain
 patient's symptoms. Scrutiny of our records did not find any previous chest
 examination available for direct comparison.  Thus, question if patient has
 new processes, must await arrival of previous chest examinations obtained at
 other institutions.
