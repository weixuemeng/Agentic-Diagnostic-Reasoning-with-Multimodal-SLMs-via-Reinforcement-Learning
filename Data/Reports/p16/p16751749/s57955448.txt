                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs with dates
 ranging from ___ to ___, 3 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 endotracheal tube with tip 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube seen
 coursing into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax identified. 
 Otherwise, unchanged exam with hyperinflation of lungs and severe bullous
 emphysematous changes identified in the upper lungs, particularly on the left.
 Increased opacity at the lateral right lung base thought to represent scarring
 versus infectious process on prior study is better evaluated on current study
 and appears to be consistent with scarring, unchanged from ___.  No
 pleural effusions evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post intubation with tip 6 cm above carina.  No
 pneumothorax.  Relative opacity at lateral right lung base thought to
 represent scarring versus infectious process on prior study is better
 evaluated on current study and appears to be consistent with scarring,
 unchanged from ___.
