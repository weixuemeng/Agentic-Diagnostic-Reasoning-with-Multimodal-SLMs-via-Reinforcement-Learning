                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy and chest tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two frontal views of the chest show greater opacification in the
 left lower lung which could represent new pneumonia, less likely asymmetric
 edema because edema has not worsened elsewhere.  Focal areas of possible
 hemorrhage in the right suprahilar and left lateral suprahilar lungs are
 unchanged, as well as the likely hematoma along the track of the right pleural
 tube.  Heart size normal.  No detectable pneumothorax.  Extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema unchanged.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
