                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers and hypotension.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained followed by repeat
 radiographs approximately one hour afterwards.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___
 obtained approximately 13 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  On initial radiograph, a line near the right apex is
 seen. This was further evaluated by repositioning and repeat radiograph
 demonstrating the absence of this line which most likely represented a skin
 fold.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The examination overall is unchanged
 with known severe emphysema and multifocal opacities.  Extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema is also not significantly changed.  Right-sided chest tube,
 right-sided central venous line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged.
