                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement in a patient with COPD substantial
 subcutaneous air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating
 in the stomach.  There is no change in the appearance of the right chest tube,
 left subclavian line and ET tube.  Extensive subcutaneous air collections are
 widespread throughout the entire chest.  Bilateral focal consolidations within
 the lungs appear unchanged.
