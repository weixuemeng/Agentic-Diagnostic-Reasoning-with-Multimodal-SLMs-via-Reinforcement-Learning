                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new pleuritic pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture or other abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no
 fracture is identified, this study is suboptimal for detection of rib
 fractures.  If there is further clinical concern, dedicated rib views should
 be obtained.
