                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF exacerbation  // eval pulmonary
 congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs of ___, there has been interval
 placement of an ET tube, which terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild
 edema is similar to prior.   Asymmetric enlargement of the right hila may
 represent vascular congestion due to left heart failure versus acute pulmonary
 embolism.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Asymmetric
 enlargement of the right hila may represent vascular congestion due to left
 heart failure, however this also can be seen with acute pulmonary embolism,
 which would need to be assessed with CT if clinically indicated.
