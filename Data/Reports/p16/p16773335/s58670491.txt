 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HF, PNA  // eval for PNA, HF progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are accompanied by near
 resolution of interstitial edema.  Worsening right middle lobe opacity results
 in partial obscuration of the right heart border and could be due to
 developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Slight worsening of
 left retrocardiac opacification and apparent slight increase in size of a
 small left pleural effusion.  No other relevant changes.
