                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CAD, worsening tachypnea, assess pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient, bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right
 side, adjacent atelectasis, and vascular congestion are stable.  There are no
 other interval changes.
