  Increased opacity at the right base, likely atelectasis.  Otherwise, better
  aeration in left upper lobe, likely secondary to decreased pulmonary edema.
  Position of support devices unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Drop in hematocrit.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present. The carina is not well visualized, but the ETT tip
 likely lies approximately 17 mm above the carina, somewhat low.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off the film.  Multiple lines and
 tubes overlie the chest and upper abdomen, which may represent additional
 chest tubes and mediastinal drains.  
 
 A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, lead tips over left atrium and
 left ventricle. The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged compared with earlier the same day (14:55 pm).  There
 is some patchy retrocardiac density, grossly similar to prior.  There is new
 opacity at the right base, likely representing some plate-like atelectasis,
 with possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) ETT tip ~ 17 mm above the carina, though the carina itself is not well
 visualized.  Clinical correlation regarding possible retraction is requested.
 
 2) Cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly unchanged.  New plate-like atelectasis
 at the right base.
