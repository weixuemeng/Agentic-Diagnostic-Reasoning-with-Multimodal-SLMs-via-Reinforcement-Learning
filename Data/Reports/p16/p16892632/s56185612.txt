                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, readmitted for shortness of breath and
 cellulitis, evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pleural
 effusion on the right has decreased in extent.  The effusion on the left is
 unchanged and causes moderate atelectasis of the left lower lobe as well as
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.  The extent of the effusions is
 better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The size of
 the cardiac silhouette, and of atelectasis at the right lung bases, is
 unchanged.  Unchanged minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Constant
 course of the pacemaker wires, unchanged position of the left pectoral
 pacemaker.
