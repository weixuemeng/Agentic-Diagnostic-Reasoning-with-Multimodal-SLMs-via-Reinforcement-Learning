                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness, cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight increased opacity at the left lung base, which could in part relate to
 overlying soft tissue, though underlying consolidation may be present.  The
 right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Again seen is a dual-lead left-sided
 pacemaker with leads extending to the expected positions in the right atrium
 and right ventricle, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity could be due to pneumonia.
