                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable, unremarkable, except for some
 prominence of the left atrium.  Lungs are clear.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus is unchanged since chest radiograph obtained yesterday but
 new as compared to ___.  Since it also has been shown on ___ radiograph, it is most likely consistent with the persistent findings
 of minimal pleural effusion on the left, reason unclear.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
