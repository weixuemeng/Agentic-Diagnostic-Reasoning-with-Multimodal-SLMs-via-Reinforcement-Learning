                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The chest is hyperinflated.  A
 persistent meniscoid appearance to each posterior costophrenic sulcus may be
 related to pleural thickening although very small effusions are hard to
 exclude.  The lungs appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
