 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is new right upper lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration
 pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis has increased.  Mild vascular congestion is
 stable.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.  NG tube tip is out
 of view, below the diaphragm.  Widened mediastinum due to projection and
 engorgement of the vessels is unchanged.
