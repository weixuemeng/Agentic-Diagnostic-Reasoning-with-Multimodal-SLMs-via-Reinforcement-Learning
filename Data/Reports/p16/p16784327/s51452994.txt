                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nonverbal patient from outside facility with poor documentation,
 now with altered mental status.  The patient has history of cancer of unknown
 variety.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.  CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been a dramatic decrease in size of previously seen left
 paramediastinal mass from ___.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are now within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, as before.  Hyperlucency of the lung apices suggests emphysema. 
 Coarse interstitial lung markings, most pronounced in the right lung base
 suggest underlying interstitial changes, which appear chronic.  There is no
 large pleural effusion.  Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited due to soft
 tissues of the neck overlying the lung apices.  There are multiple rib
 fractures bilaterally, which appear recent without significant callus
 formation.  Mildly displaced fractures involve the right posterior sixth,
 seventh and eighth rib.  A minimally displaced fracture involve the right
 lateral ninth rib and possibly a nondisplaced fracture involving the right
 tenth rib.  Nondisplaced fractures of the left eighth and ninth ribs
 moderately are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dramatically decreased size of previously seen large left paramediastinal
 mass from ___.
 2.  Multiple displaced and nondisplaced rib fractures as detailed above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 10:45 a.m. on ___, approximately 15 minutes after
 discovery of findings.
