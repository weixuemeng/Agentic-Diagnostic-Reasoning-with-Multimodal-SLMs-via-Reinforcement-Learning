                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // ?ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are somewhat low. Infrahilar haziness on the right appears
 slightly more prominent compared to prior studies, and is present posteriorly
 on the lateral view, possibly reflecting pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More conspicuous right infrahilar haziness could potentially represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
