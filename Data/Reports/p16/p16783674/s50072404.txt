                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible aspiration, for Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of the Dobbhoff tube is extremely difficult to see.  It
 appears to extend below to the mid or lower body of the stomach, before
 coiling back on itself so that the tip lies in the upper stomach.  The study
 of the abdomen would be helpful for better evaluation.
 
 Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart and fullness of pulmonary vessels.
