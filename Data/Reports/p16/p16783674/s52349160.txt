                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, transfer from outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph dated ___ at 19:  7.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 2.7 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube tip can only be traced to the level of the distal esophagus,
 and likely should be advanced.  The patient is status post median sternotomy. 
 Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the heart which is
 likely mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is distinct.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though aspiration
 or infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis
 but aspiration or infection is not excluded.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube is slightly low lying, terminating approximately 2.7 cm
 from the carina.  Orogastric tube tip can only be traced to the distal
 esophagus, and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
