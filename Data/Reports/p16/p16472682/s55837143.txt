                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent intubation, please evaluate for pneumonia or interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is related to patient
 rotation.  Left-sided central venous catheter with tip at the distal SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Nasogastric tube, seen coiled in
 oropharynx on next preceding study, is seen passing into stomach and out of
 view with the side port not definitively seen. Interval increased
 opacification of the bilateral lung bases is likely a combination of worsening
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Stable minimally asymmetrically increased
 density of the right middle lobe corresponds with area of increased
 atelectasis on the ___ CT.  No pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube appears stable in position. On the prior study, the
 nasogastric tube appears to be coiled in the oropharynx.  Please correspond
 with visual inspection.
 2.  Increased basilar opacities likely reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and worsening pleural effusions.
 
 ___ attempted to communicate these findings to ___ at
 09:45 on ___ via telephone.
