                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pigtail catheter for
 pleural effusion drainage in place.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid-to-low SVC.  Left pigtail catheter
 is in place with no interval accumulation of left pleural effusion.  There is
 interval progression of right perihilar opacities that might reflect
 atelectasis or aspiration.  Rapid development of pneumonia would be less
 likely.  The patient continues to be in mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Right pleural effusion is noted, small, partially imaged.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
