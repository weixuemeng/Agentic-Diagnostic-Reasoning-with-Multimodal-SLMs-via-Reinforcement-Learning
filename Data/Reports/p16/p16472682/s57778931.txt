 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube ends approximately 3 cm above the carina and is appropriate

 off the radiographic view.  Central line through the right internal jugular
 approach ends approximately at the level of lower SVC.  Since prior radiograph
 dated ___, there is very mild increase in the mediastinal and
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased retrocardiac density suggesting left
 lower lung atelectasis and mild left pleural effusions are persisting.  Heart
 size is normal.
