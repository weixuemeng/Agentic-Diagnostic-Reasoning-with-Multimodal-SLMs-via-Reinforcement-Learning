 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral lower lobe opacities with
 possible left-sided effusion.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 
 Prominence of the hila could relate to vascular engorgement.  A right-sided
 PICC line terminates with its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New bibasilar opacities with a left-sided effusion could be related to
 infection and/or aspiration.  Prominence of the hila could relate to vascular
 engorgement.
