                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube pulled, assess placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying fundus.  The sideport lies in the
 region of the GE junction, possibly immediately beyond it.  A left IJ central
 line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is cardiomegaly, CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, and
 small-to-moderate bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Compared with ___, the CHF findings and effusions are
 probably similar, allowing for differences in positioning.
