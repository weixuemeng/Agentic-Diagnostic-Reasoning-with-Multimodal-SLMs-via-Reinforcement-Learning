  Mild pulmonary edema is similar to prior. Previously present focal opacities
  within the right lung have not recurred on the current study. Left midlung
  opacity is not well appreciated on the current study. Left basilar
  retrocardiac opacity is slightly worse, which may reflect atelectasis or
  consolidation. Right internal jugular line in unchanged position.
