                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of left-sided pleural
 effusion, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable AP single view chest examination of ___.  Heart size and
 mediastinal structures grossly unaltered.  Same holds for the previously
 identified bilateral diaphragmatic linear calcifications compatible with the
 old asbestos exposure.  Left-sided pleural thickenings both in apical area as
 well as lateral wall and left base remain unchanged and the presence of a
 small caliber pigtail ending catheter on the left base presumably draining the
 pleural space appears unchanged.  No pneumothorax can be identified.  No new
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable changes with evidence of left-sided pleural
 effusion.
