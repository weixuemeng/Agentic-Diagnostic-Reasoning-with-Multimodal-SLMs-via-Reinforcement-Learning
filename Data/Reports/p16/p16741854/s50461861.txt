                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation, status post arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen coursing into the right main stem bronchus with
 complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  Recommend withdrawal by
 approximately 6 cm.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, terminating in the region of the expected location of the proximal
 stomach.  Bilateral diaphragmatic plaques are seen and evidence of pleural
 plaques, most consistent with prior asbestos exposure.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mainstem bronchus intubation with complete opacification of
 the left hemithorax.  Repositioning recommended.  Subsequent chest CT
 demonstrated that the ETT had been retracted and terminated above the level of
 the carina.
