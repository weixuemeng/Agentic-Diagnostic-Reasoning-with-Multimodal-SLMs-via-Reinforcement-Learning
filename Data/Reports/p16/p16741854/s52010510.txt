 pneumothorax.  There is a stable left apical density which may represent
 pleural fluid and/or thickening.  Calcified pleural plaques are likely related

 stable with aortic calcifications.  There appears to be slight interval
 worsening of diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema compared to the prior exam.

 Small left basal pneumothorax at the site of the Pleur-X catheter.  Slight
 interval worsening of the bilateral pulmonary edema.
