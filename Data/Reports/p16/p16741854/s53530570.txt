                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Respiratory failure ET tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:34.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen coursing into the proximal right main
 stem bronchus with near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  Again,
 repositioning is recommended. On the subsequent CT the ET tube was seen to be
 above the level of the carina.  There has been slight improvement in aeration
 of the left upper lung.  The right lung is clear.  Enteric tube course below
 the level of the diaphragm into at least the proximal aspect of the stomach. 
 The cardiac silhouette at the left aspect is not well assessed due to the left
 hemithorax opacification.  Bilateral diaphragmatic plaques again suggest the
 prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube extends into the proximal right main stem
 bronchus.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 5 cm.  On subsequent chest
 CT, the endotracheal tube was seen to be repositioned to terminate above the
 level of the carina.  There is slight improvement in aeration of the left
 upper hemithorax.
