                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Left chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate left pleural effusion is again seen.  Again, relative
 ground-glass opacity is seen projecting over the left upper lung similar to
 possibly minimally increased since the prior study given differences in
 technique.  There may be a subtle right base opacity versus confluence of
 shadows.  Bilateral left greater than right pleural plaques are seen including
 bilateral diaphragmatic plaques and plaques overlying the left upper
 hemithorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There remains patchy left base retrocardiac opacity which could
 be due to atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left pleural effusion which appears slightly increased. 
 Persistent left lung ground-glass opacity which appears slightly increased. 
 Findings may be due to infection superimposed on calcified pleural plaques;
 however, given history of asbestos exposure, recommend further evaluation with
 possible thoracentesis if not performed since the prior study.
