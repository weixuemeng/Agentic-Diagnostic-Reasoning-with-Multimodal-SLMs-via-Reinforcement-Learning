                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with question infiltrate seen on PET from ___, continues to have chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, PET-CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral pleural
 plaques, more confluent on the left, which result in increased opacity of the
 left hemithorax.  The ground-glass opacification seen within the left upper
 lobe is not definitely appreciated on the current study, though may be
 obscured by overlying pleural plaques.  There is no pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains top normal in size, with note
 made of coronary arterial stents.  Mediastinal contours are normal, with the
 exception of calcification of the aortic arch.  Previously noted mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is not well seen.  A radiodense structure in the right upper
 quadrant may reflect contrast within a colonic diverticulum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of pleural plaques, with the left upper lobe
 abnormality from ___ not well seen, probably resolved.
 
 Findings were discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at 5:15 p.m.
