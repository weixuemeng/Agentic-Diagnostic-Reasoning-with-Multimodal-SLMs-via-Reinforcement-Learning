                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for CHF or other pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ as
 well as PET-CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unchanged
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Stable cardiac enlargement noted.  There is
 increased distribution and density of the previously noted left upper lobe
 ground glass opacification. New retrocardiac opacification  may represent
 atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  In addition, there is a new small left pleural effusion.  Multiple
 densely calcified pleural plaques are again noted and may contribute to the
 appearance of lung parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacification of the left upper lobe with new
 retrocardiac opacification and small left pleural effusion.  Findings may be
 attributable to a combination of pleural plaques and left lower lobe
 pneumonia.  However, given the increased risk of malignancy due to asbestosis
 exposure and evolution of left upper lobe findings, recommend further
 evaluation, possibly with thoracocentesis.
 
 ___ placed these findings on the critical communications dashboard
 at 14:05 on ___ at time of discovery.
