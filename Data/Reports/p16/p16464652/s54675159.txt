 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Again seen are multifocal consolidations, more pronounced in the left lobe and
 right upper lobe since prior study.   There is diffuse interstitial
 prominence, likely due to the known lymphangitic metastatic disease.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates in appropriate position. Nasogastric tube is in
 the stomach. Left subclavian line terminates in the right atrium.  Distended
 intestines are again partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Worsening multifocal consolidations
 2. Stable interstitial disease due to lymphangitic metastatic disease.
