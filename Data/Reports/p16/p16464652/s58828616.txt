                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest, two views.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath. History and pancreatic
 cancer on chemo  // r/o PNA, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___.  The
 study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are relatively well expanded, with persistent micronodular and
 interstitial opacities, compatible with known lymphangitis carcinomatosis, not
 significantly changed since the prior chest radiograph. There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or new focal consolidation. A left chest wall
 port terminates in the upper right atrium. Gaseous distension of upper mid
 abdominal bowel loops is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of widespread interstitial and micronodular opacities,
 compatible with known lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  No evidence of focal
 pneumonia.
