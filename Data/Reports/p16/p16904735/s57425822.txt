                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, CHF, several months of anasarca. 
 Crackles in the lingula and right lower lobe.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Obscuration of right
 costophrenic angle could reflect trace pleural fluid or pleural thickening. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  Trace right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
