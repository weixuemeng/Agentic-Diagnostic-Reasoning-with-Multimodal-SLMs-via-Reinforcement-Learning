                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough for one and half weeks, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  No definite signs
 of pneumonia.  The previously noted right pleural effusion appears to have
 resolved in the interval.  Heart size is stable and within normal limits. 
 However, there is relative prominence of the pulmonary hila bilaterally, which
 is stable, though of unclear etiology.  The possibility of engorged
 vasculature is raised.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the pulmonary hila could be secondary to vascular
 prominence.  Please correlate clinically.  Consider CT on a non-emergent basis
 to further assess.
