                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient, followup question pneumonia.
 
 Compared was made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Large opacities in the left lower
 hemithorax are a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation. 
 This consolidation could be atelectasis or pneumonia, grossly unchanged from
 prior study allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Right
 lower lobe atelectasis has increased.  Mild vascular congestion is unchanged. 
 Widened mediastinum is stable.  Left IJ catheter tip remains at the confluence
 of the brachiocephalic veins.  Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the right atrium as
 before.  There is no pneumothorax.
