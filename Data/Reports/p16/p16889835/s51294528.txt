 COMPARISON:  The comparison is made with prior studies including ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The apparent density in the right lung base on the earlier study is not
 clearly visualized on today's exam and likely represented overlap of normal
 structures.
 There are some very tiny nodular densities in both lungs which could represent
 vessels on end, but small granuloma cannot be completely excluded, especially
 in the setting of a positive PPD.  Further evaluation with chest CT would be
 recommended.
 There is no pneumothorax, effusion, dense consolidation or CHF.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  A reported of the above findings was sent via the InfoRadiology
 Non-Urgent Critical Findings Dashboard by Dr. ___ on ___ at 2:20 PM,
 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  There are some very tiny nodular densities in both lungs
 which could represent vessels on end, but small granuloma cannot be completely
 excluded, especially in the setting of a positive PPD. Further evaluation with
 chest CT would be recommended.
