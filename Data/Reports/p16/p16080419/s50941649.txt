                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  None given.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is similar tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm with slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but
 similar to more remote prior study and probably due to sequelae of prior
 pneumonia and chest tube placement as given in the history.  There is also
 slight pleural thickening along the right apex that does not appear changed. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
