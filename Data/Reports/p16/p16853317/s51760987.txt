                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia, sepsis, now 3 weeks post x-ray,
 status post levofloxacin 1 week ago  // pneumonia follow-up
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent but improved patchy opacities in the right upper and middle lobes
 since ___.  Persistent tenting of the right and right hemidiaphragm may
 reflect pleural thickening and/or scarring, sequelae of prior infection or
 process causing volume loss such as fibrotic changes.  There is trace fluid in
 the minor fissure, which is elevated, suggesting significant right upper lobe
 volume loss or untold history of prior lung resection, although suture
 material is not visualized.  Rounded opacity in the right hilum persists. 
 Severe emphysematous left upper lobe predominant changes persist with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  No left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous, unchanged.  The heart is normal in
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent but interval improvement in right upper lobe predominant
 opacities with evidence of significant volume loss.  Chest CT is recommended
 to further evaluate given the lack of complete resolution of radiographic
 findings.
 2.  Background emphysema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 15:13 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
