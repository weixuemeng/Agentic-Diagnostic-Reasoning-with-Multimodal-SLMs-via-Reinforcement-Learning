                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dysphagia, aspiration. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to OSH chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest radiograph evaluation, particularly the left heart border, is
 limited due to patient rotation .  Within this limitation, there appears to be
 an opacity projecting over the left heart border, possibly representing
 lingular pneumonia.  Coarsened interstial markings evident in the lung bases,
 may reflect differences in technique.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 evident.  The patient is status post CABG with stable cardiac enlargement. 
 Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Significant thoracolumbar
 scoliosis with associated degenerative changes identified. Deformity of left
 clavicle likely due to prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unable to assess lingula due to rotation. No pneumonia evident.
