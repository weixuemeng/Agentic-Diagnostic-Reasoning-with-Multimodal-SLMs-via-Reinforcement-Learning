                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of right upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma
 complicated by SVC syndrome, presenting with unresponsiveness, acute
 respiratory failure and hypotension, admitted to MICU intubated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off the film.  A left
 subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  
 
 There is essentially complete opacification of the right hemithorax.  Clip
 noted in the upper right lung.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, though on the right, it is
 considerably obscured by the right chest opacification.  On the left, there is
 upper zone re-distribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting CHF
 with interstitial edema.  There is also left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, slightly progressed compared with ___ at 4:40 a.m.  No
 gross left effusion, though small left effusion would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially complete opacification of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Probable CHF with interstitial edema and left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, both of which have progressed compared with one day earlier.
