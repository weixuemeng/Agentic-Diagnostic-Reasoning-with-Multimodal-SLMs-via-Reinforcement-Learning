                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bilateral lower extremity edema, metastatic
 renal cell carcinoma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. Lung volumes
 are low. Heart size is borderline enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Innumerable diffuse pulmonary nodules are re-
 demonstrated, the largest in the right upper lobe measuring up to 13 mm.
 Patchy left lower lobe opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Multiple clips are re- demonstrated in the left
 upper abdomen compatible with prior nephrectomy.  Known osseous metastasis
 involving the T12 vertebral body is not well visualized on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left lower lobe opacity likely atelectasis. Innumerable pulmonary
 metastases, relatively unchanged.
