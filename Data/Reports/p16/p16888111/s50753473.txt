                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ESRD from OSH for hematuria, complaints of
 cough, on auscultation left posterior rhonchi
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits.  The aorta remains unfolded.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, and pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Low lung volumes are present with patchy opacities in the lung bases, findings
 which may reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
