 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an enteric tube the traverses the
 diaphragm and its tip is in the stomach, but the side port is in the region of
 the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced several more centimeters
 to lie within the stomach lumen.  The right PICC line is overall unchanged in
 position the with its tip ending in the lower SVC.  Low bilateral lung volumes
 are overall unchanged.  Moderate to severe bilateral atelectasis is also
 overall unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is overall similar.  The heart is
 normal in size.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube side port is probably at the GE junction could be advanced slightly
 more to be in the stomach.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
