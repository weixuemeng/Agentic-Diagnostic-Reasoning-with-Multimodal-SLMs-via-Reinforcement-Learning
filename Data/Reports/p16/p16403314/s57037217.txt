                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The degree of free air has probably decreased somewhat.  There is
 similar elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Left basilar opacity has
 improved substantially.  There is persistent right middle lobe opacification,
 however, and basilar opacity in the right lower lobe, which is hard to compare
 to the prior frontal view.  Small pleural effusions are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable decrease in free air since prior chest radiographs. 
 Improved aeration at the left lung base.  Similar appearance of right basilar
 opacities on frontal view, although difficult to compare to the prior study,
 which did not include a lateral view.
