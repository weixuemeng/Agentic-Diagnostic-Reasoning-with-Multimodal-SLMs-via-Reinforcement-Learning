                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tSAH // Eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube and left central venous catheter have been removed.  Lung volumes
 are lower than on the prior study.  Worsening bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique. There is new
 pulmonary vascular congestion and indistinctness of the pulmonary arteries.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Decreased lung volumes and worsening bibasilar atelectasis
 2. New mild pulmonary edema
