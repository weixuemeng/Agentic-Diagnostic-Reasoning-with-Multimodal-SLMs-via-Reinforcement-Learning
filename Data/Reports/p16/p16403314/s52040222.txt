                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The ascending aortic contour is convex,
 and there is also mild unfolding along the descending thoracic aorta.  The
 heart appears normal in size.  Minimal opacification at the lung bases is
 consistent with very minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  No evidence of acute disease.
