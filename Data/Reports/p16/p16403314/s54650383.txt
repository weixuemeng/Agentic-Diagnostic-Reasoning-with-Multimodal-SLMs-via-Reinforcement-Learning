                                 FINAL REPORT
   Chest x-ray from
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent tachypnea, altered mental status,
 high risk for aspiration, copious secretions  // r/o aspiration, PNA, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ fibular D 15:00 None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, with its tip overlying the proximal stomach. There is
 suggestion that the side port lies in the region of the GE junction, though
 not necessarily beyond that.    Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the
 distal SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen are low inspiratory volumes with patchy opacities at both lung
 bases, similar to prior.  No new focal opacity is identified.  There is
 pulmonary vascular plethora which could reflect CHF, but is likely accentuated
 by low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Note is made of thinned wire like leads coursing across the right chest into
 the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar patchy opacities again noted.  The differential includes
 atelectasis, early infectious infiltrates, and/or changes related to
 aspiration, but no definite interval change is identified compared to 1 day
 earlier.  .No new opacity identified.
 2. Pulmonary vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes,
 similar to prior.
 3. If the NG has a side-port, then it lies in the region of the GE junction. 
 Clinical correlation is requested. Advancement a small amount may help to
 ensure that the side port lies beyond the GE junction.
