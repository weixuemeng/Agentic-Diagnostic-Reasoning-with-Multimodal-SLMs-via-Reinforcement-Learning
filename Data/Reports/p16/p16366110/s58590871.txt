  Bilateral interstitial edema with alveolar component.Right upper lobe more
  focal consolidation may represent asymmetric alveolar pulmonary edema,
  infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, history of aortic stenosis status post aortic
 valve replacement in ___ question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Status post aortic valve replacement and median sternotomy.  Worsening
 bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities are compatible with worsening
 moderate pulmonary edema.  More focal opacity is seen in the right upper lung
 field, which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection cannot be
 excluded.  An additional patchy opacity is seen in the left lung base,
 possibly atelectasis. The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contour is similar.  No pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted.  Chronic left rib deformities are re- demonstrated.   Patient status
 post right arthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2. More focal opacity in the right upper lobe may represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded.
 3. Left lower lobe patchy opacity, possibly atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  More focal opacity in the right upper lobe may represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded. Follow-up
 chest x-ray after diuresis is suggested.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The follow up information was text paged to Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 5:36pm.
