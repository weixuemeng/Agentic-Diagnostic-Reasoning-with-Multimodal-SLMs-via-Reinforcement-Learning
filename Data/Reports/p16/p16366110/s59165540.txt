                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with severe aortic stenosis, CHF, A-fib, asbestosis,
 presenting with 2 weeks of cough, red sputum x2 days, and chest tightness and
 worsening dyspnea on exertion.  // please assess for pulmonary edema,
 infiltrate/consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT torso
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs.  There is
 slightly more confluent opacity on the frontal view of the right upper lung
 laterally.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles also suggests small
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Tortuosity
 of the descending thoracic aorta is noted.  Hiatal hernia on the current exam
 is suspected.  No acute osseous abnormalities, chronic left sided rib
 fractures are noted.  Right shoulder arthroplasty and chronic left shoulder
 degenerative changes are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings, thought to be due to interstitial edema. 
 More confluent opacity in the right lung laterally could be more conspicuous
 underlying parenchymal disease although superimposed infection would be
 difficult to exclude.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
