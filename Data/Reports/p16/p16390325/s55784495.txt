                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis status post intubation and orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube which terminates in the right mainstem bronchus which needs to be
 retracted approximately 5 cm to terminate 4 cm above the level of the carina. 
 There is left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse with volume loss on the left,
 and leftward shift of the mediastinal structures.  An orogastric tube courses
 through the esophagus and below the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach. A
 catheter tube overlies the left lung base.  The right lung is well-expanded
 with a linear area of atelectasis within the right lung base.    There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion is present on the right and a small to
 moderate pleural effusion is present on the left.  There is no evidence of
 overt pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus, resulting in
 left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse, and leftward shift of the mediastinum. 
 The ET tube should be retracted 5 cm for in order to terminate 4 cm above the
 carina.
 
 2. Small to moderate left pleural effusion.  
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
