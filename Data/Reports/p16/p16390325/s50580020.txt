                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Urosepsis with re-intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube tip
 lies approximately 2 cm above the carina.  It could be pulled back several
 centimeters.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and associated pleural effusion.  Less
 prominent atelectasis and possible small effusion is seen on the right.
 
 The nasogastric tube has been removed.
