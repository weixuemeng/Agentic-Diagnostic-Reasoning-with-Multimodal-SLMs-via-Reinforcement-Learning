                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:18 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with paralyzed left hemidiaphragm, new atrial
 fibrillation and crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right that developed
 between ___ is unchanged.  Low lung volumes exaggerate mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  I doubt there is pulmonary edema.  Pleural
 effusions are small if any.  Heart is difficult to assess given the low lung
 volumes, at least top normal size.
