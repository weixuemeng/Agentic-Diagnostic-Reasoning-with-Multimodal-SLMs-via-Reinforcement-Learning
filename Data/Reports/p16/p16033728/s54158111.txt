                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and acute hypoxia. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema or interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates apical lordotic
 positioning and low lung volumes.  Allowing for these limitations, again seen
 is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a stable-appearing left
 retrocardiac opacity.  The right lung appears clear.  No significant pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited radiograph secondary to patient positioning without
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
