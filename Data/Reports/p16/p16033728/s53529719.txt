                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with oxygen requirement and rising white blood
 count, assess for aspiration pneumonia.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Large left and moderate right pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have
 minimally increased.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous. There is
 no pneumothorax.  Moderate vascular congestion has increased.  Faint right
 perihilar opacity is new, could correspond to the clinical concern of
 aspiration.  Followup is recommended.
