                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, orthopnea for two months.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again there is significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
 increased as compared to the prior study.  There are streaky opacities in the
 right infrahilar region, similar to slightly increased as compared to the
 prior study.  The remainder of the lung fields are clear without focal opacity
 to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, increased since the prior
 study. Direct visualization under fluoroscopy could help evaluate for
 diaphragmatic paralysis.
 
 2.  Persistent streaky opacities in the right infrahilar region similar to
 slightly increased compared to the prior study may represent chronic
 atelectasis, underlying infection not entirely excluded.  There is no other
 focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
