                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain, shortness
 of breath with exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a right central venous catheter.  The lateral view is
 suboptimal due to overpenetration likely from patient's overlying soft tissue.
 No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Possible very minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion, although this may relate to technique.
