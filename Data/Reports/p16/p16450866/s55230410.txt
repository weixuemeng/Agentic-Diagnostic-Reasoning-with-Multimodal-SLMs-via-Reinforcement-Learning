                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___ as well as a chest CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits, and lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.  Skeletal structures are
 remarkable for bony prominence in the lower parasternal region on the lateral
 view, which appears to correspond to prominent anterior parasternal
 osteophytes on prior CT ___ ___, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.
 
 2.  Lower parasternal bony prominence, likely corresponding to large
 parasternal osteophytes on prior chest CT ___ ___.  Correlation with
 physical exam findings may be helpful to determine whether this corresponds to
 the site of palpable abnormality.
