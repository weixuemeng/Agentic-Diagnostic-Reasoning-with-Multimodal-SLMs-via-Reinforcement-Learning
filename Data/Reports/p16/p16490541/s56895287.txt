                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Empyema followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the chest tube at the left base.  No evidence of post-procedure
 pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis
 and effusion.  The right hemidiaphragm is less sharply seen, and there is
 blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with small pleural effusion and
 atelectatic changes in this region as well.
