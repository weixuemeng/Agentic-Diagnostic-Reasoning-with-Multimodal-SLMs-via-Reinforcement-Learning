                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and head strike, concerning for bleed or fracture. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal supine image of the chest.  There is a
 dense left lung opacity ocuppying a significant portion of the left
 hemithorax.  Some aerated lung seen at the apex  A nodular opacity seen
 overlying the right lower lung may represent a nipple shadow.  The right lung
 is well expanded and clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is partially obscured by the left lung base opacity, but appears
 similar to prior exam noting probable mild shift to the right.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dense left lung base opacity, suspicious for a pleural effusion with
 likely associated atelectasis and possible parenchymal disease.  Mild shift of
 the mediastinum to the right.  PA and lateral chest radiographs or chest CT
 could be pursued for further evaluation. 
 
 2.  Nodular opacity overlying the right lower lobe may represent a nipple
 shadow, and should be followed on subsequent studies.
