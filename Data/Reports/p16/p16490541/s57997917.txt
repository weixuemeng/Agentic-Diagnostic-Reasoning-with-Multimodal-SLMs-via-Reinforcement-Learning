 in similar position.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar to prior
 with adjacent atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature engorgement is similar to
 prior.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement with small bilateral pleural effusions,
