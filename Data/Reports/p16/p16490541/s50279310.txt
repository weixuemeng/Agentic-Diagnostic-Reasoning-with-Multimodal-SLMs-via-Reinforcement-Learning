                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Empyema. 
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ through ___, ___, CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  A catheter projects over the lower left
 hemithorax, unchanged in position.  Left pleural fluid and adjacent
 atelectasis are unchanged from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Persistent opacity in the left mid lung is likely asymmetric edema given the
 increased right basilar opacity with septal lines. Right upper lobe anterior
 segment opacity has further improved.  No right pleural effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left pleural effusion and atelectasis are unchanged from ___ 
 2. Likely asymemtric edema, left more than right, but pneumonia in the left
 mid lung cannot be excluded given the slow clearance.
