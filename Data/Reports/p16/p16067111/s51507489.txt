 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left anterior chest wall pain s/p injury
 2.5 weeks ago.  // ? occult left rib fracture      ? occult left rib fracture
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 No displaced rib fracture or pleural abnormality.  Lungs well expanded and
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
