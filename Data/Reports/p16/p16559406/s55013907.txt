                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased
 opacification of the bilateral bases, which likely represents atelectasis,
 however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.   The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification of the bilateral bases, which likely represents
 atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
