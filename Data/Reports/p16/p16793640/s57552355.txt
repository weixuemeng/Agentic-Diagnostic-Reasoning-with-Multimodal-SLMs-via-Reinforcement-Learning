                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal to mildly enlarged, although this is
 likely exaggerated also by AP technique and supine positioning.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous. No focal consolidation is seen.  There is mild left
 base atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 bones demonstrate S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
