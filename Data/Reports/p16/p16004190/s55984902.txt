                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with known effusions, Pleurexes not draining,
 dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC/right atrial junction.  Right
 basilar chest tube is demonstrated with a moderate size right pleural
 effusion, not substantially changed from ___.  Right basilar
 opacification likely reflects atelectasis, not substantially changed in the
 interval.  Innumerable nodules within the lungs are compatible with metastatic
 disease.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged with widening of
 the right paratracheal stripe compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  No
 left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No definite
 pulmonary edema seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate size right pleural effusion, not substantially changed in
 size compared to the prior exam, with a right basilar chest tube in place. 
 Continued right basilar atelectasis.  Innumerable pulmonary metastases, better
 assessed on prior CT along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
