 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided dialysis catheter is in place, again terminating in
 the upper right atrium.  The patient is also status post coronary artery
 bypass graft surgery.  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear not significantly changed. 
 There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity in
 the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring, probably located
 within the lingula.  There are new slightly displaced left posterolateral
 seventh and eighth rib fractures that appear acute.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rib fractures.
