 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in blunting of the posterior aspect of the costophrenic sinus, potentially
 suggesting a minimal pleural effusion.  In unchanged manner, there is both
 retrocardiac and right basal atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly without signs
 of fluid overload.  Unchanged alignment of sternal wires after CABG.  The
 hemodialysis catheter is in unchanged position.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or other acute lung disease.
