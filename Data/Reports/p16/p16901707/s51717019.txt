                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough for two to three weeks, hypoxemia
 and history of end-stage renal disease. Study requested to rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and prior chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: A dual-lumen dialysis catheter tip terminates at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is stable cardiomegaly.  There are confluent
 alveolar opacities along the superior left lower lobe and posterior left upper
 lobe, as well as additional patchy opacities in the left lower lobe posterior
 basilar segment. There is no frank pulmonary edema.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Superior segment left lower lobe and posterior segment left upper
 lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia. Given the dependent
 distribution, these findings may represent an aspiration pneumonia.  Recommend
 follow up CXR 4 weeks post treatment to document resolution if warranted
 clinically.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___, Dr. ___ nurse by Dr.
 ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 10:20 AM, time of discovery.
