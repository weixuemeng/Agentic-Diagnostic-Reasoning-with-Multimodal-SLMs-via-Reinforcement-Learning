                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left rib fractures, 7 through 9, evaluate for pneumothorax or
 hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are seen.  A left double-lumen catheter is seen ending in
 the right atrium.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  Bibasilar opacities represent atelectasis;
 however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Small left pleural effusion.  The
 upper lung zones are clear.  Left rib fractures are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia
 cannot be ruled out.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 
 3. No pneumothorax.
