                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status with recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Left sided dual-lumen central venous
 catheter seen with distal tip in the right atrium, similar to prior.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout
 the lungs similar to prior given differences in technique.  More confluent
 consolidation is seen in the left lung, minimally improved since prior.  There
 is now blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles suggestive of small
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable.  No acute
 osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interval improvement in the appearance of the left lung consolidation
 which persists.  As mentioned on prior, followup will be necessary after
 treatment.  Trace pleural effusions.  No other change.
