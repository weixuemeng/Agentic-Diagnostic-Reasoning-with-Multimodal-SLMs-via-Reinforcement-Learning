 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Dual-lumen presumed dialysis
 catheter terminates with proximal tip at the level of the cavoatrial junction
 and distal tip within the right atrium as before.  The lungs are well expanded
 with increased interstitial markings consistent with vascular congestions.  No
 focal consolidation is seen.  The heart is top normal in size with prominent
 left atrial contour.  Postsurgical changes from prior CABG are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
