                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and torso CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 right upper paratracheal stripe is widened, but the appearance is stable over
 time and in comparison to the CT torso.  The appearance is probably due to
 tortuosity of the great vessels and prominent mediastinal fat.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity is not specific but could be seen with minor atelectasis. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are
 noted along the thoracic spine.  No free air is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the left lower lung, nonspecific and probably
 due to atelectasis.  Other etiologies including pneumonia are not completely
 excluded, however.
