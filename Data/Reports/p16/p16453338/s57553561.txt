                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Given differences in positioning and technique, there
 has been no significant interval change.  Bilateral peripheral and lower lobe
 reticular opacities are again seen which are worse on the right than on the
 left.  This is compatible with patient's pulmonary fibrosis.  There is no
 definite new region of consolidation nor effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  High-density material seen within the colon.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
