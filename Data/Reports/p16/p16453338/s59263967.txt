                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Oxygen requirement, evaluation of pleural effusion versus chronic
 scarring.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderately reduced right-sided lung volumes, normal lung volumes on
 the left.  Subpleural predominance of an increase in right-sided interstitial
 markings, suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  In addition, several calcified
 granulomas are noted in the right upper lobe.  On the left, there is no
 evidence of subpleural lung disease.  Moderate cardiomegaly with increased
 size of the left ventricle.  Mild deviation of the mediastinum towards the
 right.
 
 Computed tomography could be used to further clarify the morphologic structure
 of the right-sided lung process.
 
 There currently is no evidence of acute lung disease such as pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
