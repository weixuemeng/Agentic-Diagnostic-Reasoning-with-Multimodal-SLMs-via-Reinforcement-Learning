                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multifocal pneumonia and colon cancer
 metastasis to the lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is technically limited by motion-related artifacts obscuring
 the lower lung fields.  There are extensive bilateral upper zone opacities
 with air bronchograms suggestive of pneumonia, previously diagnosed at an
 outside hospital.  Outside hospital imaging was not available for direct
 comparison.  Left hemidiaphragm is not visualized and suggests left lower
 field atelectasis and/or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically limited study demonstrating bilateral upper zone
 pneumonia.  Repeat imaging is recommended.
