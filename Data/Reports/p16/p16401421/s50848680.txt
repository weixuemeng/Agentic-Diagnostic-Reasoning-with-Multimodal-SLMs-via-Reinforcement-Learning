                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is increased prominence of the left hilum and increased opacity which is
 raises concern for increasing left hilar mass /lymphadenopathy.  Large rounded
 pleural-based opacity in the right upper to mid lung today measures 6.7 by
 approximately 5.5 cm compared to today's measurement of the prior CT is 4.9 x
 4.2 cm, givenyt differences in modality. Multiple ribs bilaterally show
 evidence of destruction as better evaluated on CT.  In addition, there are
 lytic lesions in scattered in the hemothorax including lucencies involving the
 ribs, clavicles, sternum, scapulae.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or intimal thorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  There is increased paratracheal soft tissue opacity which may be
 due to current worsening lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval progression of disease with increase in size of right pleural based
 mass and increase left hilar opacity and paratracheal opacity may be due to a
 worsening lymphadenopathy.
 
 Extensive osseous metastatic disease.
