 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Baseline examination, prior to start of new therapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rather extensive multifocal pleural soft tissue thickening, caused
 by areas of rib destruction, better visualized on the previous torso CT from
 ___.  As compared to the CT, the areas of destruction and pleural
 reaction have increased in extent and severity.  The left hilar mass has also
 slightly increased in size.  Currently, there is no indication for acute lung
 disease.  The cervical fixation devices, the post-surgical clips and the
 paramediastinal clips are in expected position.
