                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ years old woman with NG tube for hiatal hernia, please
 assess for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest x-rays for comparison at the time of
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  New NG tube has been placed with tip ending in the pyloric region. 
 Lung volume is moderate with small linear opacity at the left lung base
 compatible with atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus can be
 due to a small pleural effusion.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is
 top normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Correct positioning of NG tube.  No pneumothorax.  Small left
 basal atelectasis and pleural effusion.
