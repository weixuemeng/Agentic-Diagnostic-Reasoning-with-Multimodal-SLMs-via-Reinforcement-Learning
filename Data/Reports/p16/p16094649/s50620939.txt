 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 with the tip terminating in the mid thoracic trachea very low lung volumes

 No large consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.

 Endotracheal tube in standard placement.  Extremely low lung volumes.
