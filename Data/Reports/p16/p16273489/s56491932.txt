 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:49 PM
  Since the prior exam, there is worsening bibasilar opacification and
  obscuration of the hemidiaphragms, greater on the right than the left, which
  likely represents a combination of pleural fluid and parenchymal
  opacification.  This most likely is compressive atelectasis related to the
  effusions, though early infection or aspiration is a consideration, and close
  interval followup is recommended.  A retrocardiac opacity has also worsened,
  possibly representing infection.  Additionally, there is increased vascular
  congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
  normal.  -___ discussed with Dr. ___ at 950 pm on ___ at the time the
  findings were discovered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB. CXR portable to evaluate to lunch
 pathology given SOB and new onset O2 requirement.  // CXR to evaluate for new
 onset SOB and O2 requirement.     CXR to evaluate for new onset SOB and O2
 requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___ at 05:41.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pleural effusion, moderate on the right, smaller on the left, has increased
 since ___:41.  There has also been an increase in the moderately severe,
 generalized but asymmetric infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, worse in the
 right lung than the left.  Moderate widening of the mediastinum primarily in
 the right lower paratracheal station is most likely due to dilated central
 veins.
 
 All these findings could be due to volume related pulmonary edema, perhaps
 with a neurogenic component.  If this interpretation does not fit the clinical
 situation, pulmonary reaction to administered drugs or blood products should
 be considered, and finally widespread aspiration pneumonia.  If at all
 possible upright and lateral radiographs would be very helpful in determining
 the relative contributions of pleural effusion and pulmonary abnormality.  .
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
