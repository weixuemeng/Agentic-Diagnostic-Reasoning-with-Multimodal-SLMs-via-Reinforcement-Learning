                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with volvulized small bowel around J-tube.  Mildly
 hypoxic.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 5:38
 a.m.
 
 There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3 cm
 above the carina, appropriately sited.  There is a right IJ central line with
 distal lead tip in distal SVC.  There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side
 port are below the GE junction. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. 
 There are again seen bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac
 opacity.  There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  These findings appear stable.  There are no
 pneumothoraces.
