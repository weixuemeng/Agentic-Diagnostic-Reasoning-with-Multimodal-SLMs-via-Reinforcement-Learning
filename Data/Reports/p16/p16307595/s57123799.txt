                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and lower extremity swelling. 
 Evaluation for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is increased density in the entire
 right lung on the frontal projection.  Lateral views demonstrate confluent
 increased radiodensity along the major fissure, findings suggestive of
 loculated fluid within the right major fissure.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles suggests small effusions.  There is also mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is evident.  The aorta remains moderately
 calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged from prior.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and loculated fluid in the right major fissure.
