                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cancer, on chemotherapy with leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recent chest films are available.  On the lateral view, there is
 the vague suggestion of some increased opacification posteriorly, though this
 is not confirmed on the frontal view.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 this could represent a developing consolidation.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Left Port-A-Cath
 extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
