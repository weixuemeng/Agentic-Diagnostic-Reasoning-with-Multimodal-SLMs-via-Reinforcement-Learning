                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiac silhouette enlargement appears similar compared to
 the previous exam.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is worse in the interval.  Retrocardiac and right basilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is demonstrated with
 chronic pleural thickening noted at the lung bases.  Multilevel mild to
 moderate degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly worse in the interval with
 continued patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.
