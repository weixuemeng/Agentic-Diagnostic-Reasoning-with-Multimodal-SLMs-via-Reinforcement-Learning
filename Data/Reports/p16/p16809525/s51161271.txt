                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  The thoracic aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflects chronic
 pleural thickening.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  There
 are moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar atelectasis.
