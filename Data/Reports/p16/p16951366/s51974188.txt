                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with question CHF given bilateral lower extremity
 swelling.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been interval
 resolution of the previously seen left-sided effusion.  There are persistent
 changes suggestive of pleural thickening on the right; however, is less
 extensive when compared to the right, suggestive of prior component of
 effusion.  Underlying scarring is also possible, not significantly changed
 from prior.  There is no new consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged
 but stable.  Hypertrophic changes are seen in the spine, also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of previously seen left-sided pleural
 effusion and decrease in right-sided pleural effusion since prior with
 persistent right-sided pleural thickening.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
