                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate nasogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an enteric tube with the tip
 terminating in the stomach, but the side port in the distal esophagus.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs are fairly well-aerated,
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild
 atelectasis at the bilateral lung bases, left greater than right, is noted. 
 Note is made of a left chest wall port with catheter in similar position
 compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach, but with the side-port still in
 the distal esophagus.  If desired, the tube can be advanced approximately 5 cm
 to ensure that the side port is well positioned within the stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Tube advancement of approximately 5 cm to ensure the side
 port is well positioned within the stomach, if desired.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ at approximately ___ on ___, 5 minutes after
