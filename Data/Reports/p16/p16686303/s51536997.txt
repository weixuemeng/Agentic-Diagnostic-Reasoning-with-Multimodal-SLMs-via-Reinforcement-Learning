  Into tracheal tube terminates in appropriate position.  Right-sided PICC line
  is in unchanged position at the cavoatrial junction.  New large-bore right
  internal jugular line is present without pneumothorax.  Veil like bilateral
  opacities are compatible with a combination of pulmonary edema and effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.8 cm above the carina.
 The patient has a venous introduction sheath in the right internal jugular
 vein and a right PICC line.
 
 Lung volumes have slightly decreased.  There are bilateral pleural effusions
 and areas of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema as well as non-characteristic
 opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas, likely reflecting atelectasis.  In
 addition, the left upper lobe is relatively dense, so that the presence of a
 pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded.  Close radiographic followups are
 required.
