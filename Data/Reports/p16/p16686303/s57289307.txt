 HISTORY:  Status post exploration of left thigh hematoma.  Remains intubated
 postop.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval intubation
 with the endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm from the carina.  Again seen are
 bilateral basilar opacities obliterating the costophrenic angles which are
 likely pleural effusions, with no gross change from the prior radiograph. 
 Surgical ___ are again seen overlying the left hemithorax.  The support
 lines and tubes are unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval intubation with endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm from the carina.
 Otherwise no gross interval change with continued signs of pulmonary edema.
