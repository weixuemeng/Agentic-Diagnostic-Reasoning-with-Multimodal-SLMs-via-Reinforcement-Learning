                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post liver transplant, patient on immunosuppression
 with fever.
 
 There are no recent prior studies available for comparison.  More recent study
 is ___.
 
 Large right pleural effusion has decreased.  Adjacent opacity could be
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Left pleural
 effusion is small.  There is no pneumothorax.  Large left central catheter is
 in standard position.  Cardiomegaly is obscured by left pleural effusion. 
 Left lower lobe opacities are partially due to atelectasis, pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Surgical clips project in
 the right upper quadrant.
