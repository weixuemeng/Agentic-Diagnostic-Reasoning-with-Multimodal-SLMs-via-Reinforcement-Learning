                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:09
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post liver transplant with recent
 right thoracentesis, evaluate for effusion and infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:03.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 5 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube, left internal jugular central line, right internal
 jugular catheter, feeding tube, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in
 position.  Increasing opacification of the right hemithorax likely
 representing reaccumulation of pleural fluid.  It is difficult to evaluate the
 underlying lung given the degree of opacification.  Left lung appears to have
 prominent vasculature, raising concern for an element of perihilar edema or
 fluid overload.  No left effusion.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant.
