                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue, immunosuppressed, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is
 slight increase in right pleural effusion which remains small in overall size.
 There is left basilar atelectasis.  No clear signs of pneumonia, though given
 the presence of a right effusion, the possibility of a subjacent consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.
 Bony structures intact.  Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in right pleural effusion.  Please note, there is
 likely right basal atelectasis, though subtle consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
