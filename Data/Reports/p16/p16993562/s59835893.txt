                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, elevated lactate and liver disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a new posterior opacity obscuring the
 right hemidiaphragm, worrisome for pneumonia.  A small pleural effusion
 accompanying the opacity is possible but not explicitly demonstrated.  There
 is no definite evidence for pleural effusion on the left.  The osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New posterior opacity in the right lower lobe worrisome for
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although atelectasis could also
 be considered.
