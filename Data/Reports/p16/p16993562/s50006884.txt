                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post liver transplant with right
 pleural effusion and chest tube removal on ___, here to reevaluate right
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 11:36
 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest interval
 reaccumulation of large right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and
 no significant mediastinal shift from ___.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Retrocardiac opacification and obscuring of the left hemithorax is most likely
 due to atelectasis in this postoperative patient.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to appreciate given obscuration of the borders but
 overall appears stable.  A left-sided dual central venous catheter is
 unchanged in position.  A tracheostomy tube is in stable position with a
 Dobbhoff feeding tube extending into the abdomen.  A right-sided PICC line is
 seen with the tip terminating in the mid SVC at the level of the carina. 
 Multiple dilated loops of large and possibly small bowel are suggestive of
 postoperative ileus or possible early obstruction.  Skin ___ and surgical
 clips are again seen in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Reaccumulation of large right pleural effusion from ___.
 
 2.  Multiple dilated loops of large and possibly small bowel suggest
 postoperative ileus or possible early obstruction.
