                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female postoperative day #___ status post liver
 transplant, now with persistent right pleural effusion, here to reassess for
 right pneumothorax status post pigtail catheter removal on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a tracheostomy
 tube, left-sided supraclavicular dual-channel catheter and right-sided PICC
 line unchanged in position.  A feeding tube is again seen coursing below the
 diaphragm and likely terminating past the pylorus.  Low inspiratory lung
 volumes are unchanged.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated, although the
 film is suboptimal.  Stable small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and small
 right pleural effusion best appreciated on the lateral radiograph are
 unchanged with associated bibasilar atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation
 is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Drainage tube and multiple surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax appreciated on today's exam.
 2.  Stable small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
