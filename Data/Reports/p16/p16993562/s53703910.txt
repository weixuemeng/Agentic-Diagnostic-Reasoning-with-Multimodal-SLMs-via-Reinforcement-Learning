                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with air leak after right pigtail placement, please
 evaluate for residual pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with
 persistent though slightly improved right pleural effusion layering
 posteriorly and tracking along right minor fissure.  Evaluation of right lung
 apex is obscured due to overlying medical devices, though there appears to be
 a small pneumothorax.  Increased opacification in the left lower lung may be
 due to worsening atelectasis, possibly small left pleural effusion. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.    Left-sided dual-lumen
 catheter with one distal tip terminating in the right atrium.  Dobbhoff tube
 is coiled within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with minmal
 decrease in right pleural effusion, now moderate in size and lying
 posteriorly.  Probable small right pneumothorax.
 
 ___ communicated these findings to Dr ___ at 17:20 on ___ via telephone.
