                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea on exertion, status post
 liver transplant, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.
 
 On the present PA and lateral chest views, the diaphragms are relatively high
 positioned, somewhat obscuring the cardiac silhouette.  Thus precise
 assessment of heart size cannot be performed.  Significant cardiac enlargement
 or left-sided heart failure, however, is unlikely as the existing pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened but without local
 contour abnormalities.  There is mild blunting of the right-sided lateral
 pleural sinus, corresponding blunting of the posterior pleural sinuses noted
 on the lateral view.  Left-sided pleural space, however, is free.  There is no
 evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates.  No pneumothorax is seen in the
 apical area.  Pleural thickening is noted in the apical area but smoothly
 delineated, not changed from previous examinations.  When comparison is made
 with the next preceding portable chest examination, the patient at that time
 was status post liver transplant and had bilateral pleural densities.  A
 wide-bore double-lumen catheter had been placed via the left internal jugular
 approach with the catheter tip resting in the right atrium.  This line has
 been removed.
 
 Impression: Right-sided lateral and posterior pleural densities representing
 post-operative pleural scars in this patient status post liver transplant. 
 Presently, no new acute infiltrates and no evidence of pulmonary congestion. 
 No pneumothorax and the previously present wide-bore dialysis catheter has
 been removed.
