                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA and lateral chest film, ___ at 11:04.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pigtail now clamped for 4 hours.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___, at 11:49.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:04 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  The
 left dual-lumen catheter is unchanged in position, ending in the right atrium.
 A right pigtail catheter in the lower hemithorax is again seen and there is
 likely a small residual pleural effusion.  Patchy airspace disease at the
 right base likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Clips in the right upper quadrant
 are consistent with cholecystectomy.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between
 studies.
