                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with end-stage liver disease, presents with
 seizure.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate somewhat
 suboptimal frontal evaluation due to obscuration of lung bases by the upper
 abdomen.  Allowing for such, the lungs are clear, although low in volume. 
 There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or large effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.   
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process such as pneumonia.
