 Removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with remaining two
 internal jugular introducer catheters in place, one of which appears to be
 slightly kinked.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 2.5 cm above the carina but
 unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is seen below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  Bilateral upper abdominal drains remain in place and
 unchanged in position.  A layering right effusion with some associated volume
 loss consistent with atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited given the supine
 technique.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
