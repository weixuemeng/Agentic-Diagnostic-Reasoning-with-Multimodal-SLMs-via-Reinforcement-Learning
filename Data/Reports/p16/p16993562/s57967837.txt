                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess pigtail catheter and pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax has decreased.  Right basal pigtail catheter remains
 in unchanged position.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Right PICC
 tip is in the mid SVC.  Left supraclavicular double-lumen catheter is in
 standard position.  There are low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectases have
 increased.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, larger on the
 left side.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
 
 Multiple surgical clips and a drain in the right upper quadrant are noted.
 
 The left pleural effusion is small to moderate.
