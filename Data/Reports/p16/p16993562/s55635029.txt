 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female postop day #___ status post liver transplant
 now with persistent right pleural effusion status post pigtail catheter
 removal on ___, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show tracheostomy
 tube, left-sided dual lumen catheter and right-sided PICC line unchanged in
 position.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view
 on these images.  The inspiratory lung volumes are persistently low with
 associated bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged from the preceding radiograph. The
 tiny right apical pneumothorax from ___ is decreased or unchanged in size.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are best appreciated on the lateral
 radiograph and unchanged or slightly increased in size from ___.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with an
 unfolded thoracic aorta. No evidence of free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased or stable size of tiny right apical pneumothorax from ___.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  No evidence of free air.  If clinical concern persists, a CT could be
 considered for confirmation.
