                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PA and lateral view of the chest were obtained.
 
 In comparison to the prior exam, lung volumes are lower.  Linear opacities at
 the right base are accentuated due to low lung volumes, but grossly unchanged
 from the prior exam and likely represents scarring and atelectasis.  Left mid
 lung linear atelectasis/scarring is also again seen. There is no discrete
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Right basilar and lingular scarring/atelectasis.
