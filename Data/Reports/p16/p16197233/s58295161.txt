                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of diabetes with two weeks of upper respiratory symptoms,
 now with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including borderline
 cardiomegaly.  Lung volumes are low with persistent mild relative elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax although posterior costophrenic sulci are somewhat difficult to
 assess on the lateral view.  Allowing for technique, aside from mild
 atelectasis at the lung bases, the lungs appear clear.  There is no evidence
 of free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No free air identified.
