                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with GIB intubated  // ETT placemen
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today ___ at 08:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is somewhat low in position, terminating approximately 9
 in 10 mm above level the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 to
 2.5 cm for more optimal positioning.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm
 into the expected location of the stomach.  Low lung volumes persist. 
 Interval prominence of the perihilar vasculature may be due to pulmonary
 vascular engorgement in combination with low lung volumes.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube somewhat low in position, terminating approximately 1 cm
 above the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 due to and a 0.5 cm
 for more optimal positioning.  Discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:30PM on ___ via telephone.
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there appears to be interval increase in perihilar vascular prominence which
 may be due to evolving pulmonary vascular engorgement.
