                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral pleural effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase
 in extent of the known hilar adenopathy, notably on the left.  The signs
 indicative of interstitial fluid overload, including the bilateral pleural
 effusions, better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph,
 are stable.  A pre-existing right upper lobe parenchymal opacity that is
 rounded in appearance and was documented on the CTA examination from ___, has increased in size and density.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The extent of the
 pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis has decreased.  No other interval
 changes.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
