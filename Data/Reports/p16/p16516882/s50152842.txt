                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with afib, HFrEF, recent pneumonia here with
 abdominal pain  // rule out infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial
 edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Areas of plate like
 atelectasis are noted in the bilateral lung bases. Bibasilar opacities most
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis in the setting of bilateral pleural
 effusions although superimposed infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is
 present. The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged. The mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits. Multilevel hypertrophic changes of the spine are
 noted. There is dense vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities most likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
 3. Cardiomegaly. No prior studies available for comparison.
