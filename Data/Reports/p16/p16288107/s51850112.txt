                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung
 volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Within this limitation, there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process with low lung volumes.
