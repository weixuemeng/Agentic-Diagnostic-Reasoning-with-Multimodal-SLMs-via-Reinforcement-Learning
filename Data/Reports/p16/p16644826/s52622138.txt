 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to small effusion or
 pleural thickening.  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation.  Cardiomegaly
 is stable.  Right mediastinal contour is unchanged and compatible with
 adenopathy.  Right axillary surgical clips again noted.  No displaced rib
 fractures identified.
