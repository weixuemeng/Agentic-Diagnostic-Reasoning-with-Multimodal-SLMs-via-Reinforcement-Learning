                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AFib, left pleural effusion, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:54 p.m.
 
 Compared with prior film, opacity at the right base is slightly more
 pronounced.  This appears to represent a combination of a small effusion and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  More focal opacity at the upper
 edge of the effusion laterally could represent some pleural fluid or
 parenchymal opacity.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
