                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of breast cancer and stage IV lung cancer, status post right
 lower lobectomy presenting with hypoxia and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___ through
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly appears similar to prior examination though
 complete comparison is difficult given the presence of a moderate-to-large
 right subpulmonic pleural effusion as well as increased density in the right
 lung base, which may represent pneumonia.  Prominent right hilar contour
 suggests lymphadenopathy. There is central vascular congestion along with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion.  Surgical clips
 project over the right axilla.  The patient is status post right mastectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema as well as 
 moderate-to-large right-sided subpulmonic effusion and increased density at
 the right lung base which may represent concurrent pneumonia.  Probable right
 hilar lymphadenopathy.
