                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute short of breath, question edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is hyperinflation, suggesting background COPD.  There is moderately
 severe cardiomegaly, with prominence of the right mediastinal soft tissues. 
 There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 and a small right effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution, without other
 evidence of CHF.  The patient is apparently status post right mastectomy, with
 right axillary clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD and stable cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  New small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  Mild diffuse
 prominence of the interstitial markings is noted, while this could relate to
 mild interstitial edema, it is less pronounced than on the earlier film and
 may represent background parenchymal scarring.
 
 4.  Subsegmental atelectasis at the left base and small right effusion similar
 to prior.
 
 5.  Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues apparently reflects
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  This is also reflected in loss of the right
 supraclavicular companion shadow.  This is better depicted on a chest CT from
 ___.  The pulmonary nodules seen on the CT are not readily apparent
 radiographically, though may be related to opacity seen at the right base
 laterally.
 
 6.  Status post right mastectomy with right axillary clips.
