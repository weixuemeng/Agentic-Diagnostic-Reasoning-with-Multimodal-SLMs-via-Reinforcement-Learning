                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post lymph node biopsy with expanding neck hematoma.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in
 appearance of the mediastinum.  Linear subpleural opacities at the level of
 the right lung bases and mid right lung could be indicative of interstitial
 fluid overload.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases and a small right
 pleural effusion are still present.  Moderate cardiomegaly without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
