                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (PA and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure who
 presents with weight gain; evaluate for pulmonary edema or interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiovascular congestion and pulmonary edema are perhaps slightly
 improved compared to the prior exam when accounting for differences in
 technique. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. In particular, the left
 atrium, left main pulmonary artery, and right atrium remain prominent and are
 probably not appreciably changed. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. The replaced mitral valve as well as median sternotomy wires and
 surgical clips projecting over the mid trachea appear intact and unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiovascular congestion/pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly,
 perhaps slightly improved since the prior exam.
