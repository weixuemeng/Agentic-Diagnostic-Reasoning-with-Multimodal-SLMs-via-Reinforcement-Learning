 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, recent endocarditis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip terminates within the proximal right atrium. The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged with left atrial and left ventricular calcifications again
 noted. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with cephalization is similar
 compared to the prior study. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not
 substantially changed in the interval. Patchy opacity within the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 mild left basilar atelectasis.
