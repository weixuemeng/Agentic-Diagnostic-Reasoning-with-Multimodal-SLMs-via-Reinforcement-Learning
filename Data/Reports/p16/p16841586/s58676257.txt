                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post CABG with pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate increase in left
 basilar opacity, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Previously
 seen left upper lobe atelectasis has improved.  There is fluid seen in the
 minor fissure along with associated atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax
 seen.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged but is partially obscured by the left
 pleural effusion.  Widened mediastinum is unchanged from previous imaging. 
 Pacer is seen in the left anterior axillary position with intact leads
 following the expected course to the right atrium and right ventricle.  There
 has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter and a right IJ sheath is
 in place.  The patient has been extubated since prior imaging.  Again seen are
 a left-sided chest tube and a mediastinal drain.  There has been interval
 increase in bowel gas.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Improving left
 upper lobe atelectasis.  Fluid in the minor fissure.
