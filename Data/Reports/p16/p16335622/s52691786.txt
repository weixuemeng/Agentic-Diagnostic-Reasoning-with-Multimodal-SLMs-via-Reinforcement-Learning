  Bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacity may
  be due to atelectasis although infection is possible. Dense opacity seen on
  the lateral view not confirmed on the frontal view and is likely extra
  thoracic although nonurgent repeat exam to confirm extrathoracic location is
  suggested. Probable hiatal hernia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest pain  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right dual lumen central venous catheters seen with distal tip likely in the
 right atrium. There are small to moderate bilateral effusions. Retrocardiac
 opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm may be due to effusion although
 superimposed consolidation is also possible. Indistinct pulmonary vascular
 markings seen more superiorly in the lungs. There is at least moderate cardiac
 enlargement although not well assessed. Hiatal hernia is suspected. On the
 lateral view there is dense opacity projecting over the cardiac silhouette of
 extreme high density not seen on the frontal and is likely extra thoracic in
 location. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacity may
 be due to atelectasis although infection is possible. Dense opacity seen on
 the lateral view not confirmed on the frontal view and is likely extra
 thoracic although nonurgent repeat exam to confirm extrathoracic location is
 suggested. Probable hiatal hernia.
