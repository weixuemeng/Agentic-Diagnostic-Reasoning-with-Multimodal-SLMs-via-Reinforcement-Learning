                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p IJ tunneled line removal  // ?PTX after
 line removal
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ just after midnight, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is a left IJ catheter with
 tip at the expected confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly,
 pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions, and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation. Right midzone lateral calcified granuloma again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right IJ line. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
