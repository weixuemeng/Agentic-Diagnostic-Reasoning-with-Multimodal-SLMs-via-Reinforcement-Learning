                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with leucocytosis  // r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are moderate to moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, which have
 increased compared with ___. There is likely underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation. The right midzone/base infiltrate seen on the prior film
 is partially obscured by the right pleural effusion on today's exam. Again
 seen is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, consistent with
 CHF. Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the effusions, but appear
 overall similar. A calcified granulomas seen in the right mid zone laterally.
 
 Again seen is the right-sided catheter. Previously identified pigtail
 catheters are not clearly visible on the current exam --? interval removal.
 Background osteopenia and degenerative changes again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in both right and left pleural effusions, now moderate to
 moderately large in size, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is unchanged.
