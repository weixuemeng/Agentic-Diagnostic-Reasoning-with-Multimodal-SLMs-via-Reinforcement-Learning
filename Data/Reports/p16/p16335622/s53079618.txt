 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset hypoxioas, deswat s/p B/L chest
 tube placement  // r/o acute process, increase size pleural effusion      r/o
 acute process, increase size pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 6:52 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe collapse has resolved, and mediastinum has partially returned
 to the midline position.  New opacification in the left lower lobe is probably
 developing atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion persists despite the
 basal pleural catheter.  There is no left pneumothorax.  No pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion on the right, basal pleural drain in place has
 repositioned.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion, particularly in the
 right lung, has improved.  Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
