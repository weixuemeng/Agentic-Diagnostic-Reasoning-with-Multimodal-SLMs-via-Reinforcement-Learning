                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: ___ year old woman with left chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal, with heart in the upper limits of normal.  The right lung is well
 expanded and clear.  In the left lung base, there is a peripheral opacity in
 the left lower lobe, could represent atelectasis; however, in the setting of
 acute pleuritic chest pain, this would be concerning for pulmonary embolism
 with infarction.  Trace left pleural effusion is present. There is no
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left effusion with a peripheral left lower lobe opacity,
 may represent atelectasis or pulmonary infarction, especially given the
 history of left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  CTA is recommended for further
 evaluation.
