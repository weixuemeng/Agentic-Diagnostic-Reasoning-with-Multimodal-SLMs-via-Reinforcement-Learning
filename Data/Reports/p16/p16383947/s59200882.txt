                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of acute pericarditis, cardiac tamponade s/p
 pericardial drain presenting with a 1 week history of intermittent
 lightheadedness and chest pain over, evaluate for cardiomegaly, or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple previous chest x-rays, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads are seen projecting
 over the right atrium and right ventricle in grossly appropriate and unchanged
 location.  In comparison to radiograph from ___, there has been interval
 reduction in the size of the cardiac silhouette, now within normal limits. 
 There is no evidence of mediastinal contour abnormality.  The bilateral hila
 are grossly unremarkable.  Subtle opacification overlying the lower third of
 the left lung on AP projection may relate to overlying soft tissue.  A 7 mm
 rounded density adjacent to the right hilum may represent a calcified
 granuloma or more likely a vessel seen en face. Otherwise, the lungs are
 grossly clear, without CHF, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region.  Is
 noted.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process detected.  No evidence of cardiomegaly or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
