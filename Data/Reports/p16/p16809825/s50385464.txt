 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male admitted with cellulitis and spiking temperatures
 despite antibiotics.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rounded homogeneous density measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in the left
 upper lobe is a calcified granuloma.  On the lateral, there is a 1.5 cm x 1.5
 cm rounded opacity projecting superior to the right hilus which may represent
 a nodule or lymph node.  No additional focal opacity, pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema.  Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila
 otherwise normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Calcified granuloma with adjacent rounded opacity that may
 represent lymph node from a prior infection such as tuberculosis or
 histoplasmosis or a lung nodule. Compare with prior chest radiographs to
 ensure a stable appearance over ___ years and if none available, evaluation
 with chest CT should be considered.
