                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes resulting
 in a prominent cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Mildly
 increased right infrahilar opacity has a possible correlate on lateral view,
 and may represent atelectasis, but an early developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mildly increased right infrahilar opacity has a possible correlate on
 lateral view.  Although this may represent atelectasis, an early developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Low lung volumes resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.
