                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Heterogeneous
 opacities in the right lung have slightly improved, particularly at the right
 lung base, and probably represent multifocal infection.  Left lung is grossly
 clear except for minor atelectasis in the retrocardiac area.
