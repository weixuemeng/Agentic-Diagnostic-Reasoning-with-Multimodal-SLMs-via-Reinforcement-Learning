                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, cough, fever, hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased opacification at
 the left lung base, which is concerning for pneumonia, and is similar to the
 most recent prior chest radiograph. There is slight increased opacification at
 the right base but improved from prior, which likely represents atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No acute bony abnormality
 is present.  The patient is status post spinal fusion, with fracture of the
 right-sided fusion rod, unchanged from prior exams.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification at the left lung base is concerning for pneumonia,
 with similar appearance to the most recent prior study.
