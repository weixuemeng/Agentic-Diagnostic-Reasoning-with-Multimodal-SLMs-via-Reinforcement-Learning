                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___, and CTA of the chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes which
 result in bronchovascular crowding.  As before there is an area of increased
 opacification of the left lung base. This is slightly less conspicuous than on
 the recent prior chest radiograph, and may represent atelectasis, although
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 An area of increased opacification of the right lung base slightly increased
 from the prior exam, and likely represents atelectasis or aspiration.  There
 is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The patient is status post spinal
 fusion, with fracture of the right-sided fusion rod, unchanged from prior
 exams.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Area of opacification of the left lung base has slightly improved.  Increased
 opacification of the right lung base from the prior exam, and may represent
 aspiration or infection.
