                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change following left thoracoscopy and
 lysis of adhesions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___.  Series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP radiograph of the chest depicts new diffuse
 opacification of left lung, likely secondary to mild edema produced by the
 operation.  The left mid lung field is slightly denser, which may represent
 persistence of the loculated pleural effusions seen on the prior radiograph
 from ___.  Two left basilar and one left apical pleural drainage
 catheters are present.  There is a small left pleural effusion and left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Very mild right lower lobe linear atelectasis or scarring
 is unchanged.  The right lung is otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax
 and the heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable postoperative edema of the left lung with equivocal persistence
 of the loculated pleural effusion underlying it.
 2.  Small layering pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
