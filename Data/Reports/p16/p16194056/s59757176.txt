                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left lung abscesses status post washout. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___ as well as washout chest radiograph on
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lat chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The right lung is unremarkable.  The
 left lung demonstrates a peripheral opacity in the mid lung field which is
 improved compared with prior exam.  Two chest tubes are noted in unchanged
 position ending in expected position in the opacified area as demonstrated in
 the lateral radiograph.  No new air-fluid level denoting reaccumulation is
 present. Again noted is a small left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A
 PICC line ends in the lower SVC, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of left lung opacity consistent with known
 empyema.  No evidence of fluid reaccumulation.  Supporting devices are in
 expected position.
