                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size most likely.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is a
 consolidation of the left lower lung with mild volume loss and possibly an
 associated pleural effusion.  The appearance is most suggestive of lobar
 pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear and unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature is noted along the lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting lobar pneumonia involving the left lower lobe
 with a possible pleural effusion.
