                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previous chest radiograph demonstrated a moderate-sized
 multiloculated pleural effusion.  On the current exam, a retrosternal
 component of the fluid has resolved, and a basilar dependent component of the
 pleural effusion has significantly improved, with associated improved aeration
 of the left lower lobe.  However, a large elliptical opacity persists,
 measuring ___.5 cm in craniocaudad dimension, best visualized on the lateral
 radiograph overlying the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  It has obtuse angles
 with the adjacent lung parenchyma, consistent with a pleural location. 
 Additionally, a discrete air-fluid level is present superiorly and has
 differing measurements on the PA and lateral views, also placing this within
 the pleural compartment.  Additionally, adjacent to this pleural opacity is an
 area of apparent consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe,
 just below the major fissure.  Opacities in the remaining of portion of the
 left lower lobe are predominantly linear, suggesting atelectasis.  Mild volume
 loss is present in the left hemithorax.  The right lung is slightly
 overexpanded, but grossly clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Although the basilar, dependent component of the left pleural effusion has
 improved, a large loculated pleural fluid collection is present posteriorly in
 the left hemithorax and now has an air-fluid level, consistent with a
 hydropneumothorax. Adjacent focal consolidation in superior segment left lower
 lobe.
 
 Considering the patient's infectious symptoms and lack of interventional
 procedure to explain the air-fluid level, a chest CT is suggested for further
 characterization, as discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:26 a.m. on
 ___, at the time of radiographic discovery.
