 FINDINGS:  The patient is after decortication.  The guidewire of the right
 PICC line has been removed.  Instead of the previously placed pigtail

 pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  The post-surgical opacities at the
 left lateral lung base are within the expected drainage.
 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  Normal appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.
