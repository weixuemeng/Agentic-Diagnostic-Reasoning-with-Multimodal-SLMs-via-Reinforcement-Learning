                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia in a diffuse pulmonary process. 
 Evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  422 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes have improved and there may also be an improvement in the
 diffuse interstitial infiltration in both lungs which appeared between
 ___ and ___.  Heart size is top normal common exaggerated by low
 lung volumes.  Distended mediastinal veins and suggests elevated central
 venous pressure or volume.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  ET
 tube in standard position, tip no less than 3.5 cm above the carina.  Right
 PICC line ends in the right atrium at the level no less than 6 cm below the
 carina, and there would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to place it low in the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight  improvement in  severe interstitial interstitial pulmonary abnormality
 over 20 hours.  Right PICC line ends in right atrium.  ET tube in standard
 placements.
