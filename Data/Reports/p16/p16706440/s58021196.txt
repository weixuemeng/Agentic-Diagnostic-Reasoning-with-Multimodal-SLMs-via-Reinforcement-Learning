  Bilateral nodules redemonstrated. Increased right basal likely atelectasis.
  Vague left peripheral midlung opacity is likely overlying soft tissue given
  different position of the breast on this study, however if high concern for
  pneumonia, consider 2 view of the chest to assess.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Flu, cough, left-sided crackles, history of pulmonary metastatic
 disease.  Assessment of the lung parenchyma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are pre-existing metastatic changes at both lung bases, but
 more extensive at the left, visualized in almost unchanged manner.  Also
 unchanged is the size of the cardiac silhouette and the appearance of the left
 pectoral Port-A-Cath.
 
 New, however, is the subtle peribronchial pattern of opacity at the right lung
 bases.  The opacity shows subtle air bronchograms.  These findings could be
 suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 No evidence of pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
