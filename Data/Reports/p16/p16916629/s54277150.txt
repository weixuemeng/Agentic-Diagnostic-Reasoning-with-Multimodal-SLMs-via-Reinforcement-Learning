                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, dyspnea and
 orthopnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Imaging of the lungs is subject to technical limitations in a patient of this
 size.  Pulmonary edema is mild, if any.  There is no consolidation or collapse
 or appreciable pleural effusion.  Mediastinal widening is more pronounced,
 probably due to superimposition of vascular engorgement, but possibly fat
 deposition in the setting of mediastinal adenopathy predominantly in the
 prevascular station.
