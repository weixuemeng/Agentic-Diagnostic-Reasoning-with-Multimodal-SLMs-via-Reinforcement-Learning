  Endotracheal tube is at 3.7 cm from the carina and can be retracted 1.3 cm for
  optimal positioning. Right lung edema appears mildly increased. Otherwise
  little change in comparison to prior study from the same day with complete
  left lower lobe collapse.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now an
 endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.
 Worsening vascular congestion on the right, but otherwise little change. 
 Again, there is evidence of collapse of the left lower lobe.
