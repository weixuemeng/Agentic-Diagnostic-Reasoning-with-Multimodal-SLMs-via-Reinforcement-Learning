                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic melanoma and a recurrent
 left effusion status post pleurodesis and Pleurx placement, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:49.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 7:50 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Two left chest tubes and a single-lead left-sided pacer remain in place. 
 There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with known
 metastases.  In addition, there is more focal patchy opacity at the left base
 in the setting of an effusion, which may reflect compressive atelectasis,
 although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should be considered as this
 appears to be worsening.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 No pneumothorax appreciated.
