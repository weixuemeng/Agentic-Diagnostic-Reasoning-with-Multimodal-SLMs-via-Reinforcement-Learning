                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and recurrent malignant
 pleural effusions, status post chest tube placement.  Evaluate for status of
 pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, not significantly
 changed from the prior study.  Again seen are multiple bilateral pulmonary
 nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Two chest tubes project over the left hemithorax. 
 Left-sided oral pacemaker is present with the leads in the appropriate
 position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are not
 significantly changed from the prior study.
