                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with a pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small left pleural effusion has decreased since ___, basal pleural tube
 still in place.  Very large cardiac silhouette may have decreased slightly in
 size.  There is also the suggestion that some of the lung nodules in the right
 lung may be slightly smaller, but this determination is better made,
 particularly if there is substantial clinical significance, by CT scanning
 measurements.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead unchanged in position.
 No appreciable pneumothorax.
