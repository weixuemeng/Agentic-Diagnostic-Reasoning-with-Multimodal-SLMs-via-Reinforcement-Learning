                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post VATS left lower lobe wedge
 resection on ___.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  The configuration suggests
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly as well
 as a moderate enlargement of the left atrium with some right-sided
 intracardiac double contour straightening of the left heart border.  A
 permanent pacer is in left anterior axillary position, seen to be connected to
 a single intracavitary electrode terminating in a position compatible with the
 right ventricle.  The pulmonary vasculature shows a mild upper zone
 redistribution pattern; however, no interstitial or alveolar edema is
 identified.  On the other hand, the marked irregular distribution of the
 pulmonary vessels in the periphery, coinciding with local areas of increased
 translucency and low position, flattened diaphragms is suggestive of COPD. 
 Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax in the apical areas.  In comparison with the next preceding chest
 examination of ___, the at that time postoperative existing
 left-sided chest wall emphysema has absorbed.  Also, the left basal
 postoperative linear small atectatic densities have normalized.
 
 Also, noteworthy in comparison with the previous study is that the, at that
 time existing more marked cardiac enlargement and the bilateral small amount
 of pleural effusions have disappeared.
