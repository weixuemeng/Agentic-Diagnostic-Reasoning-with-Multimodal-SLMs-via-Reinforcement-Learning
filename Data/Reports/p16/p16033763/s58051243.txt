                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post left lower lobe wedge resection.  Chest tube
 removal, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Left pacemaker lead tip is in the right
 ventricle.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 smaller, larger on the right side and unchanged.  Left chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema has increased.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are
 likely atelectasis.
