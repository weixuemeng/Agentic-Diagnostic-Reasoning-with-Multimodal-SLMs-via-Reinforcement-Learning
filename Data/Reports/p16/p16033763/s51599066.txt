                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs were acquired.  There is a left-sided
 pacemaker with an associated right ventricular lead, appropriately positioned.
 The lungs are hyperexpanded and there is flattening of the hemidiaphragms with
 enlargement of the retrosternal airspace, consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is a right lower lung granuloma, as before.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute process.
 2.  Findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
