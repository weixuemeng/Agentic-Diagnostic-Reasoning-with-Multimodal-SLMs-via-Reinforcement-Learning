                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic melanoma status post chest
 tube placement, triggered for hypotension, evaluate for interval change and
 question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 757.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Two left chest tubes and a single-lead left-sided pacer remain in place. 
 There are multiple parenchymal pulmonary nodules consistent with known
 metastatic disease.  Small bilateral effusions, left greater than right again
 are seen.  In addition, there is a more focal patchy opacity at the left base
 which could reflect compressive atelectasis but also raises the possibility of
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.
