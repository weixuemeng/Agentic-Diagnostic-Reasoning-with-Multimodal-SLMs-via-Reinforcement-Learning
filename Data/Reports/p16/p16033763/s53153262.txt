                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and recurrent pleural
 effusions.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small
 left-sided pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed.  A small
 right-sided pleural effusion is also seen, and is slightly increased in size
 over the interval.  Again seen are multiple bilateral nodules in the lungs
 consistent with metastatic disease.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Two chest tubes project over the left hemithorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis, and slight interval increase in size in the small right pleural
 effusion.
