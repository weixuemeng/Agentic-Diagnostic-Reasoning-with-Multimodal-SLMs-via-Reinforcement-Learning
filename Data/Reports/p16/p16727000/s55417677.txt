 lower lungs on an abdomen CT in ___ showing retained secretions. The lungs
 elsewhere are clear. There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement. Heart size is normal.
 
 Bronchiectasis is a ready explanation for hemoptysis, but it is possible that
 a more subtle cause might be overlooked, and therefore a CT scan is
 recommended.

 CT scan were posted by Dr. ___ on ___ at 16:30 to the Department
