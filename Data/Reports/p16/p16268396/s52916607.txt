                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // Pulmonary changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no
 pulmonary edema.  Mild deviation of the trachea towards the right, likely
 caused by that tortuous ascending aorta. Currently there is no evidence of
 pathologic mediastinal contours or of lung nodules and masses.
