                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of COPD, now with productive cough,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Prominence of lung markings in the right lower lung suggests a
 focal consolidation.  No effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Gynecomastia is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  
 
 Although the right lower lung density was initially attributed to soft tissue
 projection rather than pneumonia, the patient was discharged from the ED with
 antibiotics.
