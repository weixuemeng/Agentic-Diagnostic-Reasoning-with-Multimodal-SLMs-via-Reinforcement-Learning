                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt
 pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
