                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
 
  Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 increased density within the lung bases, left greater than right.  Findings
 may reflect atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical circumstance.  No overt interstitial edema is evident.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 There are right-greater-than-left rounded paratracheal opacities, new or more
 pronounced compared with ___. While this could reflect vascular ectasia,
 the patient aslo has a history of thyroid nodules and paratracheal masses,
 which may be contributing.   Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 within normal limits for age.  Probable cardiomegaly, with appearance also
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  However,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical circumstance.
 2. Right > left paratracheal opacities, new compared with ___. Please see
 comment above.
