                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are slightly reduced. 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  Linear opacity within the right lung base is
 compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joints are present.  Mild degenerative changes are also seen
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base.  No radiographic
 evidence for pneumonia.
