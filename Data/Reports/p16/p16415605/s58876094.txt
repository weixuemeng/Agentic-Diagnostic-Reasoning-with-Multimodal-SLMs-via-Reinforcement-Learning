                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Supraventricular tachycardia, shortness of breath.  Please
 evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Minimal bibasilar opacifications are
 evident likely reflecting atelectasis.  A 1.5-cm density projects over the
 right mid lung, stable compared to ___ study.  Of note, on both
 studies, lesion projects over the anterior right fourth rib and may reflect
 osseous abnormality, though cannot exclude parenchymal nodule.  No
 opacification concerning for pneumonia identified.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax present.  Multilevel degenerative changes identified within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications, likely reflecting atelectasis.  1.5-cm
 density projecting over the right mid lung and anterior right fourth rib. 
 Given stable relationship to anterior fourth rib, this likely represents an
 ossific density, possibly degenerative change at the costochondral junction,
 however, cannot definitively exclude pulmonary mass.  Recommend reevaluation
 with shallow oblique radiographs to better localize the opacity.
