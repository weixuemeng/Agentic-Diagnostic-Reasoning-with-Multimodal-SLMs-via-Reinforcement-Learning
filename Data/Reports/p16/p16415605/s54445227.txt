                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, supraventricular tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  The aorta remains tortuous but
 unchanged.  Minimal leftward deviation of the trachea is attributable to known
 multinodular thyroid goiter.  The hilar contours are normal, and the pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Except for subsegmental atelectasis in the lung
 bases, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No congestive heart
 failure.
