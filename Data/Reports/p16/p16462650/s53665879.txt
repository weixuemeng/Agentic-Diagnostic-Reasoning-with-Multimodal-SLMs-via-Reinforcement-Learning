                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with prior exams from ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead pacer
 is unchanged.  Patient's chin obscures the superior mediastinum and lung
 apices.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, similar to prior radiograph. 
 No convincing signs of pneumonia, though the lung bases are partially
 obscured.  No large pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
