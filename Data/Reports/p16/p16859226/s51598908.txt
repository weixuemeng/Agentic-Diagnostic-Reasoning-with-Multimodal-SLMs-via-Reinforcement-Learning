                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:49 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after thoracolumbar laminectomy.  Assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Left lung is reasonably well expanded and shows no pulmonary edema.  The right
 lung base, particularly medially is consolidated.  One would expect
 atelectasis at least early post-operatively.  Heart is moderately enlarged and
 mediastinal vessels widened the mediastinum.  ET tube in standard placement. 
 No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion is small on the right if any.
 
 Spring-loaded device projects over the right lower lobe bronchial tree. 
 Subsequent chest radiograph should be taken with care to clear this area to
 exclude the possibility of aspirated material.
