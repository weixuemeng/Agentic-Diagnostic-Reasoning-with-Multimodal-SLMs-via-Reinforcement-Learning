                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  Lung volumes have
 improved, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Moderate cardiomegaly and
 mild fluid overload.  Areas of atelectasis at both the left and right lung
 bases persist.
