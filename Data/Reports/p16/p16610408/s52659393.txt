                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board limits assessment.
 
 An endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating at the level of the carina. An
 enteric tube is coiled within the hypopharynx with side port in the proximal
 esophagus and tip in the mid esophagus. Lung volumes are low. There is
 moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette. Widening of the superior
 mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and supine positioning. Bilateral
 hazy ill-defined opacities may reflect moderate pulmonary edema though
 superimposed infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.  No displaced fractures are
 visualized.
