                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Possible stroke, left arm weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 relatively hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, which can be seen in
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis/scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild bi-apical pleural thickening.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD.
 2.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
