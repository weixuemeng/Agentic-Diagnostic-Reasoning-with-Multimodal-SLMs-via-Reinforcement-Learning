                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, rhonchi.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement remains as described earlier.  There
 is a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour, finding which in
 conjunction with the generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta is
 compatible with systemic hypertension.  All these findings are unchanged and
 presently there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Relatively
 low positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms are indicative of COPD and
 there exist some linear densities on the bases compatible with increased
 interstitial fibrosis.  There is, however, no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 infiltrates and no evidence of pleural effusions in the lateral or posterior
 pleural sinuses.  Previously described local rib changes in the upper axillary
 area on the right side persist and are compatible with old but no new skeletal
 injuries.  The retrocardiac rounded density in the midline compatible with the
 previously described moderately sized apparently fixed hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with moderate cardiac enlargement.  No
 evidence of acute pulmonary congestion.  No evidence of new acute pulmonary
 infiltrates.
