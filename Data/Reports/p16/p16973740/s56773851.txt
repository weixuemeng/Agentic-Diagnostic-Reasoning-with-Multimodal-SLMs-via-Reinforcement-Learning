                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary sequestration s/p wedge resection 
 // eval post op change      eval post op change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There has been a wedge resection of a pulmonary
 sequestration with a a right chest tube is now in place and no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour is seen. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion
 or pleural effusion. An area of opacification at the root left base probably
 represents atelectatic change.  Suggestion of a lucency beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm could possibly represent post -surgical pneumoperitoneum.
