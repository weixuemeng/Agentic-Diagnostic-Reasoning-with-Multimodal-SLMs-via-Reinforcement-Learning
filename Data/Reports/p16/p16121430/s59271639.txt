                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Single episode of constipation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is elevation of
 the anterior right hemidiaphragm.  There are scattered linear areas of opacity
 in the mid-to-lower lungs bilaterally likely related to atelectasis/scarring. 
 Mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to mild
 pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.
 There are no findings to suggest pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible
 mild vascular congestion.  Scattered linear atelectasis/scarring.
