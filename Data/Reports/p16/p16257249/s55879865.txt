                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating approximately 1.9 cm from the
 carina.  Enteric tube tip and side port terminate within the stomach.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lung
 volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  There is mild
 upper zone vascular redistribution which may be due to supine positioning. 
 Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Contrast is noted within the
 collecting systems bilaterally as well as within the left colon possibly from
 recent CT examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying, approximately 1.9 cm the carina,
 and should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm.  Enteric tube tip in standard
 position.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
