                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Autologous bone marrow transplant, recent viral pneumonia and
 hypotension to 60s.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
  
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  No focal opacification concerning for
 pneumonia identified.  New 2cm opacification projecting over the right upper
 lung adjacent to an overlying lead does not appear anatomic and is likely a
 lead clip, which could be confirmed with oblique views.  Finding was not seen
 on subsequent radiograph after central line placement.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Opacification projecting over
 the right upper lung is most consistent with lead clip.
