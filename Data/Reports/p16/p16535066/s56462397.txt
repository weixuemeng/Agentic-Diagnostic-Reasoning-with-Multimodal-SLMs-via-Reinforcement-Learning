                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with question lymphoma,
 autologous stem transplant 10 months ago and asplenia, currently with fevers.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___, and PET CT from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial
 opacities are noted on the current chest radiograph.  They can be appreciated
 at least partially on the prior PET CT from ___, but appear to
 be more pronounced than ___ chest radiograph.  The findings are
 nonspecific and might reflect the infectious process such as viral disease. 
 Mild non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema would be another possibility, but no
 signs of volume overload are demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  With those findings, especially if pulmonary infection
 clinical signs are present, correlation with chest CT should be considered.
