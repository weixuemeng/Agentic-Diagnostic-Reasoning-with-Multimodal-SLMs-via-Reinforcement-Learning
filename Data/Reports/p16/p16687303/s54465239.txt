 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluation for infectious process or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is unchanged evidence of
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Subsequent bilateral areas of
 atelectasis and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Signs of mild
 pulmonary edema that are constant as compared to previous image.  In the
 well-ventilated parts of the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of
 additional parenchymal opacities.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  To exclude
 the possibility of co-existing abnormalities, repeat imaging after resolution
 of the pleural effusions is recommended.
