                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. An
 opacity in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis as a result of
 suboptimal inspiration or infection.  The right lung is clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Pleural surfaces are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity could represent infection or atelectasis in the
 setting of suboptimal inspiration.  If suspicion is not strong for pneumonia,
 a followup chest x-ray at full inspiration can be obtained for no additional
 charge.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 16:45, ___ min after findings were made.
