                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and probable volume overload. 
 Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates adequate lung
 volumes with bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged, somewhat shifted to the right.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right greater than left basilar opacity, likely reflecting
 atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.
