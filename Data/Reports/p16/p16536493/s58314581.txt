                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To evaluate for findings of aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in
 patient with urosepsis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  There has been
 interval improvement in the degree of pulmonary vascular engorgement, however,
 a stably widened mediastinum suggests persistent central venous congestion.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A tortuous and unfolded aorta is once
 again noted, however, the possible presence of right aortic arch is more
 equivocal on this study.  There are persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube terminates in a
 lessened 3.6 cm above the carina and a nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm and inferiorly beyond the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 2.  Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
