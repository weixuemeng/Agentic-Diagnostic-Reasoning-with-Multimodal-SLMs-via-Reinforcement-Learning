                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, post-intubation.
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, AP:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm and inferiorly beyond the field of view. 
 Lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists, with a tortuous and unfolded aorta and probable right aortic arch. 
 There is probable central venous congestion, pulmonary vascular plethora, and
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2.  Nasogastric tube courses towards the right abdomen, which may reflect
 gaseous distention versus patient rotation.
 3.  Mild heart failure. Right aortic arch
 4.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
