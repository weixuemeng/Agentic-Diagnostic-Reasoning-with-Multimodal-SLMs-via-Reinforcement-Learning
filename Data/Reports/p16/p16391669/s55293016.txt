                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with trapped lung pleural effusion after previous
 drainage.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Left lung is entirely airless.  How much left pleural effusion is
 radiographically indeterminate, but since mediastinum is shifted
 ipsilaterally, the loss of volume due to atelectasis exceeds that replaced by
 pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear.  Right pleural effusion is small,
 layering posteriorly.  Vascular engorgement in the right lung is mild to
 moderate but there is no definite pulmonary edema.  Heart size is
 indeterminate.
