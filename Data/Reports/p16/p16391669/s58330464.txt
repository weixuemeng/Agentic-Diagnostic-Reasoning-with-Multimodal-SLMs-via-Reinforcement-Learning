                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided pacemaker with its leads in the right atrium and
 right ventricle are unchanged.  Mediastinal clips are stable.  Sternal wires
 are intact.
 
 There is persistent opacification of the left mid-lower lung, likely
 reflecting due to pleural effusion and consolidation. Allowing for changes in
 technique, it appears similar to the prior radiograph. The left apex appears
 to be normally aerated.  There is an increase in the intersitial markings,
 which may represent mild pulmonary edema. There is no right pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate due
 to the left-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Large left pleural effusion and subjacent consolidation, similar to the
 prior exams.
