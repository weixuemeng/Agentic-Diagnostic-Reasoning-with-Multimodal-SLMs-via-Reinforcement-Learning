    1. Large right lower lung consolidation with adjacent small pleural effusion
  appears increased compared to the prior examination suggesting new concurrent
  pneumonia.
    2. Smaller left base consolidation with adjacent small effusion may be
  atelectatic or represent additional focus of pneumonia.

 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 2:15 AM
  
  1. Large right lower lung pneumonia with associated small effusion. Some of
  the findings may be associated with clinical history of a right lower
  paraspinal mass though no outside imaging is available for comparison.
  2. Smaller left base consolidation with adjacent small effusion may be
  atelectatic or represent additional focus of pneumonia.
  3. Central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. History of right lower paraspinal mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparisons studies are located under separate MRN which was
 later reconciliated with the temporary emergent MRN. Studies include several
 CT chest and chest radiographs dating from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size cannot be accurately assessed given large right lower lung
 consolidation with associated small effusion. Smaller left base consolidation
 with small effusion on the left.  Left base findings are new and right
 effusion and increased consolidation is noted compared to prior. Lung apices
 are clear. No pneumothorax. Central pulmonary vascular congestion without
 frank interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large right lower lung consolidation with adjacent small pleural effusion
 appears increased compared to the prior examination suggesting new concurrent
 pneumonia.
 2. Smaller left base consolidation with adjacent small effusion may be
 atelectatic or represent additional focus of pneumonia.
 3. Central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.
