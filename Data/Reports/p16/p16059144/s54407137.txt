                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest CT without contrast.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is not well evaluated given right hemi thorax opacification.
 Thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded. Central pulmonary vascular congestion with
 interstitial edema. Opacification of nearly the entirety of the right hemi
 thorax corresponds to a combination of paraspinal mass, probable atelectasis
 and right effusion. Left base atelectasis and left effusion is small. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Partial opacification of the right hemi thorax corresponds to a combination
 of mass, probable atelectasis and effusion on same-day CT. Mild left base
 atelectasis with adjacent small pleural effusion.
 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema.
