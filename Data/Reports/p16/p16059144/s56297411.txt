                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea  // r/o infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there has been interval progression of disease. There is a
 approximately 12 cm AP by 12 cm CC rounded density within the right lower
 lobe. There is also likely some superimposed component of atelectasis given
 subtle right-sided volume loss. On prior exam from ___ there had been a 2.5
 cm nodule in this region in addition to a sub- carinal density which on the
 current exam cannot be differentiated. On today's exam, there is also a new
 right apical pulmonary nodule projecting over the posterior right fourth rib.
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval enlargement of previously known masses since ___.
 Probable superimposed component of postobstructive atelectasis. New right
 apical pulmonary nodule.
