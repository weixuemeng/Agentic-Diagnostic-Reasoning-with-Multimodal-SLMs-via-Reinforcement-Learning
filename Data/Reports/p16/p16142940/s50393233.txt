 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a persistent small to moderate right effusion with increasing
 airspace opacity more suggestive of atelectasis rather than an infectious
 process. Linear opacity in the left lower lung likely reflects scarring. There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart remains enlarged which may
 reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation is advised.
 No pneumothorax.
