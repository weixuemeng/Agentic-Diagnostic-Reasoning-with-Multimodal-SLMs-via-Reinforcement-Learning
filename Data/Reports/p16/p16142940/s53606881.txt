                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, worsening effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion is slightly increased in size compared to the
 previous study. Trace left pleural effusion is likely unchanged in the
 interval. Compressive bibasilar atelectasis is re- demonstrated.  The heart
 size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large right pleural
 effusion. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely throughout the
 thoracic aorta. No pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There is no
 pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in size of large right pleural effusion and
 relatively unchanged trace left pleural effusion. Bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis.
