                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R effusion s/p ___  // r/o ptx      r/o
 ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 16 37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size but residual small to moderate right pleural
 effusion status post thoracentesis.  No pneumothorax.  Heart remains stably
 enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should
 also be considered. Mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification of the
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Streaky
 opacities at the left base and more focal patchy opacity at the right base
 likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
