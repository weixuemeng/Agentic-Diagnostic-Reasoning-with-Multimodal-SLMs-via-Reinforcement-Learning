 Three sequential AP supine chest radiographs were obtained, demonstrating
 attempted placement of nasogastric tube which ultimately terminates within the
 stomach.  In all, the endotracheal tube, mediastinal drains, left chest tube,
 and Swan-Ganz catheter are in satisfactory position.  Median sternotomy wires
 appear intact.  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema is seen with left greater
 than right small pleural effusions but no pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is
 mildly enlarged.
