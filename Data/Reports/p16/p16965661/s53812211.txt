                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with presumed fall down ___ foot wall. 
 Evaluate for intrathoracic injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest rib graft was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, likely reflecting chronic pulmonary disease.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The heart is normal in size.  A
 well-circumscribed round opacity along the right heart border may reflect a
 Bochdalek's hernia.  Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch, and no
 displaced rib fractures are seen.  S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar
 spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  .
