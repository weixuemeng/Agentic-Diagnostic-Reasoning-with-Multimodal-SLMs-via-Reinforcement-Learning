 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Symmetric nodular densities over the lower lungs are
 similar to prior and consistent with nipple shadows.  Saber sheath
 configuration of trachea and hyperinflated lungs suggest COPD.  There is small
 atelectasis or fluid in the right major fissure.   There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
