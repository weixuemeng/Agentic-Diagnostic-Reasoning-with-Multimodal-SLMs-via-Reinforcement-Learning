                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest show mild opacity in the right lung
 base which could represent atelectasis or a developing infectious process. 
 The rest of the lungs are clear although hyperexpanded indicative of
 emphysema.  The hilar, mediastinal, and cardiac contours are normal.  Slightly
 tortuous descending thoracic aorta is noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
