                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with coagulopathy and renal failure, w/ worsening
 o2 requirement  // please eval for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing parenchymal opacities. 
 Predominating at the lung base on the right have progressed.  A milder
 progression is seen with regard to the left retrocardiac opacities.  The
 slight asymmetry of the changes as well as the absence of other signs
 indicative of pulmonary edema suggest the presence of pneumonia.  The presence
 of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.
