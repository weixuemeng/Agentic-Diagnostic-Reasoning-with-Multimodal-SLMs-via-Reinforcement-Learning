                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man COPD, CHF, recent multifocal HCAP now with
 continued hemoptysis and O2 requirement.  // Is the pt's PNA resolving, and/or
 is there a new pulmonary process that could account for his symptoms?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT chest without contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left PICC with the tip in the cavoatrial junction.  The bilateral
 interstitial pulmonary edema has improved, although it persists.  There are
 bibasilar opacities.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 right.  Increased AP diameter suggests hyperinflation.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left PICC in appropriate positioning.
 2.  Improving interstitial pulmonary edema, with bilateral pleural effusions
 due to CHF.
 3. Bibasilar patchy opacities, which could represent atelectasis or
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 4. Hyperinflation due to COPD.
