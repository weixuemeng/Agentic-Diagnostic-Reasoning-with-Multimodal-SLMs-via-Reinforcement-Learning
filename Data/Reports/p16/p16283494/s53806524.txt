                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with confusion states he has "pneumonia"
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Moderate emphysema is re-
 demonstrated.  Ill-defined focal opacity within the peripheral aspect of the
 right upper lobe appears grossly unchanged.  New ill-defined opacity is seen
 within the lingula.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Multiple clips are again seen in the region of the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New patchy opacity within the lingula which may reflect pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting or new area of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
 2. Residual focal opacity within the periphery of the right upper lobe
 compatible with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
