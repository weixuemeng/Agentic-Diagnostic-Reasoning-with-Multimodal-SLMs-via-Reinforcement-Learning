                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rales, evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are again hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragm, but otherwise clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  If a large, centrally umbilicated soft
 tissue density projecting over the left axilla isn't an external artifact it
 is a large, ulcerated lestion in the left chest wall, presumably abscess or
 traumatic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Hyperinflation suggestive
 of COPD. Possible large left chest wall lesion, easily evaluated clinically.
