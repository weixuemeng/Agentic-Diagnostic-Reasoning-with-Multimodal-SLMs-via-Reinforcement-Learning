                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, rhonchi, and expiratory wheeze in
 left and right lower lobe, to rule out pneumonia, infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest views were reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small subtle opacity in the left mid lung which is appreciated only
 on the frontal view is suspicious for early  pneumonia.  Right lung is clear. 
 Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined, small opacity in left mid lung is concerning for an
 evolving pneumonia.
