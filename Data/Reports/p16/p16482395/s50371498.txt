                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, pleuritic CP, evaluate for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and chest CT dated
 ___ peer
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe hyperexpansion is consistent with COPD.  Biapical nodular pleural and
 parenchymal scarring is similar to the prior chest radiograph chest CT.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Airspace opacity
 with bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe is unchanged from multiple prior
 studies and likely related to prior right middle lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Severe hyperexpansion consistent with COPD.
 2. Biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring and right middle lobe
 bronchiectasis, similar to prior studies.
 3. No focal consolidation.
