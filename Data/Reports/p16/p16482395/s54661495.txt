                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary MAC and RML bronchiectasis and
 intermittent hemoptysis  // assess for any progression     assess for any
 progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ read
 in conjunction with chest CT most recently ___.
 
 Compared to ___, the consolidation in the right middle lobe (which was new
 from the chest CT in ___ which showed only bronchiectasis in that
 region), has cleared.  There was also consolidation in the previously normal
 lingula, and a small region in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe,
 both of which have since resolved.  There is however the suggestion of new
 bronchiectasis where we saw lingular consolidation in ___ and a small
 elliptical opacity in the right upper lobe, interposed between the anterior
 second and third ribs that could be a newly impacted dilated bronchus.
 
 In summary, what was probably acute multifocal pneumonia, perhaps in regions
 of preexisting bronchiectasis, has cleared since ___ but the possibility of
 new bronchiectasis in the left lung and right apex would require chest CT for
 confirmation.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 substantial central adenopathy.
