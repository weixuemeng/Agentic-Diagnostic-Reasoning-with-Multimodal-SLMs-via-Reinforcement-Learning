                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ F PMHx HTN, active tobacco use who presented to ___
 with x1 month of non-productive cough/SOB with imaging concerning for new RUL
 lung mass  // Eval lung mass, assess for pleural effusions, assess for
 cardiomegaly
 
 COMPARISON:  Spine MRI ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right upper lobe collapse is consistent with a post obstructive process and is
 accompanied by apparent right mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Known obstructing
 lesion is more fully evident on separately dictated MRI of the spine.  Lungs
 are otherwise remarkable for upper and mid the zone reticular and nodular
 opacities with some associated architectural distortion suggesting chronic
 fibrosis.  Heart size is normal, in the thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Rounded
 opacity just above the level of the diaphragm probably reflects a hiatal
 hernia.  Right hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated.  No pleural effusion. 
 Known expansile masses in the thoracic spine have been more fully assessed by
 separately dictated MRI of the spine from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Postobstructive collapse of right upper lobe secondary to centrally
 obstructing mass, more fully evaluated by separately dictated MRI of the spine
 from ___.  Dedicated contrast-enhanced chest CT would be helpful for
 more complete assessment when the patient's condition allows.
 
 2.  Known thoracic spine metastases have been better evaluated on the spine
 MRI.
