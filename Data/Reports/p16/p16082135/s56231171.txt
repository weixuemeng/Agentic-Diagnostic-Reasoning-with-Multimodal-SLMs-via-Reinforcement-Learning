                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent cardiac surgery for iatrogenic laceration of the
 ventricle, now with shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, large heart border.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to portable frontal chest radiograph performed
 same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given differences in patient positioning, exam is largely unchanged
 with bilateral moderate pleural effusions, left greater than right with
 associated bibasilar atelectasis.  No dense focal opacification concerning for
 pneumonia identified, though examination is limited by overlying effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged exam with bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
 opacification, likely atelectasis though cannot definitively exclude
 pneumonia.
