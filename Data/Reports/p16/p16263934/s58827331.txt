                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD 8 AVR, POD5 PPM  // LLL effusion      LLL
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 07:26
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer, nasogastric tube,
 and endotracheal tube. Dual lead left-sided pacer remains in place. The heart
 remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial
 effusion should also be considered.  Lung volumes remain low with layering
 effusions and bibasilar patchy opacities which could reflect compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. Crowding of the
 vasculature but no pulmonary edema is evident on the current study.  No
 pneumothorax.
