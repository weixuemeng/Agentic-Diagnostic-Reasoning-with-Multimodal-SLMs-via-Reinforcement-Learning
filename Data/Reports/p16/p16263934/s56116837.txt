  Endotracheal tube and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed. Right IJ remains
  in place. Endotracheal tube has been removed. Bibasilar opacities likely
  reflect small layering pleural effusions and atelectasis. There is worsening
  left retrocardiac opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragm. Mediastinal contours
  stable. There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AVR  // r/o ptx, s/p ct d/c      r/o ptx,
 s/p ct d/c
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and Swan Ganz
 catheter have been removed.  Right IJ sheath is in place. There is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure. Retrocardiac opacification obscuring the hemidiaphragm is consistent
 with volume loss in the left lower lobe with probable pleural effusion.
