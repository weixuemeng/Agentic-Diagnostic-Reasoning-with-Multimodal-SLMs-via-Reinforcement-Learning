 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the post-operative period

 The marked increase in width of cardiac silhouette could reflect a
 post-operative pericardial effusion.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is

 atelectasis, as well as apparent increase in size of a small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion.  Similar appearance of right pleural effusion.
