                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M POD1 AVR s/p CT placement with diminished breathsounds on
 left side.  // ?ptx      ?ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little interval
 change. Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette process with some elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent
 with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable pleural effusion.
 Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
