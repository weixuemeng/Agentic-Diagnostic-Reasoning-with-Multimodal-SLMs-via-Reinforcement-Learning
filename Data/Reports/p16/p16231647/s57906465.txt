 INDICATION:  ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pacer/ICD leads are unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is similar to the prior examination. 
 Patchy opacification of the right lower lung, increased, likely represents
 atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded.  A moderate size left
 pleural effusion is larger in the interval, and there is a trace right pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased moderate left pleural effusion and trace right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Increased opacity at the right base likely represents atelectasis however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
