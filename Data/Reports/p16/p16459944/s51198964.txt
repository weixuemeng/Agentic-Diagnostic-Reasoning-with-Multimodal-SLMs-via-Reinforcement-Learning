 HISTORY:  CHF, status post thoracentesis, question pneumothorax.
 
 Compared with ___ at 17:56 p.m., there has been considerable improvement
 in the right-sided effusion.  There is increased opacity at the left base,
 consistent with increased collapse and/or consolidation and slight increase in
 the small left effusion.  Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring is consistent with CHF, also slightly worse.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
