                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left Port-A-Cath without blood return, eval port placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable frontal chest x-ray and fluoro image from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 A left chest Port-A-Cath has its tip terminating in the upper SVC.  There is
 no evidence of catheter fracture.  The apparent difference in position of the
 port seen in prior radiograph is likely due to projectional differences, as
 the port position is comparable to intra-procedural fluoro image obtained on
 the same day.  A small granuloma is seen in the anterior left lower lobe,
 confirmed by CT scan on ___.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left chest Port-A-Cath with its tip in the upper SVC without
 evidence of complications.
