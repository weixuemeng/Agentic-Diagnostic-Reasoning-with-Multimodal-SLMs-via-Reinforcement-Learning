                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Known pneumonia, presenting with persistent cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is coarse hazy and streaky opacification involving the
 right mid to lower lung.  Opacities the left lower lobe and lingula are not
 specific and could be seen with atelectasis or bronchopneumonia.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated, and noting irregular pulmonary architecture, emphysema is
 suspected.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes
 are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung opacities, without prior studie for comparison, which may
 be due to acute infection but more chronic scarring could yield a similar
 appearance.  Irregular pulmonary architecture and scarring are concerning for
 emphysema.
