                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___. Comparison is also made
 with an outside abdominal CT from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic cancer, CHF, COPD, assess for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was provided portably.  Nodularity
 and scarring is better assessed on CT abdomen and pelvis from earlier today
 and likely accounts for the subtle opacity in the lower lungs.  There is upper
 lobe lucency compatible with emphysema.  The heart appears within normal
 limits in size.  Mediastinal contour appears unremarkable.  Imaged bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema with nodularity in the lower lungs better assessed on
 CT abdomen and pelvis from earlier today.
