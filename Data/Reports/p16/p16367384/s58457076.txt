                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a subdural hematoma, likely narrow surgical
 intervention, preoperative film.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, and a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  There is
 significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current film.  Allowing
 for these limitations, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal
 limits.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
