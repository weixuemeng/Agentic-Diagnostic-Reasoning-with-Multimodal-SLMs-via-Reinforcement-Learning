                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lungs are reasonably well expanded with
 persistent right lower lung opacity decreased in conspicuity from the previous
 examination, which could reflect scarring from prior pneumonia; however,
 recurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Interstitial prominence likely
 reflects chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiomegaly and dual-lead pacer are
 unchanged with extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Trace
 right effusion or pleural thickening may also be present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobar opacity could reflect scarring from prior
 pneumonia, though recurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.
