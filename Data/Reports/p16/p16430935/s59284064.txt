                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  Question cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is in a similar position.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and mildly tortuous.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  A mild diffuse interstitial abnormality is not as prominent
 as on the prior study but suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Subpleural scarring at each lung apex is unchanged.  The bones are
 demineralized with similar S-shaped curvature and a moderate-to-severe lower
 thoracic vertebral body compression deformity.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative
 changes along each shoulder are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion but improved.
