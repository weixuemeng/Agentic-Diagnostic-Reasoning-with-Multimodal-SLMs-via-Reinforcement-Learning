                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with question of seizure, altered mental status,
 and on Coumadin.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pacer unit sits in the left upper chest wall with leads in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is enlarged, possibly
 due to exaggerated effects of AP positioning.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.  The lungs show no
 consolidation, although vascular prominence and subtle diffuse hazy appearance
 of the lungs suggests some degree of pulmonary edema, increased since the
 prior study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Imaged lower
 thoracic vertebral body severe compression is unchanged compared to prior
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with mild vascular congestion/pulmonary edema
 which appears mildly increased compared to prior study, but no definite
 evidence of pneumonia.
