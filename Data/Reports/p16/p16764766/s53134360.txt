                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall.  Evaluate for infiltrate, fractures.
 
 .
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 are well-expanded and clear.  There is no large pleural effusion or focal
 consolidation. The appearance of retrosternal region at the level of the
 manubrium on the lateral view would raise concern for pneumothorax, but there
 are no supportive findings on either the frontal CXR or the upper chest imaged
 on a Cervical spine CT 30 minutes later, available at the time of this review.
 To confirm the absence of a pneumothorax a repeat upright CXR is recommended
 within twelve hours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Recommend repeat CXR to confirm absence of pneumothorax. Dr ___ paged at
 8:30 am.
