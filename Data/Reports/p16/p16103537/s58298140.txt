                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, weakness, on coumadin  // Eval for
 intracranial hemorrhage; pneumothorax/rib fx; fracture, or injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest wall pacemaker is present with leads within the right atrium and
 right ventricle. Lungs are well-expanded.  Opacity projecting over the left
 lateral chest may represent overlapping soft tissue.  Otherwise there is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 slight is unchanged. Large hiatal hernia is again re- demonstrated. Old right
 rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity over the left lateral lower lobe may represent overlying soft tissue
 but atelectasis or early infection is also possible.
