                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary hypertension, CHF, now hypoxia.  Question edema,
 infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___, chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is more confluent opacity at the right lung
 base medially.  However, on the prior film, this appeared to relate to a
 hiatal hernia.  Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle has improved
 considerably if not cleared.
 
 There is minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity and slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, which is new compared with the prior film.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change. 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle,
 prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, and suspected background COPD is
 unchanged.  No CHF. Enlarged left and ? right pulmonary hila, consistent with
 pulmonary hypertension.
 
 Old healed right posterolateral rib fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity at the right base is thought to represent a hiatal hernia, which
 is now completely fluid-filled.  If desired, lateral view could help to
 confirm this.
 
 2.  New minimal patchy opacity and blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
 
 3.  COPD, cardiomegaly, and enlarged left and ? right pulmonary hila,
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 4.  No evidence of CHF.
