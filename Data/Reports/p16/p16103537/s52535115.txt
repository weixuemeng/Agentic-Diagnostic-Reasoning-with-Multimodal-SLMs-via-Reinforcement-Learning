                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Mild
 cardiomegaly is again noted. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with a tortuous thoracic aorta again noted. Large hiatal hernia is
 re- demonstrated. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacity in
 the right mid lung field likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Minimal blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles on the lateral view is relatively unchanged, and may
 reflect chronic pleural thickening or tiny amount of pleural fluid. No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified. Remote right rib fracture is again detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from prior.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia. Large hiatal hernia.
