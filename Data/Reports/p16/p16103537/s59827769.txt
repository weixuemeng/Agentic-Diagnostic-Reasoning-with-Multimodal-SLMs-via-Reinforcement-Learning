 again seen with adjacent atelectasis. There is blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle suggesting small pleural effusions, underlying
 consolidation not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Again

 fractures were better seen on the prior study, likely due to differences in
 patient position.
