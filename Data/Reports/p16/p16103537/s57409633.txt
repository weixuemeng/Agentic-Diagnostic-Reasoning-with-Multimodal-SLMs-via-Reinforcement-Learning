                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-supine AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. Again noted also is a two-lead
 pacemaker/ ICD device. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged. A hiatal hernia is much more prominent on this study and more
 visible along the right cardiophrenic sulcus. There is persistent
 opacification obscuring the left costophrenic angle. This may represent
 pneumonia but with no short-term change. A trace pleural effusion is difficult
 to exclude on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent opacity in the lateral left lower lung, possible pneumonia.
 Follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution. Large hiatal hernia.
 New central venous catheter terminating in the superior vena cava; no evidence
 of pneumothorax.
