                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS, hypoxia  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, likely some combination of layering effusions
 and atelectasis with possible superimposed consolidation. Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged particularly on
 the left in the region of the AP window. While some of this may be technical
 due to patient rotation and AP positioning, followup will be necessary. Left
 chest wall dual lead pacing device seen with lead tips projecting over the
 right atrium and right ventricle. Old healed right lateral rib fractures are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely in part due to effusions with possible superimposed
 atelectasis and/or infection.
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette as above, potentially accentuated by
 patient positioning and technique however repeat will be necessary when
 patient is amenable, preferably with PA and lateral.
