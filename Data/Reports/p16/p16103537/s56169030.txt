                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart failure, reduced breath sounds on the right, effusion versus
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is minimal atelectasis at both bases,
 which appear more pronounced.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded, but unchanged. 
 Again seen is a large hiatal hernia, which projects to the right of midline --
 based on a CT from ___, this has been described as an axial hernia. 
 Small amount of posterior pleural effusion/thickening is unchanged.  No CHF. 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Old healed right-sided rib fracture is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis, that is more prounounced, but no obvious
 infiltrates.  
 2.  Small posterior pleural effusion/thickening is unchanged.
 3.  Large hiatal hernia, unchanged.
