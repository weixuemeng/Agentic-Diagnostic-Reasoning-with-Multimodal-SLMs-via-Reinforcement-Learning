                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___
 through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There are stable severe
 interstitial reticular-nodular opacities present, consistent with known
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Interstitial opacities consistent with known chronic interstitial
 lung disease. No obvious superimposed pneumonia.
