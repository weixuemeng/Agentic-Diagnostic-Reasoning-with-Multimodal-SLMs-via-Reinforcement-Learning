                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fevers.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Coarse reticular opacities in bilateral lungs limits evaluation of
 lung parenchyma for subtle pneumonia. No large opacity.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.  Pleural surfaces are normal
 without evidence of pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited evaluation for subtle pneumonia given chronic interstital lung
 disease and absence of prior images. Comparision with prior studies would be
 helpful.
 2.  Bilateral coarse reticular interstitial opacities is consistent with
 chronic interstitial lung disease.
