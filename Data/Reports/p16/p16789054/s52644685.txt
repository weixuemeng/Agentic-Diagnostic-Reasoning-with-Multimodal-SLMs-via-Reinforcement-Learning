                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of interstitial lung disease, poor historian
 reports with 10 days of cough and epigastric pain lll crackles on exam  // r/o
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT chest dated ___ and multiple
 intervening chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Extensive fibrosis is again noted
 consistent with known I LD, not significantly changed from the prior chest
 radiographs and CT dated ___. Difficult to evaluate for a superimposed
 pneumonia though no new dense consolidation is identified. No large effusion
 or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged.
 The trachea is deviated to the right at the level of the superior mediastinum
 though this is unchanged. Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially stable pattern of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis without overt
 evidence for superimposed acute process.
