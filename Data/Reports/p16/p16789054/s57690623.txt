                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of interstitial lung disease with shortness of breath and
 hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lung volumes remain
 reduced with increased interstitial opacities predominantly within a
 peripheral and basilar distribution compatible with chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  Findings are relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam, with
 no new focal consolidation demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic interstitial lung disease,
 relatively unchanged compared to the previous exam.
