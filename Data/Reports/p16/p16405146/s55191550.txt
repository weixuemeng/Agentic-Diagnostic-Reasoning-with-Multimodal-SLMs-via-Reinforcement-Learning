                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic CHF, increased dyspnea,
 bilateral rales.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement, similar as
 on previous study.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen; however, a
 double contour on the frontal view within the cardiac shadow suggests some at
 least moderate dilatation of the left atrium.  Dilated and elongated thoracic
 aorta with calcium deposit in the wall at the level of the arch as before.  No
 local aortic contour abnormalities are identified.  No evidence of acute
 discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Mildly increased
 interstitial pattern on the lung bases, similar as they existed before.  In
 addition, there exists some mild thickening of the pleural spaces bilaterally,
 and very mild degree of blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.
 Significant pleural effusions, however, are not identified and there is no
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Since the preceding examination, the patient
 has received a left-sided permanent pacer in anterior axillary position
 connected to one intracavitary electrode seen to terminate in the right
 ventricle touching the anterior right ventricular wall at the beginning of the
 outflow tract.  The position is acceptable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New single electrode pacer in place, moderate cardiac enlargement
 as before.  Slightly increased wetness of the pleural spaces, but no evidence
 of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema and no new discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.
