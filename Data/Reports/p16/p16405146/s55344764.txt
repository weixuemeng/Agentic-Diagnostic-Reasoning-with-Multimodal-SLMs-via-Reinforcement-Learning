 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute kidney injury, new orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the orogastric tube has
 been exchanged.  The current tube shows a normal course, the tip projects over
 the middle parts of the stomach.  There is no evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  New mild bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  No other relevant changes.
