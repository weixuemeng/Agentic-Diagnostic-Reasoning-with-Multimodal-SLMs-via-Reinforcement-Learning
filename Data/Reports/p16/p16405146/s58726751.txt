 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams  // pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Examination is somewhat limited secondary to patient positioning. There are
 very low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Again seen
 is opacification in the left base, which likely represents a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  The left effusion is likely partially
 loculated. Pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Right lung is clear except for a nonspecific patchy opacity at the base. The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. A pacemaker device is present, with a
 single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle.  Right lung apex
 and superior mediastinum are obscured by overlying structures due to flexed
 position of the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study secondary to patient positioning. Opacification of the left base
 may represent a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, however
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Repeat
 radiograph with improved positioning may be helpful for initial further
 evaluation.
