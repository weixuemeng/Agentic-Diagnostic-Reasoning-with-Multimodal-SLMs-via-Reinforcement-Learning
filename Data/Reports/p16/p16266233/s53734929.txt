                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with short of breath and right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and moderate right pleural
 effusion have both increased since ___.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 has remained stable and there is no pulmonary edema or left pleural effusion. 
 Change in size of the cardiac silhouette could be due to progressive
 cardiomegaly and/or the previously small pericardial effusion.  Mediastinal
 venous caliber has decreased, so the likelihood of cardiac tamponade is small.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings by telephone at 1:30 p.m., when the
 findings were reviewed.
