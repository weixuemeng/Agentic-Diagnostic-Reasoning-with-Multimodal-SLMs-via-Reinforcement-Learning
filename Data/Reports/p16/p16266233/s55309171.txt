                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man with new oxygen requirement, mild
 pericardial effusion, and pulmonary effusion, edema and consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared with chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest shows interval reduction of lung
 volumes with new left lung base opacity, probably due to left lower lobe
 aspiration.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is probably due to small
 pleural effusion.  Right lung is otherwise clear.  Heart size is still
 enlarged with stable mild vascular congestion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left lung base opacity might be due to spiration.  New small
 left pleural effusion and stable cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.
