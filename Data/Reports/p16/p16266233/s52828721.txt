                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new onset of AFib and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Previously seen right PICC
 is no longer visualized.  There is new small patchy opacity at the left lower
 lung laterally, not seen clearly on the previous exam.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 are grossly clear.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is, however,
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, suggesting mild cardiomegaly.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the left lung laterally, potentially
 atelectasis, although infection could be considered in the proper clinical
 setting.  Mild cardiomegaly.
