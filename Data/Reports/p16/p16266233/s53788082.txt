                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o effusion s/p right thoracentesis  // eval for
 pneumothorax, status of effusion after drainage
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ 10:15.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller, and there is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly has improved since ___, stable since
 earlier in the day. Pulmonary vasculature remains engorged and the pulmonary
 interstitium is mildly abnormal, both are probably chronic. There is no
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia, and I doubt that the patient is in acute
 pulmonary edema.
