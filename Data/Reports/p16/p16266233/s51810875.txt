                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by improved pulmonary vascular
 congestion and decreased pulmonary edema with only minimal residual
 interstitial edema remaining.  A more confluent area of airspace opacity in
 the left mid and lower lung has resolved in the interval.  Right hemidiaphragm
 appears elevated, and it is uncertain whether this represents true
 diaphragmatic elevation or a subpulmonic component of the patient's pleural
 effusion that was demonstrated on CT of ___.  There is some
 residual blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulcus posteriorly.  If
 warranted clinically, right lateral decubitus view could be obtained to better
 quantify the amount of pleural effusion.
