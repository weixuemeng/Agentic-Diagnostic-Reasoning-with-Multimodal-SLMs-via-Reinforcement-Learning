                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AI/AS s/p AVRm  // eval ETT and CT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Newly placed ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles, roughly 4 cm
 above the carina. The patient has had prior median sternotomy with aortic
 valve replacement. The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the level of the main
 pulmonary artery. Bilateral chest tubes are in place.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The right pleural effusion has slightly decreased, but there is
 a new small layering left pleural effusion. New retrocardiac airspace
 opacification is likely due to atelectasis. However, infection or aspiration
 would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical context.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly placed ET tube terminates in the mid trachea.
 New left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity may be due to atelectasis,
 infection or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Decreased small right and new small left pleural effusion.
