                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is reportedly status post thoracentesis, with decrease
 in size of left pleural effusion with residual small effusion remaining. 
 Curvilinear interface in upper left hemithorax strongly favors a skinfold over
 a pneumothorax, but repeat radiograph may be helpful to confirm this
 impression if warranted clinically.  Moderate, partially layering right
 pleural effusion is not appreciably with persistent adjacent lung opacities in
 the right mid and lower lung region.  Mild interstitial edema is also
 demonstrated.
