 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, fever, evaluation for pneumonia or
 pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the extent of the
 bilateral known pleural effusions have substantially increased.  The effusion
 now occupies around half of the right hemithorax and one-third of the left
 hemithorax.  The pre-existing signs indicative of mild pulmonary edema
 persist.  New areas of rather extensive atelectasis have developed at the lung
 bases.  No evidence of pneumonia.
