  Bilateral effuions.  Hazy opacification at the bilateral bases may be due to
  mild pulmonary edema or atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with oxygen desaturation status post blood
 transfusion, pathologic left hip fracture from metastatic breast cancer, rule
 out pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest on ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Since the prior study, the patient has undergone a median sternotomy with
 aortic valve replacement.  The heart appears upper limits of normal in size
 given portable technique.  Lung volumes are lower, and there is prominence of
 the interstitium which may reflect age-related changes, small airways disease
 or smoking-related changes.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is more
 patchy, streaky opacity at the left base which could reflect an area of patchy
 atelectasis or post-inflammatory scarring, although an acute infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded.  Both costophrenic angles appear mildly
 blunted and therefore raise the possibility of small bilateral effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema.
