 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:38 PM
  New focal area of consolidation left lung base potentially pneumonia in the
  proper clinical setting.
  
  Focal opacities in the right upper lung laterally and at the apex unchanged
  from prior exams from ___.  
  
  As previously recommended, follow up CT scan is suggested and can be used to
  follow resolution of the left lung base opacity after treatment if
  administered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with possible altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT and x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is a peripheral area of
 scarring and extrapleural fat abutting the right upper lung laterally.  At the
 right lung apex is an asymmetric opacity when compared to the left which
 correlates with right apical scarring on CT and as similar compared to prior
 chest x-ray.  There is however a new focal area of opacity at the left lung
 base likely within the lingula on the lateral view.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New focal area of consolidation left lung base potentially pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.
 
 Focal opacities in the right upper lung laterally and at the apex unchanged
 from prior exams from ___.  
 
 As previously recommended, follow up CT scan is suggested and can be used to
 follow resolution of the left lung base opacity after treatment if
 administered.
