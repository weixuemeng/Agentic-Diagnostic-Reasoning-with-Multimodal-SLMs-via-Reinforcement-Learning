 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Continued patchy opacity is demonstrated within the
 lingula which remains concerning for pneumonia.  Chronic opacities are seen
 within the right apex and lateral right upper lobe, unchanged from the chest
 CT from ___.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular congestion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is
 demonstrated.

 Little interval change compared to the previous radiograph.  Continued patchy
 opacity within the lingula remains concerning for pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
