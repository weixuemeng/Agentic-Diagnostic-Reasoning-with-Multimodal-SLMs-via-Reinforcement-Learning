                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, congestive heart failure, presenting with worsening
 shortness of breath for two days, evaluate for pneumonia versus pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  No cardiomegaly evident.  There are new
 bibasilar opacification, left greater than right, which may be related to
 worsening chronic lung changes given the appearance of background emphysema;
 however, developing infectious process is a consideration.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax evident.  No osseous abnormality evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Background emphysematous changes.  New bibasilar opacifications
 left greater than right may reflect worsening chronic lung disease, though a
 developing infectious process or aspiration are considerations.
