                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD and increased sputum output.  Suspect left
 lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Peribronchial opacification at both lung bases, best appreciated on the
 lateral view is new since ___, consistent with pneumonia.  Followup
 advised for a posterior nodular component projecting over the lower thoracic
 spine.  Lateral view also shows heavy calcification of the mitral annulus
 possibly extending into the mitral valve, warranting clinical evaluation for
 possible calcific aortic stenosis, even though heart size is normal and the
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 
 Hyperinflation and deficient vasculature in the upper lungs is an indication
 of emphysema.  Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 4:25
 p.m., 1 minute following recognition of the findings.
