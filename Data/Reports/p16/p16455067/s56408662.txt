 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with
 emphysema.  Ill-defined opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with
 pneumonia.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural
 effusions.  The aorta is tortuous.  The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged,
 as before, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup after treatment is
 recommended in six weeks.
