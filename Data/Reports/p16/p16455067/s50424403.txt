                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and COPD with reduced breath sounds on the left.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been clearing of
 the atelectatic changes at both bases.  Hyperexpansion is again consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease, though there is no evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
