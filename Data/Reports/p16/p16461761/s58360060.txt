 ?EDEMA ?EFFUSION
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparisons.  Please note that comparison to old films can be

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 03:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  However, the heart does appear mildly enlarged which
 may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  Lungs appear relatively well inflated with streaky opacities at
 both bases likely reflecting atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 large effusions or pneumothoraces.  Bilateral shoulder replacements.
