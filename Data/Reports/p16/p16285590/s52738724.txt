                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  A small left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lung
 atelectasis has improved compared to the ___ study.  Peribronchial
 parenchymal soft tissue in the right lung has also improved.  There is no
 vascular congestion, pulmonary edema, right sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and blurred by the
 distribution of the pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  On the recent
 chest CT from ___, the heart size was normal.  Effusion and
 atelectasis seen adjacent to the heart on the recent CT account for the
 apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on this study.  Haziness of the
 left aortic contour is likely due to adjacent atelectasis, seen on the recent
 CT.  Surgical clips in the left lower thorax are from the patient's prior
 thoracic duct ligation.  There are no concerning osseous or soft tissue
 lesions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving small left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower
 lobe atelectasis.
