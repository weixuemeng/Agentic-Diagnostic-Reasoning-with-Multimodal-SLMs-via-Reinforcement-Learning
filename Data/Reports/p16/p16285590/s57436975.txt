                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains moderately to severely enlarged, slightly
 increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph.  The mediastinal
 contour appears unchanged compared to the prior radiograph.  Moderate size
 left pleural effusion with a component loculated laterally appears minimally
 increased compared to the prior study.  Persistent left paramediastinal
 opacities compatible with prior radiation changes are again noted as is a
 consolidative opacity in the left lung base.  Right basilar peribronchial
 opacities persist.  No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen
 and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight increase in linear
 opacities in the left mid lung field may reflect atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent moderate size partially loculated left pleural effusion,
 slightly increased compared to the prior study, with unchanged left basilar
 consolidation concerning for an infectious process.  
 
 2. Right basilar peribronchial opacities also persist and likely reflect
 bronchial inflammation and/or infection.
