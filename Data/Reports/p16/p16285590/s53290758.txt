                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for pneumothorax, patient with chest tubes and
 history of metastatic large cell carcinoma, thoracotomy, decortication and
 pleurodesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary edema has markedly improved.  Left
 perihilar and bibasilar opacities have also improved.  Small left effusion is
 probably present.  Two left chest tubes are in place.  Mediastinal widening
 has improved.  Cardiac size is difficult to evaluate given the lung
 abnormalities.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.
