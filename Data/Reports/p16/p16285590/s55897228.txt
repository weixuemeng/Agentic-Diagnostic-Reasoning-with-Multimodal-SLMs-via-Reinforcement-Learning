                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath, after thoracic duct ligation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and multiple prior studies.
 
 The heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  The patient appeared
 to be slightly overhydrated on the prior study, with improvement on the
 current examination.  There are no new consolidations to suggest interval
 development of new pneumonia.  Loculated pleural effusion, post-radiation
 changes, and left lower lung consolidation are unchanged.
