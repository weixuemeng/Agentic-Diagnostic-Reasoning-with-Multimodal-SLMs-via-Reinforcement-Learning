                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post talc pleurodesis for recurrent left chylothorax. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Postradiation changes along the aortic arch are not appreciably changed. 
 Loculated left pleural effusion is bigger.  Right upper lobe and right lower
 lobe consolidations appear to be improving.  The cardiac silhouette, although
 partially obscured by the left pleural effusion, does not appear to be
 significantly changed.  The mediastinal silhouette is similarly stable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Enlarging left loculated pleural effusion, now moderate in size. 
 
 2. Right lower lobe and right upper lobe consolidations are improving.
