                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, midsternal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated and there is mild left
 basilar atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There
 are possible deformities of the lateral left second through sixth ribs which
 may be sequela of prior trauma.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Deformities of the left second through sixth ribs, no priors for
 comparison, but findings could relate to prior trauma.  Left basilar
 atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.
