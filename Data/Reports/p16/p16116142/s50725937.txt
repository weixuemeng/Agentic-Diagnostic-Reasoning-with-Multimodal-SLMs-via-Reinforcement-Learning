                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal failure  // please eval for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Previously present pulmonary edema has resolved, with mild residual
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left retrocardiac opacity has improved but
 there remains a nonspecific area of residual opacification in this region. 
 Although potentially due to resolving area of atelectasis, focus of pneumonia
 is not fully excluded in this region.  Small pleural effusions are present and
 have decreased in size since the previous radiograph.
