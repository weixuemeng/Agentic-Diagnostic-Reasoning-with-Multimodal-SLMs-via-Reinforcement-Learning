                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute hypoxia, post procedure, edema, effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, bilateral parenchymal
 airspace opacities with air bronchograms have appeared.  There is no
 substantial interstitial component to the opacities.  However, minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic sinus is observed, likely caused by a small
 pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has slightly increased. 
 There is perihilar haze bilaterally and an unchanged elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 The changes could be suggestive of both asymmetric pulmonary edema and
 pneumonia.  Close radiographic followup is recommended.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 8:24 a.m., on ___, the
 referring physician, ___. ___, covered by Dr. ___, was paged for
 notification.
