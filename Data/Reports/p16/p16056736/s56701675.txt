                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with prior CVA presents with weakness and
 sepsis  // eval for PNA - ? at R base on OSH CT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, right basilar opacities have
 substantially improved with associated decrease in extent of volume loss,
 favoring atelectasis is the most likely etiology. Within the left lung base,
 linear areas of atelectasis have improved, but a more focal patchy opacity in
 the retrocardiac region is apparently new. This may be due to localized
 aspiration, atelectasis, and less likely an early focus of infection. Small
 pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
