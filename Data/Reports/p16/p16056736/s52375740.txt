                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a new MI.  Concern for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Bilateral perihilar pulmonary consolidation is slightly worse today than on
 ___, and still more pronounced on the left than the right. 
 Nevertheless, the simplest explanation is that this is perihilar distribution
 of worsening pulmonary edema, rather than invoking a second diagnosis such as
 pneumonia or hemorrhage.  Heart is top normal size.  Mild mediastinal venous
 engorgement unchanged.  ET tube in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage
 tube ends in the stomach.  No appreciable pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax.
