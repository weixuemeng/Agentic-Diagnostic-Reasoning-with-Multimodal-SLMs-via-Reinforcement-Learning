                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and leukocytosis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but there
 is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No definite focal pneumonia. 
 On the lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased opacification at
 the base in the retrocardiac region.  This may well represent only crowding of
 vessels and mild atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
