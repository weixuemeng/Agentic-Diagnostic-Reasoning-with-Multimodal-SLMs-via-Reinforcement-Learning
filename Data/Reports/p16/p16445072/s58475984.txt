 Lung volumes remain quite low.  There is new atelectasis at the right lung
 base and persistent opacification on the left, probably substantial left lower
 lobe atelectasis given downward displacement of the left hilus.  The upper
 lungs are clear.  There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.  If there is concern
 about chronic airway obstruction from retained or aspirated secretions, CT
 scanning would be required.  Heart size is top normal as before.
