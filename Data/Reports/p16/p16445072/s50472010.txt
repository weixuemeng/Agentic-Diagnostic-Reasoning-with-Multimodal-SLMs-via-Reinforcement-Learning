                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with EF of 45%, status post abdominal surgery. 
 Evaluate for effusions or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are significantly lower than on the prior study, resulting in bronchovascular
 crowding. Opacity at the left lung base is likely combination of tiny effusion
 and atelectasis but supervening infection cannot be excluded.  The upper lung
 zones are clear. No pneumothorax and no right pleural effusion. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable allowing
 for lung volumes. An abdominal drain projects over the left upper quadrant.
 Clips are seen in the thyroid bed after total thyroidectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity is likely a small effusion and atelectasis
 but supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. No edema.
