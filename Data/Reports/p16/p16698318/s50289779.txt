 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Ill-defined opacity is noted within the right
 lung base, which is concerning for an infectious process.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
