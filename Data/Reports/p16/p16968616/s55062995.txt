                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 
 ___M with question early pneumonia left lung vs. atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral view there is a new peribronchial opacity, likely corresponding
 to a right lower lobe opacity on the frontal view. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Peribronchial opacity on lateral view likely corresponding to a right lower
 lobe opacity, possibly atelectasis, but could represent early infection, if
 confirmation is needed oblique radiographs can be obtained.
