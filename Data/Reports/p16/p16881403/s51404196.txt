                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, fever.  // Please evaluate for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More than a score of a discrete opacities are present in the lungs, many of
 these are nodular, some are cavitated and some of those contain fluid, see for
 example an 18 mm wide lesion projecting posterior to the IVC on the lateral
 view. Interestingly the lower lobes are relatively spared, although I do not
 understand the significance of that distribution.
 
 Hilar adenopathy may be present. There is no large scale mediastinal
 adenopathy although conventional chest radiographs can overlook enlarged
 central lymph nodes. There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 Differential diagnosis includes septic emboli, with or without endocarditis,
 and disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection. It is also possible that
 these lesions may have preceded recent infectious symptoms, and therefore the
 differential diagnosis includes cavitated metastases; in a female patient of
 this age choriocarcinoma should be investigated.
 
 CT scanning might provide useful information, at the very least documenting
 the extent of cavitation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr. ___  by
 telephone on ___ at 9:03 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
