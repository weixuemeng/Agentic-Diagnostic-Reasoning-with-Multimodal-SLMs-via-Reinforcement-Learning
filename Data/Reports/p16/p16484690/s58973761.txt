                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and chills with history of diabetes and
 cirrhosis  // evaluation for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, likely reflecting atelectasis.  There
 is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
 Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar streaky airspace opacities which likely reflect
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude
 completely.
