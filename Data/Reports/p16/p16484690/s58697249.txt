  Lung volumes are low. There is chronic atelectasis in the right midlung. Heart
  is slightly larger than before possibly exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP
  technique; overall likely top-normal. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
  effusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PCB and autoimmune hepatitis, DMII,

 Is there underlying infection responsible for patient's alte
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are even lower lung
