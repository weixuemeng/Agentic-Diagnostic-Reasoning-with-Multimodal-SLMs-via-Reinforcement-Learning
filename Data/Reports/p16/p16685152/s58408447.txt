 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:10 PM
  Right PICC can only be visualized as far as the distal right brachiocephalic
  vein;  a lateral radiograph could provide further evaluation of the PICC tip
  position.  Feeding tube extends below the level of the diaphragm.
  Heterogenous opacities, more extensive on the right, are increased compared to
  ___, most consistent with moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.
   A concomitant infectious process cannot be excluded.  Moderate to large
  layering right pleural effusion is increased.  A small left pleural effusion
  is not significantly changed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:11 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Check PIC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Generalized opacification in the right hemithorax is due largely to increase
 in a large right pleural effusion projected over at least moderately severe
 pulmonary edema, seen better in the left lung.  Severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is stable.  A feeding tube passes into the stomach and out
 of view.  PIC line appears to extend approximately 2 cm into the left
 brachiocephalic vein ending near the midline.  No pneumothorax.  Feeding tube
 can be traced to the low esophagus, and since I cannot see the weighted tip,
 probably into the stomach.  No pneumothorax.
