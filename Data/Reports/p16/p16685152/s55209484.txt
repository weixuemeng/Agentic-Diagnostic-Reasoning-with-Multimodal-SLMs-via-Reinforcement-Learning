                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly, increased in size in comparison to
 prior study from ___.  Additionally, there is haziness in the pulmonary
 vasculature with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of
 increased central venous pressure.  Furthermore, there are bilateral pleural
 effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.  Bibasilar atelectatic
 changes are visualized.  No acute fractures.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette with moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left, are suggestive of congestive heart
 failure.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes.  However, findings may be related to
 aspiration.
