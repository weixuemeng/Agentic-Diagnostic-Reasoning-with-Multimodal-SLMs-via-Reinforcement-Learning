                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Severe consolidation is present in all lobes of the right lung, accompanied by
 some volume loss raising the possibility of bronchial obstruction.  Left lung
 is clear.  Infusion port suggests chronic intravenous therapy.  Would be
 useful to note if the patient has received radiation therapy for breast
 carcinoma which could explain some, but not all of the right lung
 consolidation.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Pleural effusion on the
 right is small if any.  Heart size normal.  Dr. ___ was paged as requested
 at 12:30, as soon as the findings were recognized.
