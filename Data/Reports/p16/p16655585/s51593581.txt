                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 earlier the same day at 4:23 p.m.  There has been interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube which is approximately 6 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube is seen to terminate at the GE junction and should be advanced.  The
 lungs are notable for an azygos lobe and fissure. Right mid lung opacity may
 be due to atelectasis given rapid interval development since prior exam two
 hours prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube 6 cm from the carina and can be slightly
 advanced.  NG tube terminates at the GE junction and can be advanced for
 optimal positioning.  Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 at 9:51 p.m. on ___ over the phone.
