                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is an opacity at the left lung base which likely
 reflects a moderate to large left pleural effusion and possibly adjacent
 compressive atelectasis, although consolidation is also possible.  Heart size
 is difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New moderate to large left pleural effusion with likely adjacent compressive
 atelectasis, although a consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
