                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left low chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities within both lung bases
 likely reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Hyperinflation of the lungs with
 attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings in the upper lobes suggests
 emphysema. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
