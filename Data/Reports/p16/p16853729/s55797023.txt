                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, rule out acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  There is mild blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, again seen, which may reflect pleural thickening or
 small pleural effusion.  Vague opacities within the right-mid lung may
 represent atelctasis or early pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or findings
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid lung opacity may be atelctasis but could be early
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
