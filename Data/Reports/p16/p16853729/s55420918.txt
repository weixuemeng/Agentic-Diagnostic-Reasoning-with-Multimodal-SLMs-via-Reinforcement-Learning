 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:44 PM
  Increased bibasilar opacities with bronchial cuffing, suggesting airway
  inflammation or potentially infection; developing bronchopneumonia also not
  exclude.  Mild wedging of an upper lumbar vertebral body, but apparently
  increased.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, back pain.  Question pneumonia or mass.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent radiographs from ___ as well as radiographs
 going back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is similar unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including a convexity along the right upper
 mediastinal contour.  Particularly since it appears stable over time, it can
 probably be attributed to tortuosity of the great vessels.  
 
 At both lung bases, but more extensive on the right than left, there are
 patchy opacities, fairly streaky in nature but extensive.  These are increased
 since the earlier examination and are accompanied by peribronchial cuffing. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 Suspected mild loss in mid thoracic vertebral body heights appears unchanged
 and probably coincides with demineralization.  The lower thoracic spine shows
 mild rightward convex curvature.  There is wedging of an upper lumbar
 vertebral body which may be increased somewhat, although the apparent
 difference may be due to differences in orientation.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increasing bibasilar opacities which could be seen with lower airway
 inflammation or infection, although developing bronchopneumonia is not
 entirely excluded.  
 
 2.  Mild anterior wedge compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction, likely L1; although probably chronic, potentially
 increased somewhat.
