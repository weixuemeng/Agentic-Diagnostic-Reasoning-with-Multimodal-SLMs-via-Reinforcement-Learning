                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart
 size remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous but stable.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with perihilar haziness. More focal
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, though infection in these
 regions cannot be completely excluded. Small left pleural effusion appears
 similar compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Mild
 loss of height anteriorly of an upper lumbar vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small left pleural
 effusion.  More focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection in these regions cannot be completely excluded.
