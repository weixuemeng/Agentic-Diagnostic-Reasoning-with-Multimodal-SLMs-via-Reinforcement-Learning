                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypertension, diabetes, dementia and
 worsening agitation, question interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 14:15.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 11:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Given patient rotation, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable.  The heart remains moderately enlarged and the aorta remains
 unfolded and tortuous.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The lungs
 appear grossly clear.  There is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
 which may reflect pleural thickening and/or a small pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  Prominent opacity in the right paratracheal region is felt to
 likely be vascular in etiology.
