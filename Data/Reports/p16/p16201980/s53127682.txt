                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia and likely IPF  // please eval for
 complications of PNA, interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in technique, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.
 
 The posterior lower lobe opacity seen on the lateral view may be slightly
 denser and more confluent.  Otherwise, allowing for technical differences, I
 doubt significant interval change  in the bilateral opacities.  No new
 superimposed opacity is identified.
 
 Doubt CHF.
 
 The 7.1 mm rounded metallic density overlying the right upper/mid abdomen is
 compatible with a foreign body (question more shrapnel).  On the lateral view
 from the prior study it lies posterior to the presumptive L2 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral multifocal patchy opacities.  The CT report suggested that the
 appearance is most suggestive of a fibrotic subtype non-specific interstitial
 pneumonia (NSIP).
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the posterior segment lower lobe opacity
 may be slightly more confluent.  Otherwise, the appearance is grossly
 unchanged compared with ___
