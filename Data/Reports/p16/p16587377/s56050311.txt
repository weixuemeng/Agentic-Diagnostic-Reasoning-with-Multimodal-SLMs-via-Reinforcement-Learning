 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p completion left pneumonectomy POD# 2, w Hct
 trending down, asymptomatic.  // eval inter change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 15:56.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The volume of fluid in the left pneumonectomy space is increasing, without
 contralateral mediastinal shift. However there may have been an increase in
 the volume of air loculations in the fluid. Although it is possible lead some
 of this gas may have migrated from previous location higher in the
 pneumonectomy space, it raises the possibility of communication either with
 the external environment or with the bronchial tree or esophagus.
 
 Heterogeneous consolidation in the right upper lobe, presumably spillover
 pneumonitis from the preoperative broncho pleural leak, has not cleared since
 surgery.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 1:52 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
