                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post left upper lobe segmentectomy with continued
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures and volume loss within the left
 hemithorax. Left-sided thoracotomy and pleural thickening remain similar
 compared to the prior study as does the consolidative opacity within the left
 lung base.  Peripheral opacity within the right upper lobe is worse compared
 to the prior chest radiograph, and present on the prior CT, compatible with an
 area of infection. Previously noted nodular opacities in the right lung base
 seen on CT are not well assessed on the current exam. No right-sided pleural
 effusion is demonstrated, and there is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Peripheral opacity within the right upper lobe compatible with infection is
 similar compared to the prior CT, but worse compared to the prior chest
 radiograph. Known nodular opacities noted in the right lung base on CT are not
 as well visualized on the current exam. Post- operative changes within the
 left hemi thorax are unchanged.
