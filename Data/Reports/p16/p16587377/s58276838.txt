                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent admission for pneumonia, now presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left upper lobectomy, apparently
 partial, as before, with associated volume loss including leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  A left apical
 cavity containing air and fluid appears similar in size although probably with
 more fluid and less air content than on the prior examinations.  Persistent
 posterior basilar consolidation is noted but similar to the recent prior
 examinations allowing for differences in technique.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation; no significant change.
