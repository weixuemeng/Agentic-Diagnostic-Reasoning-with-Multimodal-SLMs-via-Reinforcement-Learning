                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hematemesis and prior lung resection. 
 Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___ and
 chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate post-surgical changes
 related to prior left thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy.  There is
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, as before.  A new retrocardiac opacity in
 the posterior left lower lobe may be related to prior surgery, although
 infection cannot be excluded.
 
 The right lung is grossly clear, with persistent hyperinflation and slight
 leftward shift of the mediastinal structures.  The heart is normal in size. 
 An air-filled cavity within the left apex contains some fluid, similar in
 appearance to the prior study from ___.  Scarring in the right lung
 apex is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-operative changes related to prior left thoracotomy
 and left upper lung pneumonectomy.  Subsequently obtained chest CT shows no
 evidence of pneumonia.
