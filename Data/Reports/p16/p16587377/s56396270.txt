                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, left-sided chest pain for 4 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post left thoracotomy and left upper lung pneumonectomy
 with unchanged deformities of the left lateral ribs and chest wall. 
 Air-filled cavity within the left apex is re- demonstrated, but appears to
 contain increased opacification suggestive of increasing fluid. The size of
 this cavity is overall unchanged.  Leftward shift of mediastinal structures is
 re- demonstrated.  The heart size is normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacities in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis. 
 Scarring within the right apex is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacity within the left apical gas collection likely reflects
 increasing amount of fluid.  Left basilar streaky opacity, likely atelectasis,
 although infection is difficult to exclude.
