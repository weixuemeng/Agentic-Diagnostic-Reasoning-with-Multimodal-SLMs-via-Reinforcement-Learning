                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided chest pain  // pneumo?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been continuing opacification of the
 left hemi thorax, as expected, at the site of the prior left pneumonectomy. 
 Again seen is evidence of left-sided volume loss, including complete leftward
 displacement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, leftward displacement of the
 trachea and carina, and elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  Leftward herniation
 of the right lung is also again seen, slightly more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  Again noted is deformity of the left thoracic cage and multiple
 surgical clips, consistent with prior surgery.
 
 On the right, again seen is pleural parenchymal opacity along the right lung
 apex and right upper chest wall.  This appears slightly more pronounced,
 though this appearance could also be an artifact due to differences in
 technique.  No new area of right-sided pleural parenchymal opacity is seen. 
 No CHF, other focal opacity, or gross effusion is identified.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Status post left pneumonectomy, with evidence of volume loss, slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior study.
 3. Pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex.  This is similar to
 the prior study, though is could be slightly more pronounced allowing for
 technical differences.  If clinically indicated, more direct comparison could
 be performed based on CT appearance.
 4. Otherwise, the right lung is grossly clear, without CHF,  other focal
 opacities, or effusion.
