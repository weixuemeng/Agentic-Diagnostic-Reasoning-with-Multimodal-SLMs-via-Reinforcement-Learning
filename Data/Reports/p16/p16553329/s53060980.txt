                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Slurred speech and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Scattered calcifications
 within the upper lung fields bilaterally likely reflect the sequela of prior
 granulomatous disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is likely minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.  There are mild degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine as well as within the imaged left AC joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
