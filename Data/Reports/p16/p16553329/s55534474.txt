                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Large bilateral pleural
 effusions are present with adjacent opacities most consistent with compressive
 atelectasis.  Cephalization and indistinct appearance of the pulmonary
 vasculature are consistent with pulmonary edema.  Heart size is not well
 assessed but appears enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema with bibasilar opacities consistent with moderate
 to large pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
