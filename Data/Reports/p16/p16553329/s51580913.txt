                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and small bilateral
 pleural effusions which have decreased in size compared to the previous exam. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but infection
 is not fully excluded.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, and
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection, however, within the lung bases cannot be
 completely excluded.
