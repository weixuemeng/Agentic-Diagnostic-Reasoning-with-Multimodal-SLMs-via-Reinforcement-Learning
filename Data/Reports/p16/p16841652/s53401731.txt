                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are exceedingly low, which limits evaluation and
 results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Within this
 limitation, there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or definite focal
 airspace consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  A large amount of air is seen within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: No definite acute cardiopulmonary process accounting for low lung
 volumes.
