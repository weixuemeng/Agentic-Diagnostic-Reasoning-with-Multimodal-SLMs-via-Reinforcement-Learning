                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post four-vessel CABG, presents with dyspnea and chest
 pain.  Assess for infiltrate, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post CABG with sternotomy sutures midline and
 intact.  There is stable severe cardiomegaly.  There is minimal central
 pulmonary vascular congestion with mild bronchial cuffing suggesting an
 element of pulmonary edema.  There is interval increase in size of left lung
 opacification, likely a combination of increasing left effusion and left lower
 lobe collapse, though superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.  There is
 interval increase in still small right pleural effusion.  Faint right lower
 lobe opacification likely reflects combination of edema and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe cardiomegaly with increased left lung opacification
 likely due to worsening, now large, left pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Increase in right pleural effusion, though still small.  Mild stable if not
 slightly worsened pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
