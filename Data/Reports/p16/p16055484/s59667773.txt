                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued extensive
 opacification at the left base most likely reflecting a combination of pleural
 fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia could certainly not be excluded.
 
 The right lung is clear.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 that could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
