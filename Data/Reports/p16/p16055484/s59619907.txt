 opacity at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  There has been interval appearance of a patchy opacity at
 the right medial lung base, which is concerning for either atelectasis or a
 developing pneumonia.  The interstitial edema has improved.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The patient is status post median sternotomy, and
 the cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although the left
 heart border is obscured by the elevated diaphragm.  No pneumothorax is seen.
