                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of adenocarcinoma p/w recurrent
 effusion.  // PTX? Please ___ ___ ___ ___ once completed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 Prior chest CTs dating back to ___, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with vascular deficiency in the upper lobes suggest Left
 upper lung opacity corresponds to known left juxta hilar mass, better
 characterized on same-day and prior chest CT.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion, with possible loculation.  No appreciable effusion on the left.  No
 pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation.  Bibasilar opacities suggest, though
 infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical context.  Mild tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  Otherwise, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate right pleural effusion with possible loculation, better
 characterized on same-day chest CT.
 2. Bilateral lower lobe opacities suggest atelectasis, though aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.
 3. Hyperinflated lungs with vascular deficiency in the upper lobes, suggestive
 of emphysema.
 4. Left upper lung opacity corresponds to known left juxta hilar mass, better
 characterized on multiple prior chest CTs.
