                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, peribronchial cuffing and
 diffuse interstitial opacities.  Lung volumes appear relatively increased,
 suggesting the possibility of COPD.  Small pleural effusions are present
 bilaterally.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and spinal hardware is
 present in the imaged portion of the upper lumbar spine, incompletely
 evaluated on this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities are most likely due to
 interstitial edema in the setting of history of pulmonary edema on recent
 outside chest radiograph (unavailable).  Followup radiographs may be helpful
 after diuresis to confirm resolution and to exclude other causes of
 interstitial lung disease.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
