                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension, congestive heart failure with increased dyspnea and
 chest pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is worsening interstitial pulmonary
 edema compared to the previous exam, now mild to moderate in extent, with
 probable tiny bilateral pleural effusions which are unchanged.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of COPD.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Spinal fusion hardware within the thoracolumbar
 junction is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with
 probable unchanged trace bilateral pleural effusions.  As noted previously,
 follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended to assess for an
 underlying interstitial lung disease.
