 Improved bibasilar atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion compared to
 the prior radiograph, as well as a slight decrease in bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  Additionally, small loculated right
 lateral hydropneumothorax is apparently new compared to the prior radiograph
 of ___, but was clearly visible on earlier radiograph of ___.  Lack of visibility on the ___ radiograph may be due to
 positional differences.
