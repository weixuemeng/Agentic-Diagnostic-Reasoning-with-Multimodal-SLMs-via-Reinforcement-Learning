                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old lady with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis (Childs-___ Class B,
 MELD of 14 in ___) decompensated by gastric/esophageal varices, chronic
 hepatitis C (s/p ribavirin and sofosbovir with SVR), known HCC with previous
 radiofrequency ablation in ___, who is currently active on the transplant
 list, who is admitted for for Hemorrhagic Shock.  // Need to confirm OGT
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ 03:26, ___, ___.
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an orogastric tube which courses past the diaphragm and
 out of view with distal tip returning into view, pointing superiorly near the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions are likely stable given
 differences in positioning and layering of effusions obscuring the
 hemidiaphragms. Volume loss in the left lower lobe is stable.
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter appears kinked near the
 entrance into the skin which may be due to projection or kinking of the
 catheter.  Support lines are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Orogastric tube with distal tip pointing superiorly near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Repositioning so tip points inferiorly is
 recommended with confirmation of tube course with abdominal radiograph.
 2. Right internal jugular central venous catheter appears kinked near the
 entrance into the skin which may be due to projection or kinking of the
 catheter.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Orogastric tube with distal tip pointing superiorly near
 the gastroesophageal junction.  Repositioning so tip points inferiorly is
 recommended with confirmation of tube course with abdominal radiograph.
