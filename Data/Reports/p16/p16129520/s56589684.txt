                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax post thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier.  Moderate
 left pneumothorax is unchanged allowing for difference in positioning of the
 patient.  There are no other acute interval changes.
