                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain // eval mediastinum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The mediastinum appears widened especially comparatively to the most recent
 prior chest x-ray however some of this may be due to low lung volumes. The
 lungs are clear. There is no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widened mediastinum which could be secondary to many factors including low
 lung volumes however acute aortic pathology cannot be ruled out on the basis
 of this radiograph.
 
 On attending readout comment is also noted that the tissue posterior to the
 sternum was thickened. All these findings are probably due to low lung volumes
 and a repeat PA and lateral radiograph with full inspiration would be able to
 better assess the situation.
 
 Updated findings after attending readout discussed with ___ at
 8:36 AM via telephone. Initial findings discussed with ___ at 5:20 AM
 via telephone.
