                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  Coarse
 prominence of interstitial markings could reflect chronic lung disease,
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
 
 No definite acute focal pneumonia.  Central catheter is unchanged.
