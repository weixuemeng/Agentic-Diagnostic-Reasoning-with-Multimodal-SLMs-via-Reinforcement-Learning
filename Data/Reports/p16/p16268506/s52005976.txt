                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated at outside hospital with stroke.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This study is limited due to patient positioning.  An endotracheal tube is
 noted in the lower trachea.  A left internal jugular central venous catheter
 is noted with the tip at the mid SVC.  An enteric tube traverses with the
 side-hole at the gastroesophageal junction.  Evaluation of lung parenchyma and
 mediastinum is limited due to patient positioning.  The right mediastinum and
 paramediastinal area are abnormal with increased opacities of unknown
 chronicity. Additionally, there is evidence of mild pulmonary edema. No acute
 fractures are identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Limite study due to patient positioning demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 in the lower trachea.  Enteric tube tip is at the gastroesophageal junction,
 further advancement is recommended. 
 
 2.  Evaluation of lung parenchyma and mediastinum is limited due to patient
 positioning.  The right mediastinum and paramediastinal area are abnormal with
 increased opacities of unknown chronicity. A repeat film is recommended when
 possible for better assessment. Additionally, comparison to prior studies, if
 available, would be helpful.
