                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 device is noted with leads in unchanged positions in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly appears grossly unchanged. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely within the thoracic aorta. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema, perhaps minimally worse compared to the
 previous examination.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present
 however the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis
 however infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with mild pulmonary edema, perhaps slightly worse in the
 interval.  Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though
 infection is difficult to exclude.
