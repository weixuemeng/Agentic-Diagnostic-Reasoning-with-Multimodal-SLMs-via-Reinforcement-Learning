                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with difficulty weaning from vent  // ? pulm
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a left internal jugular line. A left
 subclavian catheter terminates at the origin of the SVC.  An endotracheal
 through the terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. Finally, an esophageal tube
 terminates in the stomach and should be advanced 3 cm for appropriate
 position.
 
 There is minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement with no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  A right mediastinal asymmetry is again seen, and is unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities are minimally worse from the prior study but likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Small pleural effusion on the left.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of edema.
 2. Esophageal tube terminates in the stomach and should be advanced 3 cm for
 appropriate position
