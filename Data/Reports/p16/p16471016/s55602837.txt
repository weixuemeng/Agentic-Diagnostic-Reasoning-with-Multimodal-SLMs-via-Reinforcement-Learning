                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infection in a patient with metastatic RCC with
 extensive lung involvement, presenting with low-grade fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs.  Extensive bilateral opacities are
 consistent with widespread pulmonary metastatic disease, with mild improvement
 of the left lung.  There is a new small to moderate right pleural effusion. 
 No obvious focal consolidation is identified, although a small focus would be
 difficult to identify given background parenchymal opacities.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No obvious focal consolidation to suggest infection, though difficult to
 exclude given extensive background parenchymal opacities.
 2. Small to moderate right pleural effusion.
