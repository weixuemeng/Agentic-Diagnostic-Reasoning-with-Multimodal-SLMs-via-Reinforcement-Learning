                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, shortness of breath, right upper back pain. Assess for
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates moderately well inflated
 lungs. Right lower lobe opacity is present.  The right hilar is prominent.
 Left lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. The aorta is tortuous.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Prominent right hilum could potentially represent reactive
 lymphadenopathy. Follow-up chest radiograph in 6 weeks after treatment for
 pneumonia is recommended. If persistent at that time, contrast-enhanced chest
 CT would be recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 2:23 AM, 5 minutes after discovery
 of the findings.
 
  The updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ QA nurses via
