 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, evaluation for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the cardiac silhouette and
 the left lung are constant.  On the right, however, there is a marked increase
 in transparency, likely reflecting a decrease in pleural effusion and improved
 ventilation.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
