                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with increasing oxygen requirement,
 saturation at 89% on 100% oxygen.  Evaluate increase of right-sided effusion?
 
 FINDINGS:  The examination is first presented for presentation on ___,
 i.e. more than 24 hours after the performance of the study.  The portable
 chest film again demonstrates the patient in significant right tilted position
 resulting in an ___ projection.  A previously described right internal jugular
 approach central venous line remains in unchanged position.  Cardiac
 enlargement as before and evidence of pleural effusion is seen on the right
 base with blunted pleural sinus structures.  The amount of pleural effusion,
 however, has not changed significantly.  Comparison of the pulmonary
 vasculature, however, demonstrates the vasculature is much more congested and
 has marked perivascular haze.  On the left side beginning central edema can be
 identified.  This congestive pattern has markedly increased since the next
 preceding study of ___ and indicates CHF in progression.
