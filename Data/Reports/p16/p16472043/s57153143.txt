 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Limited interpretation, given that the patient is unable to lay
 flat on her back.  The radiograph is rotated.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette appears unchanged as compared to the previous examination.  The
 right elevation of the diaphragm is unchanged.  However, a small right pleural
 effusion might have newly occurred.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumonia.  Unchanged position of the right internal jugular vein catheter.
