 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is a metallic density projecting along the base of the
 right neck near a central venous catheter that terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is mild interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary
 vascular congestion, but otherwise the lungs appears clear aside from a
 similar patchy right basilar atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
