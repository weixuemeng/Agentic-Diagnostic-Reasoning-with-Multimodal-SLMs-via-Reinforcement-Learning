 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Aorta is tortuous.  Lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Focal thickening
 of the pleura is noted in the left apex.  Followup of the patient in three
