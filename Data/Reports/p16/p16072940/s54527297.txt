                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural thickening seen on chest radiograph. 
 Followup study was recommended.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are viewed in comparison with the
 prior study from ___.  Slightly asymmetric pleural thickening at
 the lateral apices, left greater than right, appears stable.  No additional
 areas of pleural thickening are seen, and the lungs are clear and well
 expanded with no nodules or focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion is seen.
 There is some uncoiling of the thoracic aorta, but heart size is within normal
 limits.  Osteophytosis is seen in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Stable left lateral apical pleural thickening for 18 months.
