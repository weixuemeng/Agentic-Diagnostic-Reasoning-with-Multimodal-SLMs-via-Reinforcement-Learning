                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with asthma, shortness of breath, and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Linear density at the right lung base appears similar compared to prior and
 likely represents atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle appears unchanged compared to prior and may represent
 pleural thickening rather than effusion.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.
 Heart size is within normal limits.  There is mild flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms and expansion of the retrosternal airspace, suggestive of lung
 hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with basilar atelectasis.
