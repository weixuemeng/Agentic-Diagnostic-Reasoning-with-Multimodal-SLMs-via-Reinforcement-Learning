 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Streaky and linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar streaky and linear opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
