 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes persist.  The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged, and
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged, and
 the hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base is again demonstrated.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with anterior
 bridging osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
