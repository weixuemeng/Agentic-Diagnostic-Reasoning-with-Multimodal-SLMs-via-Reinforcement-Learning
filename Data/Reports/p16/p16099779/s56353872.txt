                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly with tortuous thoracic aorta and mild prominence
 of the right mediastinal contour is unchanged compared to prior examination. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low accentuating the
 cardiac silhouette and causing crowding of the bronchopulmonary vasculature;
 however, there is no overt fluid overload.  Lungs are otherwise clear with the
 exception of linear streaky atelectasis at the left lung base.  Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
