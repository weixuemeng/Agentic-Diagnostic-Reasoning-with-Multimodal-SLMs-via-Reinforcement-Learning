                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough and fever  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Allowing for low lung volumes,
 there is no overt evidence of pneumonia or CHF. There is mild retrocardiac
 opacity which is most compatible with atelectasis, though a very early
 pneumonia is impossible to exclude. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, difficult to
 exclude a very early pneumonia.
