 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 projects over the proximal parts of the stomach.  No evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged.
