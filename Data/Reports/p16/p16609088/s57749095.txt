                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___ and ___.  Chest radiograph dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates markedly decreased
 lung volumes, accentuating bilateral perihilar and scattered pulmonary renal
 cell carcinoma metastases.  Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung noted
 on CT from ___ may be beyond the resolution of current exam.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral pulmonary metastases may obscure subtle
 infection.  Given extent of metastatic disease, if there is lingering clinical
 concern for pneumonia, consider CT evaluation if indicated.
