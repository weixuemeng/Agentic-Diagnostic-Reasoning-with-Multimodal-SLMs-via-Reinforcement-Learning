                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are bilateral diffuse
 pulmonary opacifications superimposed upon the previous nodular pulmonary
 opacifications.  This suggests a developing consolidation.  Endotracheal tube
 lies only about 1.2 cm above the carina and should be pulled back several cm. 
 Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach.
