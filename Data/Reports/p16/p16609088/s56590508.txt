                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Again there are multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with
 metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Areas of more coalescent opacification on
 the right could well reflect an infectious process.
