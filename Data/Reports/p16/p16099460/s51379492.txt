                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, wheeze, questionable worsening pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains too large.  The lung
 parenchyma shows improved ventilation, but areas of parenchymal opacities in
 the right perihilar areas, in the retrocardiac lung area and in the right
 upper lobe persist.  The effusions, previously seen on the lateral image, are
 not visible on the current image.  No new parenchymal opacities.
