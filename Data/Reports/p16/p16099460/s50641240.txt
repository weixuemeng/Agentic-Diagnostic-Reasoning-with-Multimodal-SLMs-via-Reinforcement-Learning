                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CPAP, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:30.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is again noted with calcification of the aortic
 knob.  Pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval, now mild to
 moderate in degree with vascular indistinctness, perihilar haziness, and upper
 zone vascular redistribution.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, more so
 on the right common may reflect atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of mild to moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions and probable bibasilar atelectasis.
