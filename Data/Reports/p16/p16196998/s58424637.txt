                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with aspiration pneumonia and heart
 failure.  Signs of worsening pneumonia versus pulmonary edema?
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy, cardiac
 enlargement and previously identified left-sided permanent pacer with evidence
 of right atrial and biventricular pacing electrodes in unchanged position. 
 The previously identified  advanced interstitial edema with patchy densities
 in bilateral position has markedly improved.  No new local discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, nor is there evidence of increased
 pleural effusion in either lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of previously identified chronic pulmonary congestion
 without evidence of increased pleural effusion or development of acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Position of previously identified aortic
 valve - ascending aortic stent (CoreValve) appears unchanged.
