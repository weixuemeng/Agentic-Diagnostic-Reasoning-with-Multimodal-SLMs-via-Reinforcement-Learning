                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute on chronic heart failure and pneumonia.  Evaluate for fluid
 overload versus pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A left pectoral pacemaker is present with leads terminating in right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Sternotomy wires and an aortic valve stent
 (CoreValve) are unchanged.
 
 There are new, severe bilateral consolidations.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Assessment of the cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is limited by the severe
 parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: Recurrent, severe diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are most
 consistent with severe pulmonary edema, although, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage
 cannot be excluded.  Pneumonia is thought less likely.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:27 on ___ by telephone at the time of discovery.
