                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:06 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  CABG.  Left subclavian pacer upgrade. 
 Rule out complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs
 available, ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly may have increased slightly, but mild pulmonary edema
 and mediastinal venous engorgement are both new.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular leads follow same courses from the new left pectoral pacemaker as
 they did previously.  The new left ventricular lead probably ends along the
 posterior wall of the left ventricle.
