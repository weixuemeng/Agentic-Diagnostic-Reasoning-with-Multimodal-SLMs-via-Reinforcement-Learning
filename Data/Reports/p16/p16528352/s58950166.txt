 radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided PICC line ends at mid SVC.  A pleural pigtail catheter is present
 at right lung base.  No significant interval changes in the chest since ___.  Opacity at the right lung base which is likely atelectasis and
 presumed small residual effusion are stable.  Left lung is clear.  There is an
 evidence of prior median sternotomy.  Sternal sutures are intact.  Heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pneumothorax.
