                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with reported history of right-sided pneumonia, on
 tobramycin, presenting with hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 New from prior is consolidation within the right lower lobe.  There is also
 nodular density projecting in the right mid lung laterally measuring
 approximately 1 cm.  Patchy left base opacity on the frontal exam has improved
 since prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with infection in the
 proper clinical setting.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document
 resolution of this finding and of nodular opacity in the right mid lung.
