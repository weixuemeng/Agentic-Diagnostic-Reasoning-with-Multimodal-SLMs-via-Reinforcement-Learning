                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Streaky atelectasis is seen at the lung bases.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not fully imaged on the frontal view.  Pleural
 thickening is seen in the right posterior sinus.  The lungs are hyperinflated,
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  A 1.1 cm hyperdensity projecting over the
 right lung is redemonstration of the known scapular bone island as seen on the
 prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: Evidence of chronic lung disease without an acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
