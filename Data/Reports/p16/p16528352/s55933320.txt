                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___,
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing
 for marked patient rotation on the current study.  A 1-cm diameter opacity in
 the periphery of the right mid lung region may potentially represent a known
 sclerotic focus in the inferior right scapula shown on prior CT of ___ and previously projecting off of the lung on the prior chest x-ray of
 ___, which was more optimally positioned.  Lungs are otherwise clear,
 and there are no definite pleural effusions, although posterior costophrenic
 angles have been excluded from the radiograph, limiting assessment for small
 dependent effusions in this region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  1-cm nodular opacity in right mid hemithorax, likely representing a known
 sclerotic focus in the inferior right scapula.  Repeat chest radiograph with
 improved positioning may be helpful to confirm scapular location and to fully
 exclude a lung nodule in this region.
