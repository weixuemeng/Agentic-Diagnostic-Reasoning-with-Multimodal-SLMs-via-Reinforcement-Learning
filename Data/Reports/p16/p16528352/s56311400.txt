                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Left pigtail catheter is in place.  As compared to the prior study, there is
 unchanged or minimally decreased amount of right pleural effusion.  Minimal
 amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Lungs are well aerated. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of
 cavoatrial junction or potentially even lower, since its tip is not clearly
 seen on either lateral or PA view.
 
 Sclerotic focus at the tip of the right scapula, 12 mm in diameter, appears to
 be unchanged.
