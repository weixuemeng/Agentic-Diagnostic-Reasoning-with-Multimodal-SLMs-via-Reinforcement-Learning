                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated compatible with known emphysema.  A
 small right-sided pleural effusion is new compared with prior exam.  Streaky
 bibasilar opacities suggest bibasilar atelectasis versus scarring.  A nodular
 opacity in the soft tissues of the lateral aspect of the right thoracic wall
 is better assessed in prior CT and represents a sclerotic lesion within the
 scapular tip.  There is no pneumothorax.  The upper sternotomy wire is
 fractured, but the remaining sternotomy wires are intact.  Multiple surgical
 clips within the mediastinum correspond to prior surgery.  The aorta is
 tortuous, with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right-sided pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities may
 represent atelectasis versus scarring. No focal parenchymal opacities
 suggestive of pneumonia.
