 HISTORY:  Status post fall on chest 1 week ago.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate intact sternotomy

 dilated/tortuous, but unchanged since at least ___.  The well-aerated lungs
 are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No fracture is
 identified.
