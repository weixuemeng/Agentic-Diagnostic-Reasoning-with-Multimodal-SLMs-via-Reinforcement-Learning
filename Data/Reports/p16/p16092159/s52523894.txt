                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Trauma, evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No displaced fracture seen;
 however, if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, suggest dedicated rib
 series, which is more sensitive.
