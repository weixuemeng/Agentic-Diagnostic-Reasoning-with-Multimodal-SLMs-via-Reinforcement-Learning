                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart appears at the upper limits of normal size.  Streaky right mid lung
 opacities suggest thickening or minor atelectasis along the minor fissure. 
 There is possibly a trace pleural effusion on the left side only.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.  Kyphotic curvature appears exaggerated, but vertebral
 body heights appear preserved along the thoracic spine.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
