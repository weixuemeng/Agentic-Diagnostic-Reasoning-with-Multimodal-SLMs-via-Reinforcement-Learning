                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, with compressive atelectasis
 and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  No evidence of vascular congestion. 
 Overall, little change between the two studies.
