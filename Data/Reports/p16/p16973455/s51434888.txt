                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and left pleural effusion.  Right lung
 remains essentially clear.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
