 placement.
 
 A single portable supine chest film dated ___ at ___:___ is submitted and
 compared to prior study of ___ at ___:___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which has its tip
 seen just at the level of the carina.  Repositioning is recommended.  The
 endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  There continues to be low lung volumes.  Patchy airspace opacities
 at the medial right lung base, left peripheral lung and in the left base most
 likely reflect patchy atelectasis given interval changes from the prior study
 earlier today.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current study.  Results of
 this examination were conveyed by ___ to Dr. ___ by phone on
 ___ at 5:___ p.m.
