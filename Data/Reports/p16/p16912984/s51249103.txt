                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval for effusion      eval for
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion.  Opacification at the left base most likely reflects a combination
 of pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
