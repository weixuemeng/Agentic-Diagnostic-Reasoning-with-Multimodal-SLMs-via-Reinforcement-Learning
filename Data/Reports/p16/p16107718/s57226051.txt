                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible consolidation or edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing
 opacification at the bases posteriorly, consistent with pleural effusion. 
 There is vague suggestion of some increased opacification at the bases on the
 frontal view.  This could merely represent atelectasis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would certainly have to be
 considered.
