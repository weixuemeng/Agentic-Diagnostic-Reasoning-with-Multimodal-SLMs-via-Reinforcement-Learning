                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with nephrotic syndrome, chest pressure, fluid overload  //
 eval heart and lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent small bilateral effusions are seen, left greater than right not
 dramatically changed since last week's exam. Opacity in the retrocardiac
 region is likely due to atelectasis, similar to prior.  The lungs are
 otherwise grossly clear noting that the right lung apex is not assessed due to
 patient's overlying hair. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left-greater-than-right pleural effusions, not dramatically
 changed.
