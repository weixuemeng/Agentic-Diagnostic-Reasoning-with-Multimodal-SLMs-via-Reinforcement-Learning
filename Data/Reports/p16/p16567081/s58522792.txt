                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent pneumonia diagnosed and
 treated at another facility.  X-ray not available, now with continued cough
 and wheeze, history of COPD, remaining evidence of pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is seen.  The thoracic aorta is moderately
 widened and somewhat elongated but no local contour abnormalities are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exists,
 however, some irregular peripheral vascular distribution most marked on the
 bases and coinciding with some slightly hypertranslucent pulmonary areas and
 flattened low positioned diaphragms are indicative of COPD.  When direct
 comparison is made with the previous examination of ___, there is a hazy mild
 degree of density in the left base shows a corresponding local thickening of
 the lower portion of the major fissure on the left side.  This finding is
 consistent with some resolving pneumonic process such as recent pneumonia in
 resolution.  Skeletal changes which were characterized by some longitudinal
 calcification in the anterior ligaments of the thoracic spine appears stable
 and has not progressed.  No new skeletal abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings of general COPD as before, minor pleural and parenchymal
 hazy densities on the left base probably pneumonia in resolution and match the
 clinical report of a recent pneumonia.  If patient's symptoms continue,
 recommend another follow up examination in a week or so.
