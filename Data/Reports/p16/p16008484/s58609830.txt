                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis and leukocytosis.  New pleural effusion seen on CT.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiographs, new moderate pleural effusions have
 developed.  Patchy parenchymal opacities in the lower lobes are most
 suggestive of associated atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate pleural effusions with associated opacities
 suggesting atelectasis.
