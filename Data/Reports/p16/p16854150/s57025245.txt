                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement after intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine frontal chest radiographs demonstrate left chest wall pacing
 device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, sternal wires, and
 mediastinal surgical clips, grossly unchanged in position. Surgical clips also
 project over the lower right neck.  The endotracheal tube terminates within
 the mid thoracic trachea.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The lungs are fairly well
 aerated, with a persistent retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the medial
 hemidiaphragm. Hazy bibasilar opacities may represent layering effusions and
 or atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. Unchanged persistent retrocardiac opacity, which could represent
 atelectasis or infiltrate.
 3. Possible layering effusions and or atelectasis.
