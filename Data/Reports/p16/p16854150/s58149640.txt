                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC  // PICC placement      PICC placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 7:37 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PIC line passes at least as far as the upper SVC where it is obscured by
 pacemaker leads. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular leads are
 unchanged in their respective positions, including one orphaned right atrial
 lead.
 
 Lungs are substantially lower in volume than earlier in the day.  Atelectasis
 therefore probably accounts for greater consolidative abnormality at the right
 lung base.  Pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Pulmonary edema is mild
 if any, and  pleural effusions are small.  Heart is normal size. There is no
 pneumothorax. The trans esophageal tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.  There is no pneumothorax.
