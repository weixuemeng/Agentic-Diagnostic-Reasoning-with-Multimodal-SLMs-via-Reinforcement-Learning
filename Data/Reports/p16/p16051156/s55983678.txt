                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Apart from subsegmental atelectasis within the right middle lobe, the
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Rounded opacity projecting over the distal clavicle could reflect a bone
 island or area of heterotopic ossification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
