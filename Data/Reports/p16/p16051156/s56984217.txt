                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-extubation radiographs.  The patient had a recent cardiac
 surgery and air leak was seen on the left chest tube.  Concern for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  The patient has been extubated in
 the interim.  The right IJ catheter and NG tube have been removed. 
 Mediastinal drain and left-sided chest tube are stable in position.  Left
 apical pneumothorax is no longer visible.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 Pneumopericardium has decreased in the interim.  New left lower lobe opacity
 probably represents atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolved left apical pneumothorax.
