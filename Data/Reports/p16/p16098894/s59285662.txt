                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis and worsening ascites,
 productive cough  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previous right PICC line and left subclavian central venous catheter have
 been removed. Bibasilar consolidations are most likely due to atelectasis, but
 infection at the right lung base would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Lung volumes are low. There is no pneumothorax.
 The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, are most likely due to
 atelectasis, but infection at the right lung base would be difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
