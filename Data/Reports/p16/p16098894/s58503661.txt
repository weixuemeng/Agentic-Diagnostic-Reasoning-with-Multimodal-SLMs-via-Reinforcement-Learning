                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of cirrhosis, now presenting with
 abdominal distention.  Assess for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CT abdomen
 and pelvis from ___ at 3:09 a.m.  
 
 PORTABLE ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse increased opacity at the
 lung bases is likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation in this obese
 patient.  No pleural effusion is evident on the concurrent CT.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  No confluent opacity is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free
 air.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. No free air.
