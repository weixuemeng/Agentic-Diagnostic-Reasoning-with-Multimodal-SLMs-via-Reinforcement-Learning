                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cirrhosis who presents with volume
 overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a clear lungs bilaterally. When
 compared to prior study dated ___, there is decreased
 intravascular congestion. The lungs are low which exaggerates the size of the
 heart. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is mild prominence of the
 pulmonary vascular to suggest vascular congestion. No pleural effusion is
 seen. Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No overt pulmonary edema. Minimal vascular congestion as demonstrated by
 prominent pulmonary vasculature is probably not clinically significant.
