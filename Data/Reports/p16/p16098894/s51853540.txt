                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cryptococcal infection and acute
 respiratory failure status post intubation.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube ends at the carina, but neck is flexed so endotracheal tube
 should be withdrawn by no more than 2 cm.  Right PICC ends at the cavoatrial
 junction.  NG tube extends into the stomach.  Interval mediastinal widening
 likely reflects increased intravascular volume.  Low lung volumes.  Stable
 retrocardiac opacity reflects mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube ends at the carina and could be withdrawn by no more than 2
 cm to achieve standard placement.
 Interval mediastinal widening reflects increased intravascular volume.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 10:20.
