                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, assess for aspiration.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Widened mediastinum is slightly due to the position
 of the patient and the projection.  Ill-defined faint opacities in the left
 lower lobe could represent aspiration given the clinical concern.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
