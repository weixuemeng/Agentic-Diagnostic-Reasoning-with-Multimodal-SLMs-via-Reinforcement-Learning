                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: ___ year old woman with pleuritic chest pain, in the setting of
 recent trauma.
 
 COMPARISON: None
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is no
 free air under the diaphragm. No displaced rib fracture is seen. This study is
 not sensitive for subtle rib fractures, if there is high clinical concern for
 the same, a dedicated rib series can be performed with a marker placed at the
 site of maximum tenderness.
