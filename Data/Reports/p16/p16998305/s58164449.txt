                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are bibasilar opacities, which
 may reflect a combination of effusions and atelectasis, though pneumonia or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No
 overt interstitial edema is identified.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette
 is limited due to basilar opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, possible effusions and atelectasis, but
 pneumonia is also within the differential.  Formal PA and lateral may be
 helpful for further characterization.
