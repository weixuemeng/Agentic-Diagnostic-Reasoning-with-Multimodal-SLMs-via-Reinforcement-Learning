                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a retrocardiac opacity ascribed to pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 The lower pole of the right hilus is inseparable from a small region of
 atelectasis.  There has not been much change since ___.  I would
 recommend supplementing this study with a right anterior oblique chest
 radiograph (___), which would provide an additional image of the right hilus
 and the adjacent lung.  This could be a region of atelectasis or chronic
 aspiration.  If symptoms persist, I would recommend repeat chest radiographs
 in four weeks including PA, lateral and another ___ view.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic, but increased since ___.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is top normal caliber, but unchanged, and there is no pulmonary
 edema or radiographic evidence of pleural effusion or central lymph node
 enlargement.
