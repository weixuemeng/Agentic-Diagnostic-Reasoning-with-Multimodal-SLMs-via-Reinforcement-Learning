                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.  Previous diagnosis of pneumonia.  The patient
 also presents with new epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISONS: CT from ___ and 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours appear
 stable.  Again seen is a rounded opacity superimposed along the right cardiac
 border that appears similar to decreased and was previously shown to
 correspond to fluid and consolidation on the recent prior chest CT.  There is
 a small persistent left-sided pleural effusion, but substantially decreased. 
 A moderate right-sided pleural effusion has also decreased in size and is now
 small to moderate.  There is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung that is similar to better defined compared to the recent prior
 chest radiographs and may correspond to nodular focus along the right minor
 fissure seen on the CT study.  Patchy basilar opacities are nonspecific, but
 could be seen with a resolving infection or atelectasis associated with
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased pleural effusions.  Better defined nodule projecting
 over the right upper lung, of recent onset and potentially infectious or
 inflammatory in etiology.  Attention on followup radiographs is recommended to
 show resolution.
