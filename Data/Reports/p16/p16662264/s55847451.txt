 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with, DMI, IgG, renal transplant on
 immunosuppression, admitted with DKA and cough (with bilateral pneumonia), now
 with continued cough, evaluate progression of infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged.  The
 previously described pneumonic infiltrates located to the right middle lobe
 and left upper lobe lingula have progressed in extension.  New additional
 parenchymal infiltrates are now also seen in the left upper lobe apical
 segment and a few scattered small patchy infiltrates are observed in the right
 hemithorax mid lung field as well.  In addition, there is now clear blunting
 of the right and left lateral pleural sinuses extending into the posterior
 pleural sinuses as identified on the lateral view.  The pulmonary vascular
 pattern does not show increased congestion in comparison with the previous
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of previously existing bilateral parenchymal
 infiltrates and newly developed additional infiltrates are observed.  In
 addition, bilateral pleural effusions have developed in the absence of
