                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracentesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 7:20.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the patient has undergone a right thoracentesis. 
 The right pleural effusion has nearly completely resolved.  Patchy
 interstitial opacity at the right base likely represents some reexpansion
 edema and residual atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  A
 small left pleural effusion appears slightly larger than on the prior exam
 from earlier this morning.  Left basilar consolidation is likely atelectasis. 
 Other patchy bilateral opacities are unchanged, and consistent with the known
 pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significant interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  New right basilar consolidation is likely some reexpansion pulmonary
 edema.
 3.  Slight interval enlargement of small left pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis.
