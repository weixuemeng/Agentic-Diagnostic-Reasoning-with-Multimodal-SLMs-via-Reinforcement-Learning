                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with diabetes mellitus, patient with
 multifocal pneumonia and now increased tightness in chest.
 
 Wish to make sure that infection not worse as improvement is slowed with
 shortness of breath with minimal exertion.  Antibiotic therapy completed.  No
 fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits. 
 Unremarkable position of previously described left-sided PICC line terminating
 in mid portion of SVC.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no
 pneumothorax can be identified.  On previous examinations remaining multifocal
 density have generally improved.  In particular, a lesion identified on the
 last examination overlying the right upper lobe area laterally (third right
 intercostal space) has cleared up almost completely.  Densities located in the
 right middle lobe as well as those seen in the left upper lobe lingula
 persist, but have also undergone a slight improvement.  Again, no pneumothorax
 has developed, no new infiltrates are seen and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses remain free from any pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of multifocal infiltrates but persistent densities in
 right middle lobe and peripheral lingula.  Further followup examination must
 be guided by patient's symptomatology.
