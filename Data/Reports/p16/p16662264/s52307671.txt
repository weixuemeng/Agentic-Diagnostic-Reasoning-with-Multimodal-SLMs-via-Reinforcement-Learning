                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, tachypnea and reported infiltrate on outside film though
 not available for comparison.  Assess for infectious process or other etiology
 of hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low in volume. Congestion of the pulmonary vasculature,
 small bilateral pleural effusions and presence of septal lines reflects mild
 pulmonary edema.  Consolidations in the right mid lung and retrocardiac
 location could reflect a concurrent pneumonia.    Cardiac size is top normal
 with a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral consolidations could reflect a multifocal infectious process.
 2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema.
