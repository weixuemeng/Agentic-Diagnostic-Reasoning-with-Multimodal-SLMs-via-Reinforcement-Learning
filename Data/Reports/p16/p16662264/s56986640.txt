                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post bronchoscopy.  Bronchial
 aspiration biopsies in right upper lobe, right middle lobe, transbronchial
 biopsy of right middle lobe nodule, evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA
 and lateral chest examination of ___.  Comparison of the frontal
 views demonstrates increase of pulmonary parenchymal densities in the area of
 the biopsies, most likely caused by post-biopsy hemorrhages.  No other new
 pulmonary abnormalities are seen, and most importantly, there is no evidence
 of any pneumothorax on this single view chest examination.
