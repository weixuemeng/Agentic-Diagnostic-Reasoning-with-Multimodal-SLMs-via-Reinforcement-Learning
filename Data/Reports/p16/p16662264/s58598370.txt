                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, on immunosuppression, evaluate for
 recurrence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs show mild bilateral lower lobe confluent opacities with a new
 opacity in the right upper lobe.  The previously noted effusions have now
 resolved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged bilateral lower lobe opacities that could represent resolving
 pneumonia with a new focal opacity in the right upper lobe that is nodular in
 nature and should be re-imaged after adequate treatment to confirm resolution.
