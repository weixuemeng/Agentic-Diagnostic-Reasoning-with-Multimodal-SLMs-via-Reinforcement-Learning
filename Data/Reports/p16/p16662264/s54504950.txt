                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with diabetes, IgG deficiency,
 followup imaging for multifocal pneumonia suffered in ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and
 remains within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures
 are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  On previous
 examinations identified multifocal parenchymal infiltrates have further
 undergone marked regression.  There remain, however, some mostly linear
 densities in the areas of the previous infiltrates in the right middle lobe
 and left lingular area.  No new acute abnormalities are seen, no pleural
 effusion is identified nor is there any pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further improvement of previously identified multifocal pneumonic
 infiltrates.  As there persist a few remnants further followup is recommended
 to ascertain stability.
