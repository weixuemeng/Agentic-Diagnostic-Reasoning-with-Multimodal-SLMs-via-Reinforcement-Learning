                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known multifocal pneumonia status post thoracentesis with
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ at 13:28 and 7:20.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is a new thin linear density along the
 left apex, which may represent a pneumothorax.  Alternatively, it could be a
 skinfold.  Additionally, there are worsening basilar opacities, right more
 than left, likely due to pulmonary edema from re-expansion after the right
 thoracentesis.  Patchy bilateral opacities are otherwise not significantly
 changed.  There is stable small left effusion.  The right costophrenic angle
 is somewhat obscured by overlying monitoring lines, though there is likely a
 small right effusion.  There is no right pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear opacity along the left apex extending down laterally may represent
 a new pneumothorax.  Alternatively, it could represent a skinfold.  Recommend
 a repeat chest radiograph for further clarification.
 2.  Increasing basilar opacities, likely from worsening re-expansion edema. 
 There is a stable small left pleural effusion and likely a small residual
 right pleural effusion.  Scattered bilateral opacities are otherwise
 unchanged, likely reflective of the known multifocal pneumonia.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ (___ resident) at 5:10 p.m.
 on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
