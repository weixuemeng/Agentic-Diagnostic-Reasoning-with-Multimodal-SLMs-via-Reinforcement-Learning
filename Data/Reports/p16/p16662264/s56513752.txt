                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Resolving pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is progressive decrease
 in the opacification at the bases, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 resolving pneumonia.  However, there is still some opacification especially at
 the left base and overlying the cardiac silhouette.  This is consistent with a
 lingular consolidation.
