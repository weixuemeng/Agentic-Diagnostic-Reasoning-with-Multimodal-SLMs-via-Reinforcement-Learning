                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size remains enlarged.  Hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Endotracheal tube, upper enteric tube and left PICC remain in unchanged
 position.  Widespread multifocal parenchymal opacities remain unchanged from
 immediate prior study.  Subtle lobulated lucencies in the right mid lung are
 suggestive of pneumatoceles.  Left-sided pleural effusion is improved.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Multifocal lung infection persists, with possible pneumatoceles, but with some
 improvement of left pleural effusion.  If clinical improvement is uncertain,
 CT may be helpful to document changes.
