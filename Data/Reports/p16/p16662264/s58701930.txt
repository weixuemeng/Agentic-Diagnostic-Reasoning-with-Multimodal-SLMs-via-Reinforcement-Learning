                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with DKA and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Subtle increased density adjacent to the cardiac apex, with obscuration of the
 lower left cardiac border, has been present on multiple prior studies, and is
 thus likely chronic. No corresponding abnormality was identified on the
 lateral view performed one day prior.  There is no further parenchymal opacity
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or edema.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of lobar pneumonia.  Opacity adjacent to the cardiac apex at the
 left base appears to be chronic, though if there is concern for developing
 pneumonia radiographic follow-up would be appropriate.
