                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Self extubation, reintubated, question aspiration, check tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 On the current film, the ET tube extends to the origin of the right main stem
 bronchus and should be retracted approximately 2-3 cm.  An NG tube is present,
 sideport in the region of the GE junction or immediately distal to it and tip
 overlying the stomach.  
 
 Again seen are diffuse bilateral somewhat patchy alveolar infiltrates
 throughout the entire right lung and through most of the left lung, with
 relative sparing of the left upper zone.  Possible slight interval improvement
 in the appearance of the infiltrates, as the previously seen right middle lobe
 bronchograms are less apparent.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube at origin of right main stem bronchus.  Findings called to the
 ordering clinician, Dr ___, at the time of discovery at 5:36 p.m. on
 the day of the exam and discussed with her shortly thereafter (___,
 phone).
 
 2) NG tube tip overlying stomach, but sideport is at or immediately distal to
 the GE junction.
