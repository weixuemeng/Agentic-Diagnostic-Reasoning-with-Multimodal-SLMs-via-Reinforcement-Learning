 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bronchiectasis, exacerbation, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are slightly hyperinflated.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  There is widening of the bronchial
 structures and peribronchial thickening, predominating in the left upper lobe
 and the right lower lobe.  However, both the frontal and the lateral
 radiograph shows zones of diffusely increased parenchymal density, as expected
 in pneumonia.  Several calcified granulomas of millimetric ___ in the
 left upper lobe.  No other pulmonary nodules or masses.
