                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset pleuritic chest pain.  Assess for cause of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  The lungs are clear.  Bulging of the posterior
 cardiac border is redemonstrated.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Unchanged bulging of the posterior cardiac contour, possibly secondary to
 a mediastinal or pericardial cyst versus a cardiac abnormality.  Further
 evaluation could be performed with non-emergent CT or echocardiography.
