                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Small right upper lobe pneumothorax after lung biopsy, assess for
 resolution.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small right pneumothorax is unchanged in appearance from the prior
 study.  Small pleural effusion is also seen on the right as on the recent
 prior.  Hazy right mid lung opacity likely corresponds to a small amount of
 expected hemorrhage surrounding the biopsied nodule.  The left lung is clear. 
 The patient's known multiple nodules are better seen on CT.  There is no left
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged small right pneumothorax and pleural effusion following
 biopsy of right lower lobe nodule.
