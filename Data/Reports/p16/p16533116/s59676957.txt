                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right lower lobe nodule biopsy, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT-guided lung biopsy, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rounded ground-glass opacification of the left mid lung likely
 corresponds to a mild amount of expected hemorrhage following biopsy of the
 right lower lobe nodule.  Patient's additional nodules are better seen on the
 previously obtained CT.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  A small right
 pleural effusion is noted.  Old left rib fractures are noted.  The heart is
 normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-biopsy changes in right mid lung at site of nodule, likely
 due to post procedure hemorrhage. No evidence of pneumothorax. New small right
 pleural effusion could reflect a small hemothorax in the post-procedure
 setting. Findings discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___.
