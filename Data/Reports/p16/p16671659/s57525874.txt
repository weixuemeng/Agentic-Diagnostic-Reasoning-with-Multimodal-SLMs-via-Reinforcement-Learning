                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There are hazy bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, thought to represent effusions. 
 Indistinct pulmonary vascular marking is seen superiorly.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged moderately.  Severe degenerative change is seen at the
 right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely represent left greater than right
 effusions with moderate pulmonary edema.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette likely
 due to cardiomegaly, although underlying pericardial effusion could also be
 possible.
