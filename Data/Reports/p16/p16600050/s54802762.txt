                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:59 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with gluteal hematoma.  Fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New right infrahilar opacification could be early pneumonia.  I strongly
 recommend conventional radiographs as soon as feasible.  Moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly is exaggerated by AP supine positioning.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
