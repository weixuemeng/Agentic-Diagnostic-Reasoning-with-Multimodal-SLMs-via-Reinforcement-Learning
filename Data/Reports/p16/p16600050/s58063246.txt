 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of antiphospholipid syndrome presenting
 with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest, PA and lateral. The lung bases appear dense especially on the left and

 insufficient inspiration.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
