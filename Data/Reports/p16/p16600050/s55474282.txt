 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Low-grade fever and tachycardia, concerning for infection. 
 Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent and severity of
 the pre-existing known right lower lobe opacity has decreased.  However, the
 opacity is still clearly visible on both the frontal and the lateral
 radiograph.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be mildly
 enlarged, without, however, evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
