                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Addendum:  A well-circumscribed peripherally calcified opacity along the right
 aspect of the upper mediastinum is noted.  When compared with prior reference
 PET CT it appears to represent a calcified aneurysm near the origin of the
 right subclavian from brachiocephalic artery.  Could consider further
 evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with normal pulmonary vessels, suggestive of cardiomyopathy
 or possible pericardial effusion.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.
 
 There is a saber-sheath trachea as well as some loss of height of a lower
 thoracic vertebral body.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia.
