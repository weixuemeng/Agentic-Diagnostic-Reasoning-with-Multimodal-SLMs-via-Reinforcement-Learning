 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hip fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval, there has been an increase in extent and severity
 of the mild bibasilar opacities that likely reflect atelectasis.  Unchanged
 left-sided rib fractures.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.  Persistent
 bronchial wall thickening at the lung bases, suggestive of chronic airways
 disease.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
