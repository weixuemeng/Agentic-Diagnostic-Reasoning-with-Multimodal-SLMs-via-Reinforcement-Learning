                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Heart size is mildly enlarged with unfolding of the thoracic
 aortic arch.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a left lower lobe
 consolidation with suggestion of subtle air bronchograms.  More hazy opacities
 in the right lower lobe are likely atelectatic.  The lung apices are clear. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac consolidation with possible air bronchograms which may reflect
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical circumstance.
