                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Overdosed with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The
 heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, without overt
 pulmonary edema.  More focal opacification in the left lower lobe could
 reflect an area of atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  More focal opacity in the left lung base may
 reflect an area of atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.
