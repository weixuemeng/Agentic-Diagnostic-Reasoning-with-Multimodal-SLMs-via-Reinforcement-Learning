                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with failure to thrive admitted with L PICCL. 
 // Please confirm PICCL placement.      Please confirm PICCL placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 which may be responsible for the apparent increase in the size of the cardiac
 silhouette. Mild prominence and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises a
 possibility elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The left subclavian PICC line
 extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
