 cavoatrial junction.  There is extensive nodular metastasis noted bilaterally
 which is not significantly changed from the prior exam.  There is blunting of
 the right CP angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion.  No signs of
 pulmonary edema.  Difficult to exclude a subtle pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.  Sclerotic appearance of the vertebrae
 is consistent with known underlying metastatic disease.
