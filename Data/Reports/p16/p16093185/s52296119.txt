 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new chest tube  // placement of chest tube
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided
 pigtail catheter in the pleural space.  The catheter is in correct position. 
 The appearance of the lung parenchyma, both on the right and on the left,
 however, are unchanged.  Notably, the extent of the known small right pleural
 effusion is constant.  The extensive parenchymal opacities are unchanged in
 extent and distribution.
