 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the right atrium and
 lower SVC.  Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Hilar
 contours are stable. Innumerable nodular lesions in both lungs are similar and
 compatible with diffuse metastatic disease.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions
 appear to be relatively unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Diffuse osseous sclerotic metastatic disease is
 re- demonstrated throughout the thoracic spine.
