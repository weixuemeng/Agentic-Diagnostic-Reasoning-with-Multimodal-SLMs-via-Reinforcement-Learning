 pre-existing small to moderate pleural effusion has moderately increased in
 extent, causing increased atelectasis, notably in the retrocardiac lung
 regions.  There is no evidence of a left or right pneumothorax.  The very
 extensive bilateral pulmonary nodules are unchanged.  Unchanged evidence of
 osteosclerotic vertebral disease.  Unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
