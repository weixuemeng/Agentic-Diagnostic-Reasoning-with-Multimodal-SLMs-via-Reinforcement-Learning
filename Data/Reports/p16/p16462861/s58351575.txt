                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is likely stable, allowing for
 difference in patient positioning.  Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on
 the left than the right, appear slightly smaller, though this may also be due
 to positioning.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Again, the trachea is deviated rightward,
 due to prominent vessels, as previously identified on the prior CT.  The heart
 size remains moderately enlarged, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for differences in technique, there is likely very
 little change in the mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusion.  If any change is present, it is a slight decrease in the
 bilateral effusions.
