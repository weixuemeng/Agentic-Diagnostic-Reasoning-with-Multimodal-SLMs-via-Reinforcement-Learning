                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, observed aspiration, question new
 consolidation or effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is background COPD, with hyperinflation and
 flattened diaphragms.  There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and thickening of the minor fissure, without other
 evidence of CHF.  There is increased opacity at the left base consistent with
 a small effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is
 probably also some loculated pleural fluid and minimal opacity, ? atelectasis,
 at the right base.  Prominence of the paratracheal mediastinum is compatible
 with a combination of mediastinal fat, pleural fluid and lymph nodes seen on
 the ___ CT scan.
 
 Compared with ___, the CHF findings have improved. Opacities at the left
 and right bases has also improved slightly.  No new infiltrate is identified. 
 Known hiatal hernia and right rib fractures are not well appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: No new infiltrate identified.
