                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly and silhouette of the mediastinum are stable including calcified
 aortic arch.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations are
 noted.  They potentially might reflect pulmonary edema, but infectious process
 is another possibility.  Reassessment of the patient after dialysis is
 recommended.
 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
