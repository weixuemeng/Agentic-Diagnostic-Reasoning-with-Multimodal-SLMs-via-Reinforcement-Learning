                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips project over the left axilla.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is again
 mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity projects over the right mid
 lung, potentially an early focus of pneumonia, but not very striking.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the right mid lung, for which early pneumonia
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Atelectasis is also
 possible.  Short-term followup radiographs may be useful to evaluate further
 if clinically indicated.
