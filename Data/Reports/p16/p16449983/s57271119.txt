                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient admitted for sepsis likely from
 colitis, now with persistent hypoxia, ? volume overload versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination semi-upright
 sitting position.  AP frontal and left lateral views were obtained. 
 Comparison can be made with the next preceding portable chest examination of
 ___.  The previous portable chest examination suggested heart size
 at the upper limit of normal variation.  This finding is impossible to confirm
 as bilateral pleural densities conceal most of the cardiac silhouette.  There
 is now an increased pulmonary vascular pattern and in addition related to the
 high positioned diaphragm very crowded appearance of the pulmonary structures
 is observed.  Bilateral linear densities suggest atelectatic portions on the
 right base and mid lung field.  The lateral view discloses now bilateral
 pleural effusions accumulating in the posterior portions and blunting the
 dependent inferior pleural sinuses.  Extensive surgical metallic clips in the
 left axillary region appear unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified in the
 apical area.  The position of the previously described right internal jugular
 approach central venous line is unchanged, reaching the area of the upper
 right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: Deterioration of chest findings in the form of bilateral pleural
 effusions that have developed during the last four days.  Pulmonary vascular
 pattern is more congested.  The high-positioned diaphragms indicate poor
 inspirational performance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing pulmonary congestion with development of bilateral
 pleural effusion most likely related to CHF.  Non-distended azygos vein speaks
 against general fluid overload and favors assumption of left-sided CHF.
