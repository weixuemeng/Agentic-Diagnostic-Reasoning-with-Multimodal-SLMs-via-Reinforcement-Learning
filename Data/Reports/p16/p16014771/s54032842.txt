 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely relate to overlying soft tissue.  Bilateral, likely
 nipple shadows are seen.  No definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
