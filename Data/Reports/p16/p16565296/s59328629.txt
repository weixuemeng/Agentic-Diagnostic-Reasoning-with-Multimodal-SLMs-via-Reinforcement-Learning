                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is linear right basilar
 atelectasis/scarring.  Relative lucency of the upper lungs also suggests
 presence of pulmonary emphysema.  Skinfold is noted overlying the left upper
 hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with likely pulmonary emphysema.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  Please note that bronchoscopy or CT is more sensitive for
 pulmonary/endobronchial lesions.
