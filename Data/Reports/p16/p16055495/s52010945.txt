 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Since prior, there has been interval
 resolution of the left lung opacities.  The lungs are now grossly clear noting
 some persistent left basilar opacity laterally on the frontal view which could
 represent residual scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Deformity of the lateral right clavicle may be due to interval fracture.  ,
 the timing of which is uncertain.  Osseous structures are otherwise unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Small left basilar opacity seen on
 the frontal view could be due to atelectasis or scarring from prior infection.
 Probable, age indeterminant right lateral clavicular fracture which may be
