                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso performed at 8
 a.m., the same day.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with mild rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures due to right-sided volume loss. Opacity reflecting post-treatment
 changes is again seen within the paramediastinal region of the right upper
 lobe, without new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-treatment changes within the right upper lobe.  No
 radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
