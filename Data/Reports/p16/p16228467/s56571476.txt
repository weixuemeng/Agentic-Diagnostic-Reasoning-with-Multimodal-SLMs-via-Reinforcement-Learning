                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough, hypoxia.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___. 
 CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no significant
 change in right upper lobe post-radiation treatment fibrosis and traction
 bronchiectasis with mild elevation of the right hilum. The lungs are
 hyperinflated with bilateral upper lobe emphysema.  Ovoid opacity in the right
 upper lobe likely represents an area of fibrosis as seen on prior CT from
 ___.  The lungs are otherwise well expanded and clear and the
 pleural surfaces are normal without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 mediastinal shift is unchanged from ___ and is likely related to
 post-radiation scarring and fibrosis.  Heart size, mediastinal contour and
 hila are unchanged in configuration from ___. The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Chronic right suprahilar scarring, fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis is
 unchanged however can not exclude underlying subtle lesion which would be
 better assessed with CT. 
 3.  Right upper lobe ovoid opacity likely represents an area of scarring and
 is best assessed on ___ CT.
