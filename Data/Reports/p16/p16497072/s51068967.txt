                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with persistent pulmonary edema needing
 oxygen, assess fluid status.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 22:45.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:14 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is a persistent but improved interstitial bilateral abnormality,
 suggesting that superimposed interstitial edema has resolved.  When compared
 to more remote studies dating back to ___, the interstitial abnormality does
 appear to have been previously present and therefore could reflect progression
 of underlying interstitial fibrosis rather than an acute interstitial process.
 However, at the right medial lung base, there is more focal patchy opacity,
 which could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.  Therefore, clinical correlation
 is advised.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggest the
 presence of pleural thickening and/or small pleural effusions.
