                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and decreased right lung sounds, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there are increased
 focal airspace opacities in the right and left lung base greater on the right,
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 not excluded on this single frontal view.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Mediastinal contours are
 prominent, related in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta, but otherwise
 unchanged.  The trachea is deviated to the right by the aortic knob.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  A type 3 acromioclavicular
 dislocation is redemonstrated on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar focal airspace opacities increased from ___ on the
 right greater than the left, concerning for multifocal pneumonia, possibly
 aspiration pneumonia.
