                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of esophageal
 cancer, constrictive pericarditis, history of pleural effusion, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance, but there is
 redemonstration of the neoesophagus contour.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 most likely present, overall unchanged since the prior study, thus most likely
 representing pleural thickening and not pleural effusion.  Correlation with
 decubitus view is recommended.  Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  The
 surgical rib fracture of the right fifth rib is noted.
