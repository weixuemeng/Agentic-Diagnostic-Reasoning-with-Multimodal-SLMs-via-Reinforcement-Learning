 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, fever to 103  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The lungs appear hyperinflated
 and hyperlucent compatible with underlying emphysema. There is subtle opacity
 in the posterior lung base on the lateral projection which could represent a
 very early pneumonia. No additional consolidation. No large effusion or
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable in within normal
 limits. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema with new subtle opacity in the posterior lung base could represent a
 very early pneumonia.
