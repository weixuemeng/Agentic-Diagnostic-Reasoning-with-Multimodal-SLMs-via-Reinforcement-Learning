                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The descending
 aorta is moderately tortuous.  A prominent pericardial fat pad projects along
 the cardiac apex.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear aside from streaky right mid lung opacities suggesting minor
 atelectasis or minor fissural thickening.  There is mildly exaggerated
 kyphotic curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine and a mild anterior
 wedge compression deformity that appears chronic.  The mid-to-upper thoracic
 spine is mildly lordotic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
