                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of lung disease with desaturations.  Questionable fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing pleural
 effusions have minimally decreased in extent.  However, bilateral, right more
 than left subtle reticular opacities are seen on both the frontal and the
 lateral radiograph.  Given the small overall lung volumes the findings are
 suggestive of a fibrotic process.  CT could be performed to clarify this
 suspicion.  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of acute pulmonary edema. 
 Status post CABG.
