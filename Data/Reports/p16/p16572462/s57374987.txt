 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia, SOB, hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips again noted.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears progressed from
 prior exam.  There is hilar congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Scattered left-sided calcified pleural plaque is noted.  There is suture
 material along the right mid to lower lung reflecting prior wedge resection. 
 No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  Extensive vascular
 calcification in the upper abdomen corresponds with known ectatic calcified
 thoracic aorta.

 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Calcified
 pleural plaque likely reflects prior asbestos disease.
