 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:59 PM
  Right-sided chronic diaphragmatic herniation is again noted with new increased
  opacity at the right lower lobe. These findings are likely suggestive of a
  small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis but pneumonia must be
  excluded in the proper clinical setting. Small left pleural effusion and
  adjacent atelectasis persists. Mildly increased central venous pressure again
  noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Severe dyspnea on exertion and systolic CHF with dull right
 base.
 
 Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including ___ and
 ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable. 
 
 Mild vascular congestion is stable.  There is increased opacity in the right
 lower lobe consistent with worsening atelectasis.  Superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Patient has known
 chronic right-sided diaphragmatic herniation.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
 
 Sternal wires are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative
 changes are in the thoracic spine.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased.
