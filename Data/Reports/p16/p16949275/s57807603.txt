                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post CABG with 10 days of
 progressive dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Opacity at
 the left base is probably atelectasis and scarring, less likely infection. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, similar to ___, compatible with
 pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
 enlargement and mediastinal silhouette are stable.  Median sternotomy wires
 are intact.  Right hemidiaphragmatic elevation is unchanged.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic sulcus is unchanged from ___, likely due to scarring. 
 Degenerative change is seen in the shoulder girdles bilaterally, incompletely
 evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild congestive heart failure without overt pulmonary edema.
 2.  Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis and scarring, less likely
 infection.
