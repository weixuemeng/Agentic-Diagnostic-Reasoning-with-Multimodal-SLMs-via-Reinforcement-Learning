                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rib pain  // rib fractures?
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal
 hilar and mediastinal structures.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  On the current radiograph, there is no evidence for the
 presence of rib fractures. However, if clinical complaints persist, dedicated
 rib series should be performed, because of the increased sensitivity in the
 detection of rib fractures.
