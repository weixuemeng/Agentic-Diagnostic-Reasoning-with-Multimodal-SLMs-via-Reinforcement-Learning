                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Previously identified right-sided PICC line is no longer
 seen.  Bilateral left greater than right small pleural effusions persist, not
 significantly changed.  Associated left base opacity may represent adjacent
 atelectasis, although a component of infection is not completely excluded. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear without evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Dense atherosclerotic
 calcifications again seen at the arch.  Severe mid thoracic wedge deformity in
 the thoracic spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left greater than right pleural effusions when
 compared to previous exam from ___.  Associated left basilar opacity
 could represent adjacent atelectasis/scar, although infection is not
 completely excluded and clinical correlation suggested.
