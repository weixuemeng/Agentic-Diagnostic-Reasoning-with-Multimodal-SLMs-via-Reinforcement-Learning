                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncope.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is subtle increased opacity at the left lung
 base laterally.  This could be due to atelectasis; however, developing
 infiltrate is also possible.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits,
 noting a mildly tortuous aorta.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, potentially due to atelectasis; however,
 early infiltrate is not excluded.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
