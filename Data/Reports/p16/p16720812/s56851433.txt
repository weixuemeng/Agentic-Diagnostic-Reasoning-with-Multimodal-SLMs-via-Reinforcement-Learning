                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ Chest radiograph, ___ Chest CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged with a
 left ventricular predominance.  The cardiac silhouette size appears minimally
 increased when compared to prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are relatively unchanged, with calcification of the aorta redemonstrated.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion, increased from the prior study, and mild patchy opacity in the left
 lung base, which could reflect atelectasis, though infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.  Subsegmental atelectasis is also likely present within the
 right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion increased when compared to the prior
 exams from ___ with  minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base which may
 reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base as well.
