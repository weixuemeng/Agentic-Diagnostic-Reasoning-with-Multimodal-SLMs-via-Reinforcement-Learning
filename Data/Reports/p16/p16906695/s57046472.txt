                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:07.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided chest tube is noted with tip terminating near the left apex. 
 Known pneumothorax within the left lung likely persists given the lucency
 within the left lung base, but difficulty to quantify.  There is a large
 amount o subcutaneous emphysema within the left lateral chest wall, increased
 compared to the previous exam.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects a
 combination of contusion and atelectasis.  Known left-sided hemorrhagic
 pleural effusion is not clearly delineated.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures
 are again noted.  There is excreted contrast within the collecting systems
 bilaterally from recent CT exam.
