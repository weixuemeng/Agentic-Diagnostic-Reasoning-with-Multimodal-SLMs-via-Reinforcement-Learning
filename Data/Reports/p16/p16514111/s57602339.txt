                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Poor inspiratory effort on last chest radiograph, suboptimal study,
 with difficulty speaking and walking.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:01.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are improved compared to the prior study.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Previously noted patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 have improved, with only minimal residual atelectatic changes seen.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  ___ fiducial markers
 are again seen within the liver.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in inspiratory effort within near-complete resolution of
 the previously seen bibasilar airspace opacities compatible with atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation.
