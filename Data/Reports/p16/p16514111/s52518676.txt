                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Difficulty walking, facial sensation changes, difficulty speaking.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This causes accentuation of the cardiac silhouette size
 which is likely within normal limits.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  Crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes, but infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  ___ fudicial seeds are seen within the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen, within the liver.  Emphysematous changes
 are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. 
 Repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory effort is suggested for improved
 assessment of the lung bases.
