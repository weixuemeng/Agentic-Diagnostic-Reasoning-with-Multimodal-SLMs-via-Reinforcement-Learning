                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a nodular density projecting over the left mid lung which
 suggests a nipple shadow.  Lung fields appear otherwise clear, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiothoracic process.  Probably nipple shadow
 projecting over the left mid lung; when clinically appropriate, confirmation
 with an additional PA view using nipple markers is recommended.
