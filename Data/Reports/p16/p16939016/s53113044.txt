                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for drainage of
 effusion/pneumothorax/CT position s/p chest tube placement      eval for
 drainage of effusion/pneumothorax/CT position s/p chest tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is an placement of
 a right chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.  The areas of
 opacification at the bases consistent with layering pleural effusions are more
 prominent.  Is unclear whether this could merely reflect a less erect position
 of the patient.  Monitoring and support devices are otherwise unchanged.
