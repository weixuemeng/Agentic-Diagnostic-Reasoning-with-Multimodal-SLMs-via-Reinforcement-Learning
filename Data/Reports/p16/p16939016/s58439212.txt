                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cabg with unstable hct  // eval for
 hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___ at 08:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained approximately 8 hours prior, a
 small, right pleural effusion is now evident.  Small, left pleural effusion
 and adjacent atelectasis are unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged,
 but mediastinal widening and pulmonary vascular congestion are improved. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  A right-sided IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium via.  A left-sided IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in mid SVC.  An ET tube tip terminates 3 cm
 above the carina.  An enteric tube passes subdiaphragmatically, but terminates
 outside the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly appreciated small right pleural effusion and unchanged small left
 pleural effusion may be compatible with a hemothorax.  Mediastinal widening
 and pulmonary edema otherwise improved.
