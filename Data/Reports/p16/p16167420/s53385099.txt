                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect chest view was reviewed in comparison
 with prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  No lung opacities of
 concern.  Top normal heart size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Moderate atherosclerotic calcification in aortic arch is present. 
 A skinfold in the right upper lateral lung should not be confused for
 pneumothorax.  Focal dense calcification in the left lateral aspect of upper
 neck is probably within the carotid artery.
