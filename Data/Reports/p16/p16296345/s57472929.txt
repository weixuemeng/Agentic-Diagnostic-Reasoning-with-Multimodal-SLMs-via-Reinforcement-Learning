  1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
  2. Mildly displaced right anterior sixth rib fracture and possible additional
  right anterior seventh rib fracture.
  3. Low lung volumes and positioning limit assessment.  The lungs are grossly
  clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubated transfer, evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view.  Low lung
 volumes and rightward rotation somewhat limit evaluation.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes.  There is a mildly
 displaced fracture of the right anterior sixth rib.  Mild contour irregularity
 of the seventh rib may represent an additional fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mildly displaced right anterior sixth rib fracture and possible additional
 right anterior seventh rib fracture.
 3. Low lung volumes and positioning limit assessment.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.
