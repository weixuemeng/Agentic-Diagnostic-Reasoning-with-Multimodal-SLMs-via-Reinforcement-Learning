                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronch, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  Compared with ___, the patchy opacity in the
 right upper zone is slightly more confluent.  There is minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and atelectasis at the left base, unchanged.  Dense
 vascular calcification is noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax detected.  Slight increase in degree of
 confluence of the right upper zone opacity, could reflect mild post-procedure
 edema and/or hemorrhage.
