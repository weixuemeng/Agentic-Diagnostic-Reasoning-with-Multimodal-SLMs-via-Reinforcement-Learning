                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia from outside hospital.  Assess
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___ at 3:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal views of the chest were obtained.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged with stable cardiomediastinal contours.  Patchy
 opacity of the right upper lung is similar to multiple prior exams, and
 compatible with pneumonia on the prior CT.  New left retrocardiac opacity may
 represent a new focus of infection.  Two calcified nodules are again seen in
 the right lung.  No pneumothorax.  Dense vascular calcifications are present. 
 No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right upper lobe opacity, compatible with pneumonia. 
 New left base opacity may represent a new focus of infection or asymmetric
 edema  Follow-up imaging after therapy is recommended to exclude an underlying
 mass.
