 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:20 PM
  Right upper lobe opacity, concerning for residual or recurrent pneumonia.
  Density at the left costophrenic angle most likely represents an epicardial
  fat pad, less likely pleural effusion. Low lung volumes with left lower lung
  opacity, which most likely represents atelectasis. Right PICC tip projects at
  level of mid-low superior vena cava. Extensive vascular calcifications seen.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:20 p.m. on ___ at time of
  initial review of the study.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, outside hospital admission, PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is extensive predominantly axillary vascular calcification. 
 Probably known recent parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe, consistent
 with previous pneumonia or a history of TB.  Atelectatic opacities in the
 retrocardiac lung areas.  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Several calcified granulomas are seen at the right lung bases.
 
 Right PICC line, the line has a normal course, the tip of the line projects
 over the mid-to-low SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
