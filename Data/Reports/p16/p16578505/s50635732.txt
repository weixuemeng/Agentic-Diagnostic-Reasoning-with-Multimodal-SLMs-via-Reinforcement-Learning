                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable upright frontal image of the chest.  
 
 There has been interval increase in the opacity of the right lung base, which
 could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is slightly more prominent than on prior exam and
 there are increased interstitial markings, consistent with mild pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right lung base opacity, which may represent atelectasis but
 would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
 
 
 2.  Increased mild pulmonary edema.
