                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, who received intravenous fluids.  Please
 evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Again seen is diffusely increased interstitial
 markings of the lungs, particularly at the bilateral bases, which are
 consistent with patient's chronic interstitial lung disease.  Bullous disease
 is again noted at the left lung apex, not significantly changed from the prior
 studies and related to patient's emphysema.  There appears to be a new
 consolidation at the left lower lobe compared to the prior exam.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is no large pleural effusion.  Note is made
 of bibasilar atelectasis.  Loss of the right heart border is due to the
 patient's pectus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New focal consolidation at the left lower lobe compared to the prior study. 
 This could be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
