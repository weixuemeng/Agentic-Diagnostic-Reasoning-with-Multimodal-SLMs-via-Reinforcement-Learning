                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pressure and hemoptysis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to chest CT
 from ___ and chest xray from ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Relative paucity of vascular markings at the
 left lung apex is compatible with extensive emphysematous change identified on
 prior CT from ___.  Increased interstitial markings are seen in the
 mid lungs and the left base are unchanged from prior and potentially due to
 chronic changes.  There is no new confluent consolidation.  Enlarged pulmonary
 hila and cardiac silhouette are again seen but stable.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic lung changes
 without definite consolidation.
