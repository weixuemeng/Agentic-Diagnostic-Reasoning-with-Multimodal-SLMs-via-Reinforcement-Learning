                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with productive cough and dyspnea.  Question
 pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous plain
 film and CT from ___.  There are diffusely increased interstitial
 markings seen in the lungs bilaterally compatible with chronic lung disease. 
 Increased lucency at the left lung apex and abutting the mediastinum is
 compatible with emphysematous changes identified on prior CT.  There is no
 definite new region of consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of chronic lung disease without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process noting that evaluation for a subtle infiltrate is
 limited given background changes.
