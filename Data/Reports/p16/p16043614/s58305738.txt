 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:18 PM
  Lung volumes remain low.  Linear opacities in both lungs are unchanged,
  probably scarring.  Opacities previously seen obscuring the left posterior
  costophrenic sulcus have improved, albeit, persist.  Pneumonia would still
  have to be considered in this clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes with dense streaks of atelectasis or scarring at both bases.  There
 again is some retrocardiac opacification with mild obscuration of the
 posterior aspect of the left hemidiaphragm.  Although this most likely
 represents atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
