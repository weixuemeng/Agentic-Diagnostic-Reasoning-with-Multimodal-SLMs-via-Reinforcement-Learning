                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This causes accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette which is likely at least borderline enlarged. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Assessment of the lung bases is limited due to the presence of low
 lung volumes, but there is at least bibasilar atelectasis.  Chronic scarring
 within the right middle lobe is re- demonstrated.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Osseous fragmentation of the
 distal right clavicle is compatible with remote trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis and scarring, although infection is difficult to exclude. 
 Consider repeat PA and lateral radiographs with improved inspiratory effort
 for better assessment of the lung bases.
