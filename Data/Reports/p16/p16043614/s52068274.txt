                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of worsening fevers.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low which causes accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette which is at least borderline enlarged.  There is
 again crowding of the bronchovascular structures without definite evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Assessment of the lung bases is limited due to presence of
 low lung volumes but there is at least bibasilar atelectasis.  A band-like
 linear density overlying the right lower lung is likely secondary to
 atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Osseous fragmentation of
 the distal right clavicle is compatible with remote trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Bibasilar consolidations as well as low lung volumes resulting in crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures; most likely due to atelectasis, however
 pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
