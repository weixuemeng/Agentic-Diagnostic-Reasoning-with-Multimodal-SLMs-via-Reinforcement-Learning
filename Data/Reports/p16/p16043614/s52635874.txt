                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Linear opacities across the right upper lung and the left mid lung represent
 subsegmental atelectasis versus scarring and are unchanged from since at least
 ___ .  Of note, in the lateral view there is a suggestion of opacity
 which obscures the left costophrenic angle and was not present in prior
 radiographs. This opacity cannot be properly assessed in the frontal view due
 to low lung volumes. No other focal opacities are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable although
 assessment is limited due to low lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suggestion of opacity in the lateral view obscuring the left
 costophrenic angle. Left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excldued with this
 appearance.
