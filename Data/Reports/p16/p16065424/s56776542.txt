                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with indwelling
 ICD pacer leads unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal considering low
 lung volumes.  Homogeneous opacity persists adjacent to lower left heart
 border, with blunting of left costophrenic sulcus.  Correlative CT of ___ shows this is due to a prominent pericardial fat pad and not a pleural
 effusion.  Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
