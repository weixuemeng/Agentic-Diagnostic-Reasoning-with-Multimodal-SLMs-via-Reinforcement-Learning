                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sickle cell disease and chest pain. 
 Evaluate for acute chest syndrome.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___ and multiple chest
 radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were taken.  Mild
 cardiomegaly and left basilar atelectasis/scarring are unchanged finding. 
 There is minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank interstitial
 edema.  There is a faint opacity projecting over the right hemidiaphragm. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The location of colon
 immediately beneath the left hemidiaphragm suggests asplenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Baseline cardiac size with minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no
 frank interstitial edema.
 2. Faint opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis or early
 consolidation.
