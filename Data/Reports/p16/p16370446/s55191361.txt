                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier
 today.  Also with a history of COPD and increased sputum production.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a widespread interstitial abnormality, potentially
 chronic, although no prior studies are available.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Patchy mid-to-upper
 lung atelectasis/scarring is noted bilaterally.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  Note is made of a calcified lymph node
 in the aortopulmonary window.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Widespread but mild interstitial abnormality, uncertain chronicity,
 possibly mild vascular congestion, although potential more chronic; in
 addition to patchy opacities suggesting scarring or atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, likely due to prior granulomatous
 exposure.
