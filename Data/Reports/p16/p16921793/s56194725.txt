                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and intermittent
 choking.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Previously seen consolidation within
 the right lung base appears less dense compared to recent prior examination. 
 However, there is increased right pleural fluid and probable underlying
 atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Sclerosis of the
 superior and inferior endplates of the thoracic vertebral bodies is consistent
 with renal osteodystrophy, unchanged from prior.  Multiple compression
 fractures are again noted and are better characterized on prior CT.  No
 definite acute fracture is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right pleural effusion with less conspicuous
 appearance of prior right medial lung opacity.  No other significant change
 compared to prior examinations.
