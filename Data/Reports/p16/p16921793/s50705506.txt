                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Extensive coronary calcifications are
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Assessment of the
 lung parenchyma re-demonstrates diffuse interstitial changes but no focal
 consolidation to suggest interval development of infectious process has been
 demonstrated.  Substantial hyperinflation is noted given the increased AP
 diameter in part due to most likely present kyphosis and multiple mid thoracic
 wedge fractures.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
