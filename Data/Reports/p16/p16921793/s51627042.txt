                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease, due for dialysis today, now
 with orthopnea, here to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged but stable.  Extensive
 coronary calcifications are best appreciated on the lateral radiograph.  The
 mediastinal contours are prominent due to an unfolded and tortuous thoracic
 aorta.  Calcification at the aortic knob is noted.  The trachea is slightly
 deviated to the right by the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 congested with minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Note is again made of exaggerated thoracic kyphosis
 with multiple wedge compression deformities at the mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.
