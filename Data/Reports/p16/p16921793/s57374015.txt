                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, shortness
 of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and coronary arterial
 calcifications are again seen.
 The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Prominence of the hila
 bilaterally is compatible with known pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Lungs are hyperinflated. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Degenerative
 changes of both glenohumeral joints are re- again noted.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is present with a rugger jerset
 appearance compatible with renal osteodystrophy.  IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
