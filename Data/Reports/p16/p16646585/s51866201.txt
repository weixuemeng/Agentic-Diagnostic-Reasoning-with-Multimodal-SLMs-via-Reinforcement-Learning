                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease, on
 hemodialysis with calciphylaxis, infectious workup for increasing white blood
 count.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single view AP chest view has been obtained with the patient in
 semi-upright position.  There is considerable cardiac enlargement, although
 this may be exaggerated by the portable technique.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta of ordinary ___ but calcium
 deposits are present in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature shows a mild degree of perivascular haze, but there is no evidence
 of interstitial alveolar edema.  Large soft tissue structures are overlying
 the lung bases, but no gross pulmonary abnormalities can be identified and the
 lateral pleural sinuses appear free.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION: No conclusive evidence for pneumonic infiltrate on portable single
 view chest examination.  Review of the most recent abdominal CT has been
 performed and the lung bases are inspected.  There were bilateral atelectasis
 and some pleural densities , probably scar formations but no acute pneumonic
 infiltrate was present on ___.
