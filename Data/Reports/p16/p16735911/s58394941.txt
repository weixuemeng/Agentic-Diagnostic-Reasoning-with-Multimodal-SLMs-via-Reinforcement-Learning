                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 following thoracentesis.  The overall radiographic appearance most likely
 reflects diffuse pneumonia with possible ARDS.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
