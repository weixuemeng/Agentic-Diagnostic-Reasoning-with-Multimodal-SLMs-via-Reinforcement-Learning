                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV, history of necrotizing pneumonia, elevated white blood cell
 count and positive D-glucan, concern for fungal colonization or necrotic
 lesions, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.  Compared to most recent study,
 there is a decrease in bilateral diffuse opacities.  There are still several
 patchy heterogeneous opacities predominantly in the lower lobes likely
 representing multifocal pneumonia.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Left PICC line ends in the right atrium.  An NG tube has been
 removed.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decrease in bilateral diffuse opacities likely from a combination of
 decreasing pulmonary edema and extent of pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged.
 
 2.  The PICC line ends in the right atrium.  Suggest pulling back 4-5 cm.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:00pm on ___ by
 telephone.
