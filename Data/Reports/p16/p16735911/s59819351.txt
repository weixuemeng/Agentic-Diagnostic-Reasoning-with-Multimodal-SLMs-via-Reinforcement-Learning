                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior chest radiographs through ___ with most recent from
 ___.  Concurrently, a chest CT from ___ was
 reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral, heterogeneous opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, continue
 to persist. Given low lung volumes and long standing opacities, it likely
 represents an organizing fibrosing stage or ARDS.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persisting, multifocal, heterogeneous lung consolidations with
 low lung volumes likely represent an organizing fibrosing stage or ARDS.
