                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with HIV and new fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest and chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:
 
 The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  There are
 increased diffuse parenchymal opacities, which given the rapid progression
 from one day prior, likely reflect an element of pulmonary edema superimposed
 upon known multifocal pneumonia, which was better evaluated by recent CT. 
 Effusions and area of cavitation necrosis medially at the right lung base are
 not apparent radiographically.  There is no pneumothorax.
