                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with recent necrotizing pneumonia and
 ARDS, now extubated with new elevated white count, question new pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___ hours
 ___ ___ at 2:00 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film of ___ at ___ hours is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation.  Left subclavian PICC line has its tip near the
 cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube remains in place with the tip within the
 stomach.  
 
 2. Stable bilateral diffuse airspace process which makes it challenging to
 detect any subtle interval changes.  Relatively lower lung volumes when
 compared to several multiple previous prior studies.  Diffuse airspace process
 is probably not significantly changed given the interval reduction in lung
 volumes.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
