                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with decline in mental status, report of confusion, evaluate
 for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases medially is suggestive of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation identified.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Mild unfolding of the aorta is similar to the prior study. 
 Increased lung volumes on the lateral view radiograph compared with the prior
 study are associated with improved aeration in the lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, doubt acute pulmonary process.
