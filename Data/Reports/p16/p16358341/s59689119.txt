                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known rib fractures and worsening pain.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Again seen are multiple right lateral rib fractures with mild pleural
 thickening, not significantly changed from ___.  Known old left rib
 fractures are not well visualized radiographically. Deformity of the manubrium
 is consistent with the fracture identified on the ___ chest CT. There is
 minimal degenerative spurring along the t-spine. Review of ___ chest CT
 raises the question of minimal concavity along superior endplate of an upper
 thoracic vertebral body, ? T3 (s602b:im ___), of indeterminate acuity, without
 frank loss of vertebral body height. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The lungs are well expanded, except for possible trace atelectasis at the
 right lung base. No chf, focal infiltrate or gross pleural effusion is
 identified. Minimal blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle could
 reflect a small right effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Right lateral rib fractures are re-identified, with associated stable mild
 pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 2) Known manubrial fracture appears grossly unchanged. 
 
 3) Possible minimal superior endplate deformity of an upper thoracic vertebral
 body, of indeterminate acuity. Please see comment above.
 
 4) Stable mild cardiomegaly.
