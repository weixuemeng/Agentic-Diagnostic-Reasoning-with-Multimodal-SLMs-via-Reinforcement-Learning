                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of aspiration.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is significantly enlarged.  A retrocardiac opacity
 likely relates to a combination of pleural effusion and volume loss, as seen
 on prior chest CT examination.  Increased opacity at the right lung base is
 also likely due to a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  However,
 an underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral shoulder prostheses are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities are likely a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, however an underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
