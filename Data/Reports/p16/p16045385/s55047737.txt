                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, recent bowel perforation, acutely hypotensive.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are
 decreased accentuating the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina.  There is a new right IJ central
 venous catheter with its tip terminating in the distal SVC. The heart is
 enlarged. There is collapse of the left lower lobe.  Bilateral opacities
 likely reflect a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  No evidence of
 free air in this frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina.  
 
 2.  Left lower lung collapse. Persistent bibasilar opacities likely reflect a
 combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  An underlying infectious
 process however cannot be excluded.  
 
 3.  No definite evidence of free air in this single frontal chest radiograph. 
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by ___ via telephone
 on ___ at 02:26, time of discovery.
