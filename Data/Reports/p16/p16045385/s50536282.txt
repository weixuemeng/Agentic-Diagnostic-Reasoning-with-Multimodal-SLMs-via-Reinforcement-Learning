                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biliary sepsis, status post extubation.  Evaluate interval change in
 left lower lobe collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows a new right PICC with the tip
 terminating in the right atrium.  For more appropriate positioning, this
 should be retracted by approximately 5 cm.  Compared to the prior study, there
 has been interval improvement in aeration of the bases bilaterally with slight
 improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis persists. 
 The apices are clear.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is worse indicative of
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Enlarged cardiac contour is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. New right PICC with the tip in the right atrium, should be retracted by 5
 cm for more appropriate positioning.  
 
 2. Interval improvement in aeration of both lungs with continued bibasilar
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
 
 3. Worsening vascular congestion and modreate pulmonary edema.
