                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ETOH and vomiting.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes are noted at
 the current exam.  There are streaky bibasilar opacities, left greater than
 right.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits for technique and low inspiratory effort.  Degenerative
 changes seen at the shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities.  While these
 may be due to atelectasis, the possibility of aspiration is certainly
 possible.  Consider PA and lateral views for further clarification.
