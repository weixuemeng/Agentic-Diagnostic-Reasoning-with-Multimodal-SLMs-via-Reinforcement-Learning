                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal except for prominent pulmonary
 arteries might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension given the presence of
 hyperinflated lungs and most likely represent emphysema or small airway
 disease.  Bibasilar linear opacities most likely reflect atelectasis,
 unchanged since the prior study.  No new consolidations to suggest infectious
 process demonstrated.
