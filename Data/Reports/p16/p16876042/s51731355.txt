                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and acute renal failure.
 Diffuse weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Linear right
 basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis.  There is a nodular density
 projecting over the left lung apex.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflation without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Streaky right
 basilar opacities could be due to atelectasis.  Left apical nodular opacity
 could the within overlying osseous structures but this could be further
 assessed by a repeat exam with apical lordodic view.
