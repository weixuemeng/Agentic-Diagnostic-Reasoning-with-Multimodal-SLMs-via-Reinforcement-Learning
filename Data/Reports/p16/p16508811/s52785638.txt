                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal pneumonia, acute renal failure,
 new O2 requirement after fluid resuscitation.  // Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 or worsening infection     Evaluate for pulmonary edema or worsening infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive moderate pulmonary edema, best appreciated in the perihilar left
 lung, is accompanied by increased vascular caliber in the upper lobes and new
 small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar consolidation has also increased, due
 either to worsening pneumonia or edema deposited in the pneumonia. The
 possibility that this consolidation is due to dependent edema alone should not
 be discarded. Heart size top-normal unchanged. No pneumothorax.
