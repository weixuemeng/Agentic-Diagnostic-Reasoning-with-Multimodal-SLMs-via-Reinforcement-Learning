 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of renal transplant and chronic heart failure, fever, and
 cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacity in
 the right lung apex has completely resolved.  However, opacities at both lung
 bases are still present.  The opacities appear less dense than on the previous
 image.  Currently, no evidence of pulmonary edema is present.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusions on the frontal and lateral images.
