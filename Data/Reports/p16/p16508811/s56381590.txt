                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided double lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 proximal right atrium.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Aeration of the lungs has markedly improved compared to the previous
 radiograph, with patchy opacities demonstrated in the lung bases, potentially
 infectious or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis however infection
 is not excluded.
