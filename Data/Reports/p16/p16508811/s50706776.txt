 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with DOE  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large-bore right-sided central venous catheter is stable in position,
 terminating and the proximal right atrium.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Bibasilar opacities are felt to more likely relate to vascular congestion
 rather than consolidation, however in the appropriate clinical setting,
 underlying pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacities are felt to more
