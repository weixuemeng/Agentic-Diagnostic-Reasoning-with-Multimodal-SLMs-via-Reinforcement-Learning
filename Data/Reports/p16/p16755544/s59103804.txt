                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Severe epigastric pain in the setting of alcohol abuse.  Question
 free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a streaky linear opacity projecting
 over the left mid lung, probably within the lingula and suggestive of minor
 atelectasis or scarring.  Minimal subpleural thickening at each lung apex is
 also symmetric and suggestive of minor scarring.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No free air is identified.  Moderate degenerative changes
 are noted along the mid thoracic spine with small-to-moderate anterior
 osteophytes.  Moderate degenerative changes involve the right
 acromioclavicular joint.  Slight rightward convex curvature is centered along
 the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or free air.
