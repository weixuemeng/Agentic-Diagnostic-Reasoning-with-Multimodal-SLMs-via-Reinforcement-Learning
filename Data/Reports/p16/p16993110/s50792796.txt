                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent multifocal pna  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There appear to be small bilateral pleural effusions.  Left base opacity may
 be due to combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion or could be due to
 consolidation, which appears increased as compared to the prior study.  Left
 mid lung opacity may be slightly improved although there appears to be
 increased opacity at the left lung base.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Left
 base opacity appears increased as compared the prior study and could be due to
 worsening consolidation, atelectasis, or combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.
 
 While left mid lung opacity may be slightly improved compared the prior study,
 there appears to be increased opacity in the right perihilar/ right mid lung
 which could be due to worsening infection or vascular congestion.  Consider
 dedicated PA and lateral views for further assessment.
