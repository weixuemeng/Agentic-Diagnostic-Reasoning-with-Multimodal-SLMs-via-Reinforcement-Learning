                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hemoptysis.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Bilateral effusions are small.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  The hila are enlarged bilaterally likely due to enlarged pulmonary
 arteries.  I cannot exclude the presence of lymphadenopathy on the right. 
 Opacities in the right middle lobe could be due to atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Given the clinical history of hemoptysis and abnormalities in the hila and
 right middle lobe, CT is recommended for further evaluation.
