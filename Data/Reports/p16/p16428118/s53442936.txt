                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and respiratory compromise.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac contours are not well delineated, but the heart is
 probably mild to moderately enlarged.  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky
 right basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  There is more extensive but
 vague left lower lung opacity; a pleural effusion is suspected on the left but
 not well demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates below the thoracic inlet about 6 cm above the carina, and an
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  If clinically indicated, the tube
 could be advanced 2 cm for more optimal positioning.  Orogastric tube coursing
 into the stomach.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Substantial left basilar opacification, which could be seen with
 atelectasis and possibly pleural effusion, but pneumonia is not excluded by
 this study.
