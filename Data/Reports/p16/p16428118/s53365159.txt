                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 improvement in the extent of pulmonary edema compared to yesterday.  There is
 right lower lobe collapse and extensive atelectasis of the left lower lobe,
 both of which have progressed.   The left costophrenic angle now appears
 sharper, indicating interval clearance of the pleural effusion.  There is
 likely persistent small right pleural effusion.  The upper lung fields are
 clear.  Slight widening of the upper mediastinum is consistent with vascular
 engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The new right internal jugular central venous catheter along with the
 pre-existing right internal jugular catheter terminates appropriately in the
 lower SVC.  An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.5 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in the severity of congestive heart failure evidenced
 by improvement in pulmonary edema and resorption of left pleural effusion.
 2.  Low lung volumes with marked bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, raising
 concern for hypoventilation.
