                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man status post kidney transplant with new onset
 shortness of breath, possible fluid overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  IJ catheter tip is unchanged. Worsening pulmonary vascular
 congestion likely reflecting volume overload.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 notable for interval bulging of the left pulmonary outflow tract reflecting
 pulmonary arterial dilatation.  This can be due to extensive vascular
 congestion and volume overload or perhaps embolic phenomena leading to acute
 increase in pulmonary pressures which needs to be correlated clinically. 
 Heart size is top normal.  No significant pleural effusions and no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Increased pulmonary vascular congestion with prominence of the left pulmonary
 outflow tract.
 
 NOTE:  Dr. ___ was contacted by Dr. ___ at 11:20 a.m. on ___ and the above results were discussed.
