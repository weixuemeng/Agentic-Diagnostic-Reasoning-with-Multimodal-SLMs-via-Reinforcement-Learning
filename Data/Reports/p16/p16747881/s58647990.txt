                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiac arrest, intubated, CVL line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 2.9 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line is in mid SVC.  The
 distal end of the NG tube cannot be assessed.  There is some mild gastric
 distention.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is new in this patient with
 prior sternotomy and severe cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position; however, NG tube tip is not
 confidently visualized.  Considering the mild gastric distention, if needed,
 dedicated abdominal study can be done to evaluate the location of the tip.
 2.  New mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
