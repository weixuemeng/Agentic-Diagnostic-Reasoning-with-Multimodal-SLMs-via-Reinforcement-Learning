                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Arrest, for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some degree of vascular congestion
 and mild atelectatic changes at the bases.  No definite acute focal pneumonia,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting, retrocardiac opacification could
 not be definitely excluded.
