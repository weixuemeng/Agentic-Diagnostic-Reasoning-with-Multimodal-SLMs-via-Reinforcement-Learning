 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:50 PM
  ET tube at thoracic inlet 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip below the
  diaphragm within the stomach.  Left mid lung opacity compatible with
  pneumonia.  Increased right lower lobe opacification and persistent
  retrocardiac opacification from the most recent prior study of 08:50 may
  represent worsening atelectasis or multifocal infectious process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, tachypnea, fever, left upper lobe opacity,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase
 in extent and severity of the pre-existing bilateral, right basal and left
 perihilar parenchymal opacity.  The morphology and location of the opacities
 suggest a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 The monitoring and support devices are constant.
