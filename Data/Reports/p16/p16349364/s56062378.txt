                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, the lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 emphysema.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated with persistent pleural
 thickening or effusion.  This is not significantly changed.  Surgical chain
 sutures are noted in the right base.  This is consistent with a prior partial
 resection.  Mediastinal clips are present with stable distortion of the right
 hilus.  There is no focal air space opacity.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 left pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Apical thickening and scarring is
 unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Stable post-surgical changes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and
 pleural thickening at the right base.
 3.  Stable chronic changes of COPD.
