  1.  Several rounded, scattered densities projecting over the right lung and
  subpleural asymmetry at the right lung apex are incompletely characterized and
  if clinically indicated a CT is recommended for further characterization.
  2.  The peripherally calcified soft tissue lesion at the right costophrenic
  angle is unchanged grossly from ___.
  3.  No evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac leads are contiguous with a generator projecting over the left chest. 
 The calcified soft tissue mass at the right costophrenic angle is grossly
 unchanged from ___.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Nodular pleural
 thickening at the right apex could be a mass.  A rounded density projecting
 over the medial right may lie outside of the lung fields.  Additional tiny
 rounded densities projecting over the right midlung are incompletely
 characterized on this single view.  There is no pneumothorax.  Possible small
 right pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Several rounded, scattered densities projecting over the right lung and
 pleural nodule at the right lung apex are incompletely characterized and if
 clinically indicated a CT is recommended for further characterization.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema.
 2.  The peripherally calcified soft tissue lesion at the right costophrenic
 angle is unchanged grossly from ___.
 3.  No evidence of pneumonia.
