                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, bibasilar crackles.  //
 Eval for pulmonary edema vs other process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral pleural calcifications/plaques are re- demonstrated suggesting prior
 asbestos exposure.  Persistent inferolateral right pleural thickening is seen.
 Left base opacities which are new since the prior study from ___
 could in part relate to new pleural thickening however, underlying infection
 or aspiration may be present.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, new since the prior study which may be due to a trace pleural effusion
 versus pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive bilateral pleural plaques raise concern for prior asbestos exposure.
 Persistent inferolateral right pleural thickening.
 
 Left base opacity new since ___ may represent new pleural
 thickening/progression of post asbestos exposure changes, underlying infection
 or aspiration not excluded.
