                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:54 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with VATS right upper lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to postoperative chest radiographs on ___:
 
 The postoperative volume of the right hemithorax remains moderately small, and
 there is still an abnormal contour to the apparent right upper mediastinum.  I
 am concerned that this could be collapse of the right upper lobe, which should
 be considered in the clinical context.  The left lung and the postoperative
 right lower lobe are clear.  The heart is normal size.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 12:00 noon when these findings were recognized.
