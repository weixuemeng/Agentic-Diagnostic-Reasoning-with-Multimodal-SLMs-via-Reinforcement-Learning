                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic lung versus prostate cancer with weakness
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Central venous line tip terminates at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  Minimal bibasal areas of atelectasis are present. 
 No evidence of focal consolidation to definitely diagnose pneumonia is seen,
 but left lower lobe opacity can potentially represent resolving or developing
 infection.  Given the patient's history, followup of the patient four weeks
 after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended.   The nodular opacity
 in the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe is only partially seen on the
 current study.
