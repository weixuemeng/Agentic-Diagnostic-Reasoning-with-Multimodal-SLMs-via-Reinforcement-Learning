                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with postoperative fever.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  Thicker
 linear opacities in both lung bases are probably worsening atelectasis, but
 could obscure early pneumonia.  A small pleural effusion cannot be excluded on
 the left due to costophrenic angle blunting.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart is normal in size.  Aortic arch
 calcification is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsened bibasilar atelectasis could obscure pneumonia.
