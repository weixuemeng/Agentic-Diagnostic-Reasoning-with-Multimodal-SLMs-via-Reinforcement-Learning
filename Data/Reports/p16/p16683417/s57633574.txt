 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with post intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.
 ETT is in place with its tip residing approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.  Interstitial opacities are
 similar to prior in this patient with interstitial lung disease.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Difficult to exclude a subtle superimposed
 pneumonia though overall pattern of interstitial opacity is unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately.  Unchanged pattern of interstitial
 opacities compatible with known interstitial lung disease.
