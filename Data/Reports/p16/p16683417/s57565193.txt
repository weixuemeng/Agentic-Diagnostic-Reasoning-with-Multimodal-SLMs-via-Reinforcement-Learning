                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hepatitis / cholangitis now with cough and
 bibasilar rales  // Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest radiograph is from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Both chest radiograph show extensive but heterogeneously distributed
 reticulation in both lungs most pronounced in the anterior segment of right
 upper lobe, axillary region of the left lung, lingula, and probably left lower
 lobe.  There is probably associated bronchiectasis, at least in the left upper
 lobe. Overall findings are most readily explained by fibrosing interstitial
 lung disease with traction bronchiectasis. Abnormality in the lingula is
 probably responsible for partial obscuration of the left heart border. This
 region looks more abnormal today than on ___, as does the right upper
 lobe anterior segment. There could be a component of pneumonia in these
 regions, but but the difference is most likely due to variation in
 radiographic technique.
