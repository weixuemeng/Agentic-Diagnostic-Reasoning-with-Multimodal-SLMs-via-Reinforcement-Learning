                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with diabetes mellitus,
 coronary artery disease and severe exertional dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral nodular opacities
 projecting over the mid lungs represent nipples and should not be mistaken for
 pulmonary nodules.
