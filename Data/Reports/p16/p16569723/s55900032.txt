 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fall from ___ ft neg LOC c/o chest pain  //
 Rule out cardiac abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP view of the chest provided.  Normal positioning a left-sided
 pacemaker and leads.
 
 Lungs are grossly clear.  There is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm and a large gastric bubble. There is a small sliver of
 air immediately inferior to the lateral aspect of left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and a large gastric
 bubble.  Of note, there is a small sliver of air immediately inferior to the
 lateral aspect of left hemidiaphragm.  This is probably projectional, however
 clinical assessment for viscus perforation is recommended.
 
 2. Mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.
