                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted laterally,
 suggesting atelectasis as the posterior costophrenic angels are sharp. 
 Redemonstrated is mild scarring at the right lung base.  There is no evidence
 of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. Again seen is
 a 1 cm left upper lung nodule, less conspicuous as compared to the prior exam.
 The previously identified 1 cm right lower lung pulmonary nodule is not well
 visualized on this exam.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG, with sternotomy wires seen intact and well aligned.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute bony abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Redemonstrated 1 cm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. Recommended
 dedicated chest CT for further evaluation as previously mentioned.
