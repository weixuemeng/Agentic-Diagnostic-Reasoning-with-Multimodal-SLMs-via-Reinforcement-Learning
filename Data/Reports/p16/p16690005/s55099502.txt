                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLL infiltrate incidental finding on CT
 scan  // Evaluate extent of infiltrate.      Evaluate extent of infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Read in conjunction with the abdomen CT ___.
 
 There is no corresponding finding on the chest radiograph, aside from the
 suggestion of mild bronchial wall thickening in the posterior basal segment of
 the left lower lobe.  It is possible that patient had a recent episode of
 aspiration, that cleared in 24 hr.
 
 Lungs elsewhere fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Since I am not sure whether the findings on the abdomen CT
 are accurately displayed on today's chest radiograph, I would maintain
 clinical surveillance to make sure that the patient is not developing
 pneumonia.  In the absence of referable signs, repeat imaging is not
 indicated.
