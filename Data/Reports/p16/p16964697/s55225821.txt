                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hoarseness and chest fullness.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild hyperexpansion of the
 lungs raises the possibility of some chronic pulmonary disease.  However,
 there is no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
