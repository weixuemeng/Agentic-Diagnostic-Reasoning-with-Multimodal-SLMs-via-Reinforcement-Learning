                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for a lung mass in a patient with history of tobacco
 use and recent brain bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 10 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and there is prominent interstitial
 markings and left lower lobe opacification.  There is a large pleural bleb in
 the right mid lung.  There is an old right third callus rib fracture and an
 elliptical opacification overlying the inner lower border of the scapula that
 is most likely due to prior trauma.  The cardiac contour is prominent and
 there are aortic calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperexpanded lungs, a large bleb and prominent interstitial markings is
 consistent with chronic lung disease.
 2. Prominence of the cardiac silhouette and mild vascular congestion is
 consistent with chronic heart disease.
 3.  Left lower lobe consolidation could be due to atelectasis, pleural
 effusion or consolidation and in the appropriate clinical setting is worrisome
 for pneumonia.
