                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:28 p.m.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Compared with prior film, the right IJ
 sheath has been removed.  A tiny pneumothorax at the left lung apex cannot be
 excluded, but no obvious ptx is identified. There is prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to the prior film.  There is mild CHF,
 which appears improved compared with the prior film.  There are small right
 greater than left pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar or slightly improved.
