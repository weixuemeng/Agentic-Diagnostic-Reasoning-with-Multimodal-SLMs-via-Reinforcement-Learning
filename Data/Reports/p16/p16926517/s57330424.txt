                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Prior coronary bypass graft surgery, fever and draining sternal
 wounds.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Hardware
 associated with fixation of the sternum appears unchanged.  The sternum and
 anterior ribs are difficult to assess with radiography, but there is no
 convincing radiographic evidence for bone destruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute abnormality.
