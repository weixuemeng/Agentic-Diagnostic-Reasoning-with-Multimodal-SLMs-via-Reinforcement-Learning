                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea  // assess for edema / pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are lower,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and resulting in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  A moderate sized, partially loculated right
 pleural effusion has substantially increased in size since the prior
 radiograph and a small left pleural effusion has slightly increased. 
 Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or
 infectious pneumonia.
