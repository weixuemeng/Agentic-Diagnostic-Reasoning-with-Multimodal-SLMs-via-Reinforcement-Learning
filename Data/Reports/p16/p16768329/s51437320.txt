                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hyper car PICC was reported failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is slightly rotated.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours remain within normal limits.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates 5.6 cm above the carina.  There is a left IJ central venous
 catheter terminating at the brachiocephalic vein.  A right IJ terminates at
 the mid SVC.  There is no focal consolidation.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  A lucency extends from the left lung laterally to
 below the expected location of the left costophrenic angle.  This is likely
 related to rotated positioning, however underlying pneumothorax cannot be
 entirely excluded.  A dedicated upright radiograph or short-term follow-up
 radiographs could be considered.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:15 AM, 2 minutes after
