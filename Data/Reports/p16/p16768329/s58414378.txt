 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated  // acute process      acute
 process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 stable, as is the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The patient has taken a
 better inspiration, though there is still obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable
 small effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible
 to exclude a retrocardiac pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral
 view.
