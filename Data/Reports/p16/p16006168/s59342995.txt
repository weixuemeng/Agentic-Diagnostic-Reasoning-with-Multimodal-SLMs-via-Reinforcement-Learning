                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable semi upright AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GSW  // assess mediastinum widening
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in patient positioning and low lung volumes,
 mediastinal widening is unchanged.  Heart size is top-normal.  There are new
 opacities at the medial right lung base.  Opacities at the left lung base have
 improved.  Mild linear atelectasis at the left lung base is noted.  An
 endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm superior to the carina.  An
 enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged mediastinal widening consistent with known hematoma.
 2. New opacities at the right lung base may reflect atelectasis, aspiration,
 or developing pneumonia.
