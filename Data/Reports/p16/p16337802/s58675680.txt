 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in extent of the right pleural effusion.  The effusions distribute in a
 slightly different manner, but the overall severity is constant.  Slightly
 improved is a minimal right basal atelectasis.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged position of the venous stent and the double-lumen
 catheter.  Unremarkable left lung.
