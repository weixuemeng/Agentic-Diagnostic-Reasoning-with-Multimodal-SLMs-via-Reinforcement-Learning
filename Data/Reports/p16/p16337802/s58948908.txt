                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post minimally invasive patent foramen
 ovale closure.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a small
 apical pneumothorax.  A right chest tube is unchanged in position.  A superior
 vena cava stent remains in place.  A left IJ catheter tip is positioned at the
 cavoatrial junction, a right subclavian central venous catheter tip is
 positioned in the lower SVC, just beyond the SVC stent.  Lung volumes are low,
 bibasilar atelectasis is resolving.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal, and
 there is interval improvement in azygous distention.  The cardiac silhouette
 and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax, right chest tube is unchanged in
 position.
 2.  Low lung volumes, with resolving bibasilar atelectasis.
