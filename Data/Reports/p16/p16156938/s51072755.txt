                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm with extensive atelectatic change above it.  The
 left lung is well expanded and there is no evidence of acute pneumonia.  No
 vascular congestion.  
 
 Calcification projected over the apices is again seen, most likely related to
 vessels.
