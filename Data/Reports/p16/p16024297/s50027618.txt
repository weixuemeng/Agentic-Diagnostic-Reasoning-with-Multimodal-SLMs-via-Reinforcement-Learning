                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p L segmentectomy  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 15:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema again noted.  The previously
 reported small left apical pneumothorax is not definitively seen on this
 examination. Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which likely
 reflect atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There
 continues to be left lateral pleural thickening which could reflect a
 component of loculated fluid.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult to assess
 due to the opacification at the left base.
