                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma status post
 chemoradiation in ___ and lingular segmentectomy for squamous cell carcinoma.
 He presents for evaluation of tachycardia and hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath tip projects over the expected location of the low SVC. 
 Bibasilar opacities is probably atelectasis in the setting of chronic severe
 pleural thickening move, although infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Peripheral opacity at the right lung base
 adjacent to the fiducial marker reflects changes of radiation fibrosis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive pleural calcification noted on
 the left.  Cardiac silhouette partially obscured by pleural thickening,
 top-normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities more likely atelectasis than infection.
 2. Pleural thickening and chronic radiation changes in the peripheral right
 lower lobe adjacent to the fiducial marker.
