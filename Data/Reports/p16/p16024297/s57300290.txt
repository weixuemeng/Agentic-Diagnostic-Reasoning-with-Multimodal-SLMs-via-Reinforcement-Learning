                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known lung cancer, falling DLCO, and
 worsening dyspnea  // CXR for VQ scan      CXR for VQ scan
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___, and read in
 conjunction with chest CT ___.
 
 The CT scan showed a a new region of perifissural consolidation in the right
 lower lobe that was not designated is FDG avid on the ___ PET scan. 
 There may be greater opacification that region today, projecting inferior to
 the new right central venous infusion port his catheter ends in the low SVC. 
 On the lateral view this region projects posterior to the major fissure and
 anterior to the mid thoracic spine.  I do not know if this is tumor regrowth
 or atelectasis, less likely infection because of its chronicity.
 
 Extensive bilateral pleural thickening largely calcified is not accompanied by
 any appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is top- normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Configuration of the trachea, sagittal elongation of the
 greatest diameter, is due to chronic lung disease and the may be focal
 narrowing from a prior tracheostomy at the level of the thoracic inlet, but
 there has been no change in any of these findings.  .
