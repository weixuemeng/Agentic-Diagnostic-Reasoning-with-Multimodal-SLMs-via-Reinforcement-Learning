                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with PICC for OSH. Evaluate PICC placement. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC line terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein. As
 compared to prior chest CT from ___, right upper lobe consolidation
 is improving. There is still a component of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax. Increased density in the left upper quadrant is
 consistent with an enlarged spleen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left PICC line terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.  No definite
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Improving right upper lobe consolidation with a persistent component of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Splenomegaly.
