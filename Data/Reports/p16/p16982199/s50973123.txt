                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, left AMA ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, ___.  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Diffuse interstitial opacities
 have increased since ___.  Consolidation at the lung bases may be
 partly due to atelectasis given low lung volumes.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening interstitial opacities compatible with the patient's
 history of pulmonary hemorrhage.  In the proper clinical setting, this could
 represent infection.
