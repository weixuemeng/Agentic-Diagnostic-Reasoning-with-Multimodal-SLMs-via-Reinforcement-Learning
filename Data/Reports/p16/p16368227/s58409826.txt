                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with multiple intra-abdominal abscesses, now
 presenting with sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 corresponds with a known small pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or vascular congestion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior.  Mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to multiple recent prior
 examinations.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to multiple
 recent priors.
 2.  Stable small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly
