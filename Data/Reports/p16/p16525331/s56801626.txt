                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML, new fever, question infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip overlying the proximal SVC, near
 the confluence with the innominate vein.  
 
 Note is made of a moderate right convex scoliosis.  Allowing for this, there
 is probable mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinum remains midline.   The aorta is
 unfolded.  No CHF, focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified. 
 Possible slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle. 
 
 The left hilum is asymmetrically prominent, although could be accentuated by
 the scoliosis. Appearance of the left hilum could actually relate to
 enlargement of the main pulmonary artery described on a chest CT from ___.
 Note is made of asymmetry in the density of the lung fields, ? also artifact
 of positioning.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No focal infiltrate identified to suggest pneumonia.
