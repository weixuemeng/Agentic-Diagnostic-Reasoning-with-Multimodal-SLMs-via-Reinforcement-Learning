  Small right midlung opacity laterally could represent atelectasis or scar.
  Given patient's history of suspected malignancy, however, consider
  cross-sectional imaging to further characterize which does not necessarily
  need to be done on an urgent basis.  Moderate hiatal hernia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with +blast cells, likely leukemia.  // Rule out cancer,
 metastasis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a peripheral, pleural-based opacity in the right midlung laterally.
 The the lungs are otherwise clear of focal consolidation or effusion. The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is tortuous.
 Increased retrocardiac opacity is compatible with a moderate hiatal hernia. No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 Small right midlung opacity laterally could represent atelectasis or scar.
 Given patient's history of suspected malignancy, however, consider
 cross-sectional imaging to further characterize which does not necessarily
