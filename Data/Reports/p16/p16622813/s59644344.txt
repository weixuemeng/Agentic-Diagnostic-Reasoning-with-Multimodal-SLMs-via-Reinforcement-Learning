                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute oxygen desaturation event in patient with history of COPD,
 CHF, adenocarcinoma status post right upper lobectomy, admitted for ORIF of
 right femoral neck fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates surgical sutures
 and volume loss in the right upper lobe, consistent with the patient's prior
 history of lobectomy.  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  The
 lungs, however, are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The
 aorta is stably tortuous, and the heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal, and there is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings to explain patient's desaturation event. 
 Stable chronic findings as outlined above.
