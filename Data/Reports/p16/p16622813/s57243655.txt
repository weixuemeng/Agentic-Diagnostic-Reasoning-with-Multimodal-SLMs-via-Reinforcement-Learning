 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___ AT 17:39
 
 Compared to previous study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Enlargement
 of hila is consistent with a combination of enlarged pulmonary arteries and
 right hilar lymph node enlargement as demonstrated on recent CT.  Lungs are
 overinflated, but demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation.  Postoperative
 changes in right hemithorax related to previous lobectomy are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
