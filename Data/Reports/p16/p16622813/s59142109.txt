                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  A subtle area of increased opacity has developed at the left
 lung base and could reflect acute aspiration, developing pneumonia, or
 atelectasis.  Other findings (including postoperative appearance of the right
 hemithorax and enlarged hilar structures due to a combination of enlarged
 pulmonary arteries and right hilar lymphadenopathy) appear unchanged since the
 recent chest radiograph.
