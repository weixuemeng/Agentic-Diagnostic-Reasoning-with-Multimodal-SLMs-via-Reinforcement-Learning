                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___; radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two AP views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is tortuous.  Allowing for
 differences in technique, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is volume loss in the right hemithorax with scarring at the right apex
 that is presumably post-surgical.  Mild chronic-appearing compression
 deformities are poorly visualized along the upper thoracic spine; although
 unlikely to represent acute fractures, there may be some increase in the
 degree of attenuated body heights at one or more levels since the prior CT
 from several years ago.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild mid thoracic vertebral compression fractures, similar to
 slightly increased since the prior CT from ___; although not fully
 characterized, probably chronic.  If symptoms refer to the thoracic spine,
 further imaging assessment could be given consideration.
