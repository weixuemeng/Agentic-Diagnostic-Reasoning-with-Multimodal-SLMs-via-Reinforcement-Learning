 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain and mild hypoxia with
 hypotension  // PNA or effusion?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is scattered subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring in the right upper zone, right base and left base. 
 Question sutures at the left base --___ there been prior surgery at the left
