                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of atrial fibrillation, CHF, presents with
 weakness and fatigue  // eval for fluid overload vs. pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, CTA torso from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an aortic core valve. 
 The heart is again massively enlarged, with change compared to ___
 difficult to evaluate given technique.  There is increased right lower lung
 opacity and cephalization of vessels in the visualized aerated lung.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax is visualized.  Opacity adjacent to the left hilum is
 compatible with known calcified pleural plaque as seen on CT from ___. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Increased right lower lung opacity which could reflect
 a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
