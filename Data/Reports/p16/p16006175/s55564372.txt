                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF  // evaluate for CHF, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed on ___ at 22:31, the
 pulmonary edema has improved.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Dense bibasilar opacities may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and confluent edema.  However, superimposed infection would be
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is an
 oval-shaped opacity projecting over the left lung that spans an area 6.4 x 2.9
 cm, corresponding to the calcified pleural plaque seen on the CTA torso dated
 ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Marked
 cardiomegaly is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion, improved from 5 hr earlier.
 2. Stents bibasilar opacities, likely represent a combination of atelectasis
 and confluent edema.  However, superimposed infection would be difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
