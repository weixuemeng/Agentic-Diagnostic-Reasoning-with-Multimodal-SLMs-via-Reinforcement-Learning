 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left pigtail catheter remains
 in place and there is no definite pneumothorax or re-accumulation of pleural
 fluid. Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax could reflect some layering
 effusion on this side. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the
 possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and volume loss at the left base.
