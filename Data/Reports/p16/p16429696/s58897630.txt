 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___M restrained driver vs guardrail, +LOC, intubated@ OSH for AMS,
 L hemiparesis, R ICA occlusion/thrombus, small right subdural hematoma,
 pancreatitis  now s/p ex lap, G-tube, J-tube, pancreatc drainage ___  //

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification has progressed in both lower lung zones,
 particular the left.  Although this could be asymmetric pulmonary edema high I
 am more concerned about developing Pneumonia, perhaps with minimal concurrent
 pulmonary edema. Heart size is obscured by the elevated diaphragm, but azygos
 vein is mildly distended suggesting elevated central venous pressure or
 volume. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.
