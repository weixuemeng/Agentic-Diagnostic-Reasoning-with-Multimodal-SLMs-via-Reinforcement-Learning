 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach  // Interval change?      Interval
 change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 06:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine study dated ___ at 05:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low and there are is crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature. There are increasing bibasilar opacities with possibly small
 associated effusions. These findings may reflect atelectasis, bibasilar
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised. Given the low lung
 volumes, overall cardiac mediastinal contours are difficult to assess. A left
 subclavian PICC line is remains in place with its tip projecting over the
 proximal SVC.
