 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased there
 are newly bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities. Although the symmetry of
 the changes favors atelectasis, developing pneumonia cannot be excluded and
 should be monitoring by short term chest radiographs. Developing retrocardiac
 atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a
 small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
