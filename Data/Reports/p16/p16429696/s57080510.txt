                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ams from rehab center  // eval pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Tracheostomy tube is noted.
 There is a left upper extremity PICC line again noted with its tip in the mid
 SVC region. Lung volumes are markedly low. Lower lung opacities may reflect
 bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 The upper lungs appear relatively well aerated. The heart size cannot be
 assessed due to low lung volumes. The mediastinal contour is stable. Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line positioned appropriately. Lower lung opacities in the setting of low
 lung volumes may reflect atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
