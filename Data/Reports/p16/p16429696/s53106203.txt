                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M restrained driver vs guardrail, +LOC, intubated@ OSH for AMS,
 L hemiparesis ___ R ICA occlusion/thrombus (stroke), small right subdural
 hematoma, traumatic pancreatitis now s/p ex lap, G-tube, J-tube, pancreatc
 drainage ___  // interval changes?    interval changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 06:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Persistent low lung volumes
 with improved aeration at both bases and decreased ongestion of the perihilar
 vasculature. These findings would suggest that at least some of the findings
 on the prior study correlated with pulmonary edema which has now resolved.
 There is still residual patchy opacity primarily at the left base which may
 reflect atelectasis. There are likely small layering bilateral effusions. No
 pneumothorax is seen. The lung apices are partially obscured by an oxygen
 mask.
