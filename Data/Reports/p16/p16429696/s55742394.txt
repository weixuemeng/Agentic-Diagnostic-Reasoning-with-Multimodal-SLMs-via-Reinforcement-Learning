 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased trach secretions  // acute
 process?      acute process?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are quite low lung
 volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There may be mild elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the left base most likely
 reflects atelectasis and pleural effusion, although in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Mild
 atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
 The appearance of the tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter are
 unchanged.
