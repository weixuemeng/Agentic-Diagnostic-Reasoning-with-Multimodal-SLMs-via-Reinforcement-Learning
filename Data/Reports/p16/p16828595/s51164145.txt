                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Acute cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear except for
 nodular opacities in the left apex, not clearly seen on the prior examination.
 These findings are nonspecific but should be assessed with chest CT to
 evaluate the nature of these new nodular opacities.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
