                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with residual pneumothorax
 after chest tube removal.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line has replaced the Swan-Ganz catheter terminating at
 the level of superior SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected position.  The cardiomegaly is
 substantial and also is associated with prominence of the pulmonary artery
 most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Left pleural effusion is
 noted, small.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
