                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT  // Please evaluate NG position     
 Please evaluate NG position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed. Nasogastric tube extends in normal fashion to the hemidiaphragm, were
 it takes a sharp right return and then proceeds well into the abdomen. This
 most likely reflects gastric bypass surgery, although the course is somewhat
 different from previous examinations. If this appearance is of clinical
 concern, a contrast study could be obtained.
