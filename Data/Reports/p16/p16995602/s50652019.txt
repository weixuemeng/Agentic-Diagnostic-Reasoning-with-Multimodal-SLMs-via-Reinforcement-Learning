                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Small linear densities at
 the left lung base are compatible with mild atelectasis.  An old right
 posterior rib fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
