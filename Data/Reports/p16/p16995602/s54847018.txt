                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left lower rib pain status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is minimal opacification at the left lung base,
 unchanged from the prior exam.  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with
 crowding of bronchovascular markings.  No left-sided rib fractures are
 identified.  If there is concern for rib fractures, then dedicated rib series
 can be obtained.  Old rib deformity along the right rib appears unchanged from
 the prior examination. No pneumothorax.
