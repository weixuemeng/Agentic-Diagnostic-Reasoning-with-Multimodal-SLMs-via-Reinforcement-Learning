                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cirrhosis and worsening encephalopathy. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ radiographs.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear of focal opacities
 concerning for an infectious process, however projecting over the cardiac apex
 on lateral films and the diaphgram on PA views is a 1.3 cm rounded density.
 This was present on prior films and while this may be a nipple, a calcified
 breast nodule is possible as well. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable and unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Old right rib fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) No evidence of pneumonia. 
 2) Opacity projecting over the cardiac apex on lateral views which may be
 calcified breast nodule. Repeat radiographs with nipple markers and shallow
 oblique views can be obtained to better deliniate this. Radiologist should
 review that study before the patient leaves the department.
