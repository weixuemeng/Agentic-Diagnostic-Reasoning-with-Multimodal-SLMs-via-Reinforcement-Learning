 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest radiographs to be obtained prior to upper endoscopy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours

 air-fluid level projects along the lower central mediastinum.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Although the
 hiatal hernia is somewhat more conspicuous, otherwise, there has been no
 significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large hiatal hernia.  No evidence of acute disease.
