                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity
 is present at the left lung base which tethers the hemidiaphragm upward
 somewhat suggesting minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity with volume loss more suggestive of minor atelectasis
 than an infectious process. Correlation with clinical circumstances is
 suggested.
