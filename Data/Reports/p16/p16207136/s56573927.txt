                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, hypotension, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was provided.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  There is subtle bibasilar opacity which represents an
 early pneumonia versus atelectasis.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Hilar vasculature appears slightly prominent.  The bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle bilateral lower lung opacities could represent pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
