                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the heart is present. Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable, as are the hilar contours. Lung volumes are low bilaterally with
 diffuse increased interstitial abnormality which may be chronic.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No definite pulmonary edema is
 seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial abnormality suggestive of a chronic lung disease, and
 correlation with previous imaging is recommended. If none are available,
 further assessment with high resolution chest CT is suggested.
