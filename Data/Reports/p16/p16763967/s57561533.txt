                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is slight
 calcification and mild unfolding along the descending aorta.  Mild subpleural
 apical thickening suggests scarring bilaterally.  Streaky left parahilar
 opacities in the left lower lung suggest mild atelectasis, probably in the
 left lower lobe, although not entirely specific and other etiologies such as
 early bronchopneumonia could be considered.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left lower lobe opacities which may be associated with
 minor atelectasis but other etiologies such as very early bronchopneumonia are
 not excluded.  If pulmonary symptoms are present or for other clinical
 concern, short-term followup radiographs could be considered if clinically
 indicated.
