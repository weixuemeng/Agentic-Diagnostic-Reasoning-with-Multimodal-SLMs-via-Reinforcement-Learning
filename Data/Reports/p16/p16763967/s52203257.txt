                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pain and diffuse abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is similar vague asymmetric
 opacification in the left perihilar region, but elsewhere the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal vague left perihilar opacity.  If pulmonary symptoms
 are present or persist, short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to
 evaluate further, although allowing for differences in technique, there has
 been no definite change.
