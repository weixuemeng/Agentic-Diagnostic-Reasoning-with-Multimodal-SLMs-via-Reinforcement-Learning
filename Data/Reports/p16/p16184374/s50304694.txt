                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Central line placement for GI bleeding.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the SVC.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is moderate
 pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
 right.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 There appears to be a tiny right apical pneumothorax. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant the
 abdomen.
