                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cirrhosis, now with Dobbhoff
 replacement, confirm position of line.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the lower chest was obtained in order to
 illustrate a Dobbhoff line placement.  Such line is identified and seen to
 reach well into the body of the stomach with its metallic dense tip pointing
 towards the pylorus.  The line is in similar position as the one identified on
 ___.  Clinical information indicates, however, that the line has
 been exchanged.  Previously described right internal jugular double-lumen line
 remains in unchanged position terminating in the mid portion of the SVC at the
 level of the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned Dobbhoff line.
