                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cirrhosis, intubated.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on
 ___.
 
 The current study is slightly asymmetric.  The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the
 carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Right internal jugular line tip
 is at the level of superior SVC.  The heart size and mediastinum appear to be
 grossly unchanged.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is noted and there is
 also confluent opacity in the right lower lung that may reflect interval
 development of infectious process but also may be part of edema.  Attention to
 this area after diuresis is recommended.  No pneumothorax is seen.
