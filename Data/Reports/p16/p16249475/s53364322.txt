                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  SBP, treated with albumin, now with high oxygen
 requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval development of pulmonary edema.
 In addition, there is left hilar and lower lobe consolidation.  Although it
 might be part of pulmonary edema, infectious process developed in the interim
 or large aspiration cannot be excluded.  Reassessment of the patient after
 diuresis is required.
