 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Trauma after slip and fall on ice.  Evaluation for
 pneumothorax and fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low and there is
 mild bibasilar atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear without definite
 evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouette is stable.  No displaced rib fractures identified. 
 There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.  If there is strong
 clinical concern for rib fracture dedicated rib series may be performed.
