 HISTORY:  Confusion, HIV.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Low lung volumes can be

 vascular congestion.  Heart is slightly larger, but not to the point of
 cardiomegaly; mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Early cardiac decompensation.
