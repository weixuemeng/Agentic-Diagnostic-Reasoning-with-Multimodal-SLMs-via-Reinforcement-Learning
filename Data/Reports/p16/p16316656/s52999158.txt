                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with history of lung cancer.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above
 the carina.  NG tube terminates below the diaphragm beyond the extent of the
 film.  Single wire of a left chest wall defibrillator terminates in the right
 ventricle.  Sternotomy cerclage wires and mediastinal clips are intact.  Heart
 size is top normal.  Small lower lobe opacities are consistent with
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffusely sclerotic
 appearance of the ribs may represent metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ETT and NGT in appropriate position.  
 2.  Sclerotic appearance of the ribs, nonspecific but consistent with treated
 metastatases.
