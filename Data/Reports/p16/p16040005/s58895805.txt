                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and intoxication.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___ 4.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new opacities at both lung bases, greater on the left than right,
 although mid and low upper lungs remain clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar opacities of substantial extent; although possibly explained by
 atelectasis or pneumonia, findings could be seen with aspiration pneumonitis
 in the appropriate setting.
