 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with alzheimers with increased leukocytosis, and
 cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Increasing opacities in the left retrocardiac
 region could correspond to atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  There are also
 opacities in the right middle lobe.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusions.  There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe and left lower lobe opacities.  In appropriate
 clinical setting, these correspond to pneumonia.
