                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing
 opacification at the right base consistent with further accumulation of
 pleural fluid.  Less prominent opacification is seen on the left.  Bibasilar
 atelectatic change is present, and there is little change in the degree of
 cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascular congestion may be increasing.  Nodular
 lesions in the lungs are again noted, consistent with metastases.
