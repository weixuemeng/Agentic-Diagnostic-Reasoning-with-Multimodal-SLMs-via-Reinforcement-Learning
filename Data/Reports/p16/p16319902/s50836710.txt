                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 multiple surgical clips projecting over the right upper quadrant.  A streaky
 opacity seen across the right lower lung is compatible with scarring.  No
 other focal opacities are noted bilaterally with the exception of biapical
 pleuroparenchymal scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Multiple surgical clips are noted throughout the neck and left supraclavicular
 region.  Deformity of left clavicle appears chronic and post-traumatic. 
 Cervical spine fixation devices are also identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 
 2.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown etiology.
 
 3.  Right clavicular deformity is chronic and likely post-traumatic.
