                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A previously
 seen left-sided PICC has been removed in the interval.  A tube/catheter
 projects over the upper abdomen.  The left base opacity most likely relates to
 atelectasis but in the appropriate clinical setting early consolidation is
 difficult to exclude.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the
 cardiac silhouette normal in size and the aorta calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis
 although in the appropriate clinical setting an early consolidation is not
 excluded.
