                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Three lobulated, smoothly marginated, pleural or extrapleural
 opacities are seen laterally in the upper right hemithorax adjacent to the
 right scapula and adjacent ribs, and could potentially be due to loculated
 pleural fluid or hematoma from adjacent rib or scapular injury given history
 of recent fall and symptoms in this region.  Additionally, there is a
 questionable fracture of the right ninth lateral rib.  There is no visible
 pneumothorax, but a new small right pleural effusion is evident.  Remainder of
 exam is similar in appearance to the prior radiograph, with stable
 cardiomediastinal contours and a persistent cluster of calcifications in the
 left mid lung region corresponding to calcified pleural plaques or calcified
 granulomas.
 
 Dr. ___ was successfully paged to discuss these results on ___
 at 11:20 a.m.  Dedicated rib series could be obtained to more fully assess for
 suspected rib fractures if warranted clinically.
