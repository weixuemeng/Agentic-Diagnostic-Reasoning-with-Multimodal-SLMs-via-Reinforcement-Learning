  Low lung volumes severely limit this examination.  Increased opacities at the
  bases could be crowding of pulmonary vasculature, atelectasis or pneumonia.
  Suggest repeat films with better inspiration.

 INDICATION:  Cough and left flank pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes crowd the
 pulmonary vasculature and severely limit the examination.  Sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips from prior CABG in appropriate position.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac size.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes severely limit this examination.  Increased
 opacities at the bases could be crowding of pulmonary vasculature, atelectasis
 or pneumonia. Suggest repeat films with better inspiration.
