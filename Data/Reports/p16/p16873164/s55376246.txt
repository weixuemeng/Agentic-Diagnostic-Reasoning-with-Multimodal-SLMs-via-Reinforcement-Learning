                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  ET tube is seen with tip approximately 2
 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube seen with tip in the gastric fundus with
 its side port likely in the region of the GE junction.  There is elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with increased right basilar opacity.  Faint left
 basilar opacity is seen as well.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  Multi focal
 sclerotic lesions particularly involving the vertebral bodies are identified,
 worrisome for metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube 2 cm from the carina.  NG tube side port likely in the region of the
 GE junction.  Increased opacity of the right lung throughout the right lung
 with decreased lung volume, potentially atelectasis but other underlying
 pathology is certainly possible.   Findings suggestive of diffuse osseous
 metastases.  
 
 CT had been ordered at time of interpretation.
