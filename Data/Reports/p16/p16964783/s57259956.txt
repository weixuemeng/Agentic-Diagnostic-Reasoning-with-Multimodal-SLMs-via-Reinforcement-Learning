                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of lung adenocarcinoma, now with new
 dysphagia and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart size is within
 normal limits. Rightward shift of mediastinal structures due to right-sided
 volume loss is again noted, with similar appearance of opacity in the right
 upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe right upper lobe
 opacity compatible with known malignancy and associated collapse.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged, and no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky
 opacities are seen in the left lung base, potentially areas of atelectasis.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multilevel degenerative changes
 are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous study. Similar appearance of
 opacity in the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe
 compatible with known malignancy and associated collapse. Streaky opacities in
 the left lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
