                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Ill-defined
 opacities in the lung apices may reflect apical scarring.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The ascending aorta appears
 tortuous.  Heart size is top normal.  ICD leads project over right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable aside from surgical
 clips projecting over right upper and mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
