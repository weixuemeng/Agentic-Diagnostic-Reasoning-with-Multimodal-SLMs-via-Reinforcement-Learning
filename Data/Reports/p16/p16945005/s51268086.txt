                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and change in mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior study, there is a new collection of fluid in the left pleural place. 
 Bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests possible small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation,
 vascular congestion, or pneumothorax.  A pacemaker is located in the left
 hemithorax with leads ending in the right atrium and in right ventricle.  The
 heart size is normal.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper abdomen. 
 There are no concerning osseous lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New collection of fluid in the left pleural space.  To determine
 if the collection is free fluid or loculated, bilateral decubitus films are
 recommended.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
