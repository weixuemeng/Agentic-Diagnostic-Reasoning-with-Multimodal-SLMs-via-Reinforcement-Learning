                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles on exam in a patient with a history of CHF. Evaluate for
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from approximately 3 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a central catheter
 with the tip in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction, multiple sternal wires, a
 valvular prosthesis, and surgical hardware.  There is mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation is
 definitely seen, although the lower lungs are difficult to evaluate secondary
 to bibasilar atelectasis and left greater than right small pleural effusions,
 unchanged from the prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial edema, bibasilar atelectasis, and left greater than right
 small to moderate pleural effusions. No focal consolidation definitely seen,
 although the lower lungs are difficult to evaluate.
