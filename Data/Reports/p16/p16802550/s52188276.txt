                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with leukocytosis, recent fall, hip pain  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and abdominal CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar opacities better seen as focal consolidation, potentially with
 rounded atelectasis and trace right pleural effusion on prior CT.  Blunting of
 the posterior costophrenic angles is noted on the left due to prominent
 extrapleural fat and atelectasis versus scarring.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged. Median sternotomy wires, plates and mediastinal clips are noted.
 Mitral annular calcification and prosthetic valve are noted. Right-sided
 central venous catheter tip is noted within the right atrium. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity compatible with region of consolidation likely due to
 rounded atelectasis and trace effusion as seen on same day CT abdomen.
