  Median sternotomy wires, mitral valve replacement, dialysis catheter, all

  central venous catheter. Interval increase in right basilar opacity, possibly
  worsening pulmonary edema or developing pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions
  left greater than right, likely similar given differences in patient position
  to the prior study from ___.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Right HD catheter tip is in
 cavoatrial junction. Increasing opacities in the right lung could represent
 asymmetric edema, infection is less likely. Stable opacities in the right base
 are a combination of atelectasis and small effusion . Small left effusion is
 stable. Sternal wires and sternal plates are aligned. Patient is status post
 CABG
