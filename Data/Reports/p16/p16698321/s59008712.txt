                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/o weakness and cough  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right mid lung opacity raises concern for infection. Left basilar retrocardiac
 opacity is also seen attributed atelectasis although second site of infection
 is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 2 lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mid lung opacity raises concern for pneumonia. Patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis but additional site of
 pneumonia is not excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able
 may be helpful for further evaluation.
