                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The dual-lead
 pacer is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior with
 a markedly unfolded thoracic aorta.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattened diaphragms and widened diameter of the chest which is compatible
 with COPD.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD, no superimposed consolidation.
