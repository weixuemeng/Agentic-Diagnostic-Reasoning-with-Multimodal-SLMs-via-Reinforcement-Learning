                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post fall with clavicle fracture. 
 Evaluate for acute abnormality.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The heart is normal in size, and
 the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 
 Fracture of the distal left clavicle is
  incompletely imaged.  Although no other acute fracture or other chest wall
 lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for
 detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration
 of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any
 referrable focal findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either
 bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Left clavicle fracture.
