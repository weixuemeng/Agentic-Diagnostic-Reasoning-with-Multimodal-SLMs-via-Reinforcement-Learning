                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to
 lung and airways.  Metallic stent in place, evaluate stent placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable single view chest examination of ___.  Heart size is
 unchanged and the same holds for the appearance of the thoracic aorta. 
 Previously described right-sided perihilar mass, grossly unchanged. Within
 this density one can identify the metallic structures of the stent, which has
 been placed in the right-sided main bronchus partially seen to occupy portions
 of the carina.  There is no evidence of any airway obstruction through the
 stent.  There is no evidence of new atelectasis distal to the stent which
 ventilates the area of the right lower and middle lobes.  Comparison of the
 frontal views; however, suggests new local parenchymal density in the central
 portion of the right middle lobe as can be identified also on the lateral
 view.  The previously identified increased interstitial markings in the left
 upper lobe persist and may have increased slightly.  They are believed to
 represent interstitial carcinomatosis.  The lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free, thus there is no evidence of significant pleural
 effusion.  The on multiple previous examinations identified abnormalities and
 local pleural thickening in the right axillary area remain grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of main bronchus stent occlusion.  Some progression
 of pulmonary abnormalities is, however, noted.
