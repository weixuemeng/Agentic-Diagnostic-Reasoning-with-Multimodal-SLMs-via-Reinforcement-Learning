                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy, stent placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study, the right perihilar tumor is
 again seen with some heterogeneous opacification at the right base, which
 could represent aspiration.  No definite evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels.  It is unclear whether this
 could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous pressure or possibly a more
 supine position of the patient.
