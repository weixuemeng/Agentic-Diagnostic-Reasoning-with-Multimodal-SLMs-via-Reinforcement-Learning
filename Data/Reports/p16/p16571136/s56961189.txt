                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with stridor and
 dyspnea.  Evaluate for stent migration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The stent overlies the right cardiac border likely within the
 bronchus intermedius, and does not appear significantly changed in position
 since the prior exam.  Again, there is a right hilar mass, which appears
 similar.  Multiple pleural nodules are also stable.  There is no new focal
 airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in the position of the right-sided bronchial stent.
 2.  No significant change in appearance of the right hilar and multiple other
 pleural metastases.  No evidence of an acute pneumonia is identified.
