                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in patient status post tracheal
 stent removal and tumor debulking with known renal cell carcinoma metastasis
 to the lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___,
 CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to
 the prior studies.  The tracheal stent in the right main bronchus has been
 removed.  Right perihilar opacity represents metastatic disease that has
 significantly decreased since ___ due to radiation therapy. 
 Multiple nodules seen throughout both lung fields are better characterized on
 the previous CT of ___.  New increased opacification in the left
 upper lung could be due to patient rotation or an infectious process.  Normal
 cardiac, pleural and mediastinal surfaces. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity in the left upper lung could be due to patient rotation
 or an infectious etiology if clincal symptoms are present.  
 2.  The right hilar opacity corresponds to known metastatic disease and has
 significantly decreased in size since ___ due to radiation
