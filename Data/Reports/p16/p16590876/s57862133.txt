                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Runny nose, intense dizziness, nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The hilar contours are normal.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Calcified granulomas within the lungs
 bilaterally are unchanged.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
