 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Calcified pulmonary nodules in both
 lungs are unchanged, reflective of granulomas.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of underlying COPD.  Old right-sided
 rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
