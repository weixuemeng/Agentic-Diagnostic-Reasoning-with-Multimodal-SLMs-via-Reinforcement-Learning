                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath; history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is prominent and indistinct
 central interstitium with prominent pulmonary vascularity suggesting
 mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.  In addition, there is a moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion which has increased with associated opacity,
 which can probably be attributed to atelectasis, but underlying pneumonia is
 also a possibility.  A trace left-sided pleural effusion is suspected.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Moderate anterior osteophyte formation is noted along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Similar mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.  
 
 2.  Increasing small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion with associated
 parenchymal opacification and volume loss, possibly atelectasis, although an
 infectious cause is a possible consideration.  
 
 3.  Persistent nodular focus projecting over the right mid lung, likely nipple
 shadow.  However, when clinically appropriate, evaluation with an additional
 PA view with nipple markers is suggested to evaluate further. 
 
 Recommendation for follow-up PA view with nipple markers discussed with Dr.
 ___ by telephone on ___ at 6 pm.
