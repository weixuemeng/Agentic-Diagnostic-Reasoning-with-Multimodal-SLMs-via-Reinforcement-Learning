 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hemodialysis, incidental nodule on chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Status post sternotomy.  Severe cardiomegaly with fluid overload and
 right pleural effusion as well as subsequent atelectasis.  The rounded opacity
 described on the previous chest x-ray is still visible, projecting over the
 ventral parts of the fifth right rib.  The opacity is constant in size and
 morphology.  The constant projection over the rib suggests a bony island of
 the rib.  To exclude that the lesion corresponds to the nipple, a repeat
 radiograph with nipple marker should be performed.
 
 No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
