                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of lower extremity edema
 and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  There is also mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is a subtle more focal opacity seen projecting
 over the right mid lung over the anterior right fifth rib, may relate to
 prominent vascular structures, less likely an additional focus of
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions and
 pulmonary vascular congestion suggest CHF.
