                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F POD 5 lumpectomy p/w axillary pain and leukocytosis 
 // consolidation or other acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
 No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Dense soft tissue
 opacification in the left chest related to recent breast surgery likely
 accounts for hazy increased opacity in the left mid and lower lung regions.  A
 small air-fluid level in the left breast anteriorly is probably postoperative.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense soft tissue opacification in the left chest related to recent breast
 surgery likely accounts for hazy increased opacity in the left mid and lower
 lung regions.  If clinical suspicion for infection persists, short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful to fully exclude pneumonia in this region.
