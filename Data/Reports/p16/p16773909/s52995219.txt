 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the lateral view
 posteriorly could suggest a minimal effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sulcus posteriorly on the right could
 suggest a tiny pleural effusion.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
