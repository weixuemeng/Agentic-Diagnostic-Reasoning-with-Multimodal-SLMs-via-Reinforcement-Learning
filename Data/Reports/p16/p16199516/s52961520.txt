                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is unchanged, borderline enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Previously noted asymmetric
 opacification in the right lung base has essentially resolved.  The lungs are
 clear.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal fluid is noted within the
 fissures, unchanged.  No sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Previously noted right basilar opacification has resolved suggesting that the
 prior finding was likely due to asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
