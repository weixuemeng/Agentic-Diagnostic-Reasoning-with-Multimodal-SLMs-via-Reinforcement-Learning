                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size, at the upper limits of normal. 
 There is moderate unfolding of the descending aorta.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is asymmetric opacification of the
 right lung, compared to the left, particularly involving central regions and
 especially the right lower lobe.  Aside from streaky left basilar opacities,
 the left lung appears clear.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Fissures are
 slightly thickened.  A few Kerley B lines can be seen at each lung base. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative
 changes are similar along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asymmetric opacification of the right mid and lower lung relative
 to the left, most suggestive of pneumonia, although there may be a component
 of fluid overload noting Kerley B lines at both lung bases.  If pneumonia is
 discordant with clinical findings, then perhaps an unusual asymmetric pattern
 of pulmonary congestion could be considered in the appropriate setting.
