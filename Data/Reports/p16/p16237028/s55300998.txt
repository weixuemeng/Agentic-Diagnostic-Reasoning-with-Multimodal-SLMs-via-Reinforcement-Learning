                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, short of breath.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with probable atelectasis at left-
 greater-than-right bases.  Mild upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated
 by low lung volumes.  No overt CHF.  No gross effusion.  The atelectasis is
 slightly more pronounced than suggested on a CT from ___.  
 
 The CT also revealed bilateral small lung nodules -- a small density seen at
 the extreme lateral aspect of the left lung base may correspond to one of
 those nodules.  Otherwise, they are not apparent radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low isnpiratory volumes. L>R bibasilar atelectasis.
