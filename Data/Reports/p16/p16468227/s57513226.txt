 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell cancer, intubation.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.6 cm above the carina,
 tube is well positioned.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.  The previously placed right subclavian line has been removed. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen.  The
 opacities are dependent and combined to widening of the mediastinum and
 increase in diameter of the pulmonary vessels.  Overall, these findings
 suggest moderate pulmonary edema.  The presence of small pleural effusion
 might not be excluded.  The displayed parts of the stomach are overinflated,
 so that placement of a nasogastric tube might be considered.
