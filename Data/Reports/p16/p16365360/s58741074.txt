                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with mental status change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous left lung base opacity is
 present.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  Multiple surgical clips
 project over the mediastinum.  Sternotomy wires appear intact.  Partially
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  A 4-mm round density projecting over
 left lung apex likely represents a calcified granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Left lung base heterogeneous opacity can be further assessed with
 conventional radiographs or CT.  Prior exams, if available for comparison,
 will be helpful.
