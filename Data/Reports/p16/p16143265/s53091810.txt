                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Malnutrition, feeding tube, evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has
 been advanced.  The contour of the gastric air bubble as well as the course of
 the catheter suggests coiling in the stomach rather than a position in the
 region of the ileocecal fold.
 
 No evidence of complications.  Unchanged appearance of the lung bases and the
 cardiac silhouette.
