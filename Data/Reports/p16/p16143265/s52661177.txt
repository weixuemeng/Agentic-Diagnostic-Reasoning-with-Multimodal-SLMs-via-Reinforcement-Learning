                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital carrying a
 diagnosis of fungal pneumonia; while at rehab, had worsening dyspnea on
 exertion and palpitations while walking; also bilateral lower extremity
 swelling.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is slightly enlarged, possibly exaggerated by AP
 positioning.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic
 disease of aortic knob and a mildly tortuous aorta.  The lungs demonstrate
 mildly heterogeneous parenchyma with vascular congestion.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings is more prevalent on the left with more subtle airspace
 consolidation at the right base.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Additionally, the left PICC courses
 across midline into the right brachiocephalic vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Mild cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions; subtle left lower lobe airspace opacity.  The findings most likely
 represent mild pulmonary edema with a superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Comparison with prior imaging may be helpful.
 2. Left PICC tip in right brachiocephalic vein; this finding was discussed
 with IV nurse ___ by ___ at 9:45 am on ___.
