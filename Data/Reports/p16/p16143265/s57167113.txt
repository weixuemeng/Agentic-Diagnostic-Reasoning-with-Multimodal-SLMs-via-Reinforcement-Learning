 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia, evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray, evaluation for
 interval change, evaluation for free intra-abdominal air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation at the left lung base, with subsequent decrease in severity of the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacity.  This opacity, mainly reticular in
 appearance, however, is still clearly visible.  It could reflect pneumonia.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged appearance of the right lung base,
 with persisting blunting of the costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a
 minimal right pleural effusion.  Unchanged minimal focal right apical
 thickening.  No evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
