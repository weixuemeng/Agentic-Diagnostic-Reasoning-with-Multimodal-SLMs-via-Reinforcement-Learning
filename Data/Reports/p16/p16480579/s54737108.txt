 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LLL  // check interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left apical pneumothorax is no
 longer visible. Also resolved are the multiple air-fluid levels, described in
 the previous report. Neither the frontal border lateral radiograph of today's
 image show presence of pleural effusions. Per normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumonia. Minimal
 left lower lobe atelectasis. A 4-5 mm rounded structure at the right lung
 bases probably reflects the nipple, it should receive attention on the next
 followup, the structure projects over the dorsal parts of the tenth rib.
