                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison was made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild vascular congestion is new.  Increase in widening of the mediastinum is
 likely due to engorgement of the vessels.  The aorta is tortuous.  The main
 pulmonary arteries are enlarged.  There is pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia.
