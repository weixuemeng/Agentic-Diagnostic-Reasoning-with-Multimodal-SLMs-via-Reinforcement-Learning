 Status post right lower lobe VATS procedure with subsequent scarring and
 staple lines.
 
 The lung volumes are slightly lower than the previous image.  At the left lung
 base, there is a minimal increase in density, notably in the peribronchial
 areas, combined to vary subtle nodularity.  The changes only appreciated on
 the PA view.  This subtle change could represent pneumonia.  The referring
