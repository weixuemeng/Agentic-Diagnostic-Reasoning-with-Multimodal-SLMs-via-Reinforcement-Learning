                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with rib fractures, status post MVC,
 evaluate rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding chest examination of ___.  On previous portable
 examination identifiable pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates have now resolved. 
 With the exception of a linear thin plate atelectatic change in the left mid
 field, no acute parenchymal pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Heart size is
 within normal limits, and no pulmonary vascular congestion exists.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax are grossly unremarkable on the PA and lateral chest
 examination.  On a previous CT torso examination of ___, three rib
 fractures were identified on the left side involving ___ 3 through 6.  They
 were noticed along the lateral circumference of the ribs, but no major
 displacement was seen.  It is impossible to identify these changes on the
 routine PA and lateral chest examination.  It can be stated, however, that
 there is no local thickening of the pleural space or any callus formation.
