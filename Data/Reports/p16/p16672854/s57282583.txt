 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and hypoxia, question acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There are lower lung opacities
 which is potential concern for pneumonia.  There is no large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild central hilar congestion is somewhat improved from prior
 exam.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 No definite signs of pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung opacities which could represent atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.  Possible mild congestion.
