                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 Evidence of previous CABG.  The heart remains enlarged.  Some vascular
 congestion appears to be present suggesting mild failure.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are seen, but focal pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
