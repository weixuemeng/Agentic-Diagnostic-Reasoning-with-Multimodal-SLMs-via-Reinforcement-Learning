                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  moderate cardiomegaly persists.  There are new diffuse bilateral
 hazy opacities suggestive of moderate increase in pulmonary central venous
 pressure.  Mid sternotomy wires appear intact.  Lungs are without focal
 consolidation.  Bilateral small pleural effusions may be present.  No acute
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral hazy opacities with persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly.  These findings are likely representative of moderate pulmonary
 edema due to congestive heart failure.
