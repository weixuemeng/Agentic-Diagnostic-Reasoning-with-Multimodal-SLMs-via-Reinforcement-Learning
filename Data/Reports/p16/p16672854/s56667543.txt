                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cholangitis status post stent placement and
 removal of stones, now with new oxygen requirement.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 versus pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recent chest radiograph performed 11 hours
 prior.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Opacities have slightly worsened in the
 axillary portion of the right lung and also in the right lower lobe,
 concerning for pneumonia in these areas.  In addition, there is asymmetric
 pulmonary edema which has improved in the left lung but has also worsened in
 the right lung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable.  There may
 be trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
