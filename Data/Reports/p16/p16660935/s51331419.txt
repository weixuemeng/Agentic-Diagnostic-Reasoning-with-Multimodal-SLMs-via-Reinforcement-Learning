                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest.  // ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is obscured and the possibility of an right-sided effusion,
 together with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, cannot be excluded. 
 There is also hazy opacity in the right lung, question due to layering pleural
 fluid or parenchymal opacification.  The right lung apex remains relatively
 aerated.
 
 On the left, there is minimal upper zone redistribution, but the left lung is
 grossly clear.  The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film,
 but no left effusion.
 
 No pneumothorax detected on this lordotic film.
 
 ET tube tip 4.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube likely present, but tip obscured
 due to over penetration.  Fixation hardware overlies the cervicothoracic
 junction, not fully evaluated.  Incidental note is made of clips over the
 right axilla.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.
 
 Probable layering right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Opacity in the left upper and mid zones is not fully
 characterized --  this could be accentuated by layering pleural fluid, but the
 presence of parenchymal opacity cannot be excluded.
 
 Left lung grossly clear.
 
 ET tube in satisfactory position.  NG tube difficult to trace beyond the mid
 mediastinum.
