                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  A poorly defined lung nodule is again demonstrated in the periphery
 of the right upper lobe between the second and third anterior right rib
 levels.  A second right upper lobe nodule is partially obscured by the
 overlying scapula and is located just below the right third anterior rib.  A
 third nodule is seen centrally within the right lower lobe just lateral to the
 right heart border.  These nodules were all better characterized on CT of the
 chest of ___.  They are not ideally assessed by chest
 radiography, but appear roughly similar compared to prior chest radiographs. 
 Lungs are otherwise remarkable for combined pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  The patient
 is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. 
 No pleural effusion or acute skeletal finding.  Fractured inferior sternal
 wires are without change.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Three right lung nodules are grossly unchanged compared to prior
 chest radiographs, so CT would be much more sensitive for detecting interval
 growth as compared to prior chest CT of ___.
