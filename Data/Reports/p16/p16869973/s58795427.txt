                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity edema and swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is moderately tortuous.  Otherwise,
 the mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a trace pleural
 effusion on the right.  A trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on
 the left side.  Fissures are slightly thickened.  Aside from vague opacity
 suggesting minor atelectasis along posterior costophrenic sulci, the lungs
 appear clear without findings suggestive of parenchymal edema.
 Mild degenerative changes affect the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace right-sided pleural effusion, at least on the right side. Suspected mild
 posterior basilar atelectasis, probably bilateral.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
