                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma.  Rule out metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating borderline cardiomegaly.  Vascular
 crowding at the lung bases could obscure small lung lesions, but there is no
 good candidate for pulmonary metastasis and no evidence of pneumonia or
 cardiac decompensation.  Pleural surfaces are normal and there is no finding
 of central lymph node enlargement.
