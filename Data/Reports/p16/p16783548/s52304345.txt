                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  Retrocardiac streaky opacity may reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with retrocardiac patchy opacity possibly reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
