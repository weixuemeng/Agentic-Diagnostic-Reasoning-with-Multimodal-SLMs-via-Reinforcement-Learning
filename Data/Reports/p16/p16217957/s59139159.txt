 There is a left sided catheter projecting over the left apex with evacuation
 of apical effusion and small collection of residual air. Unchanged left
 basilar opacity obscures the hemidiaphragm, likely secondary to fluid and/or
 atelectasis. Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. There is no new area of consolidation.

 1. Evacuation of left apical pleural effusion by pigtail catheter with small
 collection of residual air in the left apex.
 2. Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis and/
 or effusion.
