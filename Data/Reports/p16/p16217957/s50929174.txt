                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with delirium
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large left pleural effusion has substantially increased in size compared to
 the previous radiograph. Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Left basilar opacity
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base also could reflect atelectasis. Trivial
 right pleural effusion is present. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of left pleural effusion which is now large with left basilar
 opacity, likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. Patchy right
 basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis. Tiny right pleural effusion.
