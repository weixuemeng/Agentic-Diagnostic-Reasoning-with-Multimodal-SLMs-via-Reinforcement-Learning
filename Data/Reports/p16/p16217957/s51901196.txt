                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening oxygen requirement  // eval for
 edema, pna      eval for edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.  Read in
 conjunction with images of the lower lungs on an abdomen CT performed ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate bilateral layering nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion, and
 relatively mild subpleural atelectasis were seen at both Lung bases on ___. Greater opacification at both lung bases than on ___ suggests that
 both pleural effusion and lung abnormalities have increased. Nevertheless I
 can't say whether the lung findings are due to greater atelectasis alone or
 pneumonia.  Even though the patient has chronic moderate cardiomegaly, the
 upper lungs however have no findings to suggest that pulmonary edema is
 present, specifically no vascular engorgement.
