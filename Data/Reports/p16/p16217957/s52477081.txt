                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Low lung volumes causes crowding the bronchovascular structures
 without overt pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not
 substantially changed in the interval, with bibasilar opacities, more
 pronounced on the left, likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
 Infection is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse degenerative
 changes are again seen within the thoracic spine with mild compression
 deformities of several upper lumbar vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. Please
 note that infection in the lung bases however cannot be completely excluded.
