                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob hypoxia  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACS at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  Retrocardiac opacity with
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle may reflect
 atelectasis and/or infection in the appropriate clinical situation.  A left
 pleural effusion is small.  Right lung is clear except for minor atelectasis
 at the base.  Aortic knob calcifications are moderate.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Low lung volumes.  Left lower lobe opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis and effusion; however concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  When the patient is able, return for PA and lateral
 radiographs could be performed to better assess the left lung base.
