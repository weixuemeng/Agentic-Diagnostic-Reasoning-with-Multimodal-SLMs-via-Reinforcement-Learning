                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lethargy and cough  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None currently available on PACS.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures may be due to low lung volumes.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Small left
 pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Well corticated ossific densities are noted projecting over both glenohumeral
 joints, likely loose bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.  Infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There may be a small left pleural
 effusion.
