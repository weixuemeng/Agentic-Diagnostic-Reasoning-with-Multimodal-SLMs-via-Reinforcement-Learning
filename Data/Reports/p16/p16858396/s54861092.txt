                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  The hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 does not appear engorged.  Diffuse calcified bilateral pleural plaques are
 noted, which limits assessment of underlying lung parenchyma.  No definite
 focal consolidation is visualized.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes of the left acromioclavicular joint
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse calcified bilateral pleural plaques are compatible with
 prior asbestos exposure.  These pleural plaques limit assessment of underlying
 lung parenchyma, but no definite large focal consolidation is seen.  No
 congestive heart failure.
