                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?AML and worsening ___  // Eval SOB, ?fluid
 overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest x-ray from___ from ___ ,
 on PACs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy. There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
 Compared with the prior film, there is new CHF, with upper zone
 redistribution, thickening of the minor fissure, and diffuse vascular
 blurring. More patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region could reflect
 vascular plethora and atelectasis, but the possibility of an early infiltrate
 cannot be excluded. Otherwise, no consolidation. No gross effusions.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with CHF. Patchy at the opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 region could due to CHF, but the possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate
 cannot be entirely excluded. Attention to this area on followup films is
 requested.
