                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest pain with tender to palpation lateral 10th rib.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest and 3 additional views of
 the right-sided ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ no prior rib radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest:  Minimal basilar atelectasis is seen.  There is no focal consolidation.
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated,
 with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The bones
 are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 Right-sided ribs.  No displaced fracture is seen; however, please note that
 the lower most ribs are not well assessed on this study due to overlying soft
 tissue.  If high clinical concern for rib fracture, consider CT.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No definite rib fracture is seen, however,
 please note that the lower right-sided ribs are not optimally evaluated due to
 overlying soft tissue and if there is high clinical concern for rib fracture,
 consider CT.
