                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  The endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is within
 the stomach.  Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Assessment of the mediastinal and hilar contours is limited.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Marked degenerative changes are noted involving the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination due to patient rotation.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes
 in standard positions.  Streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
