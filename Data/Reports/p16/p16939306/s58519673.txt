                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ as well as a CT
 torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 consolidation at the right lung base with probable small right pleural
 effusion.  Findings may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.  Left lung is clear.
 No signs of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity likely a combination of consolidation and
 effusion.  Consolidation may reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
