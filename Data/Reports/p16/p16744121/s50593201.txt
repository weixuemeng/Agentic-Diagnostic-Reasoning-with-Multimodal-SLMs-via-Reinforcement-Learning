                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic breast cancer to spine now s/p
 L2-L4 posterior decompression and instrumentation.  // interval change    
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter is been removed
 and replaced with a sheath.  Endotracheal tube tip remains in good position. 
 The areas of increased opacification at the right base have decreased, most
 likely reflecting improved atelectasis.  However, there is increased
 opacification at the left base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  This
 raises the possibility of substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe,
 possibly due to a mucous plug.
