                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at least at the upper limits of normal size, and may
 be somewhat enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild relative elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is noted.  The lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat prominent heart size for age; clinical correlation is
 suggested.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, however.  When
 clinically appropriate, short-term followup standard PA and lateral
 radiographs may be helpful to reassess the cardiac contour.
