                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, history of COPD and lung cancer status post
 lobectomy, recent PE, presents with increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval increase in small amount of pleural fluid
 in the lower right hemithorax. Minimal increase in the interstitial lines at
 the left base could be a sign of very mild pulmonary edema.
 
 Volume of the partially resected right lung volume is unchanged. Stable
 rightward mediastinal shift and stable post-surgical changes seen about the
 right hilum.  The left lung is clear.  There are no focal consolidations
 clearly infectious in nature; however, given postoperative distortion,
 consolidation in the basal right lung cannot be excluded.  Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC, shifted into the right hemithorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Small increase in small right pleural effusion and possible mild pulmonary
 edema.  
 2) Though there is no clear evidence of infection, given postoperative
 distortion, there might be an area of consolidation in the right lower lung
 due to pneumonia.
