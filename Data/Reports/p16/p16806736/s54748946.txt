                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, non-small cell lung cancer, status post a right
 upper lobe resection, and stage III esophageal cancer, status post radiation. 
 New shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is status post a right upper lobe resection with stable
 pleural changes at the apex.  Radiation changes and volume loss are stable in
 the right mid lung zone.  At the right base, there has been a slight increase
 in the previously seen pleural effusion with new volume loss and rightward
 mediastinal shift suggesting atelectasis in that region.  There is a new small
 pleural effusion at the left base.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left port
 ends in the low SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Increase in size of small right pleural effusion and new small left
 pleural effusion. 
 2)  Right basilar atelectasis.
 3)  No evidence of pneumonia.
