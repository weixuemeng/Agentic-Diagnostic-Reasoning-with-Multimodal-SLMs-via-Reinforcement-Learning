                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung is well-expanded and clear. There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, which results in crowding of the right cardiophrenic angle by
 hilar vessels limiting assessment.  However, there may be patchy opacity in
 this region as the degree of opacification is felt to be more than expected. 
 There is leftward shift of the mediastinum due to elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  Otherwise cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings raise concern for possible pneumonia of the right middle or lower
 lobe pneumonia although elevation of the right hemidiaphragm results in
 crowding of the right cardiophrenic angle by right hilar structures, limiting
 assessment.
