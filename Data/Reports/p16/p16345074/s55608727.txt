                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic valve replacement, congestive heart failure with altered
 mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. 
 There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with the heart size appearing normal.  The aorta remains tortuous
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic mural calcifications.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Streaky linear opacities in
 both lung bases are demonstrated, and could reflect atelectasis or scarring. 
 No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints and right glenohumeral
 joint are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis or scarring with chronic elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise noted.
