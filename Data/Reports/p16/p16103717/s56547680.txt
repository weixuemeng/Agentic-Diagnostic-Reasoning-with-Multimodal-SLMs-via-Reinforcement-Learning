                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with rib fractures and pneumothorax for
 comparison.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ CT and chest radiographs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph was obtained.
 
 Right subclavian catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  Right chest tube has
 been removed with tiny residual right apical pneumothorax.  Irregular
 opacification surrounding a faint rounded lucency in the right mid lung likely
 corresponds to known laceration.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac size
 and silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Tiny residual apical right pneumothorax.
