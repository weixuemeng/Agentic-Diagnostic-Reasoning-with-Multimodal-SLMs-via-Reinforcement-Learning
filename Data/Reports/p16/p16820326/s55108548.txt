 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increasing pulmonary vascular
 congestion and new mild interstitial edema.  There is persistent retrocardiac
 opacification similar to prior radiograph and CT, findings consistent with
 chronic atelectatic scarring.  No new confluent opacity is identified.  There
 is no large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac atelectatic scarring.
 3.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
