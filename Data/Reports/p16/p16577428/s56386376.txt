                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic anal cancer, on chemotherapy, presenting
 with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded and clear, without focal airspace
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A right Port-A-Cath terminates near the superior cavoatrial
 junction, in stable position.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal without
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
