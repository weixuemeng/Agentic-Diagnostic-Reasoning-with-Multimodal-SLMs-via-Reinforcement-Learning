                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance, but
 decrease in size compared to the prior exam. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  Previous pattern of mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears
 slightly improved.  Patient is status post right shoulder arthroplasty. No
 acute osseous abnormalities are detected. Remote left-sided rib fractures are
 re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases, likely atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly are improved in
 the interval.
