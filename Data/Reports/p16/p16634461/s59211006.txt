 WET READ: ___ ___ 4:24 PM
  1. Significant widening of the vascular pedicle compared with the prior exam
  cannot be completely explained with technical differences and raises concern
  for aortic aneurysm which should be further assessed with chest CT.
  
  2. Interstitial pulmonary edema on the setting of newly developed
  cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status. Evaluate for
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiograph, lung volumes are slightly lower which may
 account for bronchovascular crowdin.  However these technical differences are
 not felt to completely justify the significant interval increase in widening
 of the vascular pedicle as well as interval increase in cardiac size. There
 are no focal opacities but the interstitial markings are more prominent than
 in the previous exam. There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Widening of the vascular pedicle compared with the prior exam, while could
 be related to technical differences and different lung volumes, underlying
 aortic aneurysm is not excluded and which should be further assessed with
 chest CT.
 
 2.  Interstitial pulmonary edema on the setting of newly developed
 cardiomegaly.
