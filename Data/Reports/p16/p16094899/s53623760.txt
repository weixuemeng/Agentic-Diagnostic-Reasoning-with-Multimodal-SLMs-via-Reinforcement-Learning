                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachycardia metastatic prostate ca  //
 interval left pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, there has been little change in
 the appearance of the chest except for new hazy increased opacity in the right
 lower hemi thorax, probably representing a partially layering pleural effusion
 on this apparently semi upright radiograph.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 and adjacent retrocardiac opacity are not appreciably changed allowing for
 positional differences.
