                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, tachycardia and pleural effusion seen
 on portal chest x-ray  // Assess for infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a small to moderate left
 pleural effusion has slightly increased in size and a small right pleural
 effusion is also demonstrated.  Adjacent bibasilar opacities probably
 represent atelectasis although superimposed infectious pneumonia in the left
 lower lobe is not excluded.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for widespread
 sclerotic metastases, likely related to previously provided history of
 prostate cancer.
