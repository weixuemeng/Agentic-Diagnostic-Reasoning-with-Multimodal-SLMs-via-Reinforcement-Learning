 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at thoracic inlet.  The dual-lumen
 right internal jugular catheter remains in place with its tip in the proximal
 SVC.  There is a persistent but worsening bilateral airspace and interstitial
 abnormality most likely representing worsening pulmonary edema.  More
 confluent retrocardiac opacity persists and may represent partial lower lobe
 collapse.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Marked degenerative changes of both
 glenohumeral joints.
