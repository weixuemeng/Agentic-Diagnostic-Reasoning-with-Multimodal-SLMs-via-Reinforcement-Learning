                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multiple myeloma and abdominal perforation
 with respiratory failure, now intubated with desaturation and decreased left
 lung sounds.  Evaluation for endotracheal tube position and other findings
 suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates unchanged position of
 endotracheal tube, right PICC and nasogastric tube since the prior study.  The
 bilateral lower lung opacities appear to have progressed since the prior
 study, consistent with worsening pleural effusions and bibasilar
 consolidations as well as worsening pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bilateral lower lobe opacities likely reflect a
 combination of pleural effusion, bibasilar consolidations and worsening
 pulmonary edema.
