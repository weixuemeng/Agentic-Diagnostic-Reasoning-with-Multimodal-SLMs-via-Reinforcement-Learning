                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myeloma and respiratory failure, fluid
 overload, check endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 22:32.
 
 Portable supine chest film dated ___ at 4:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular dual-lumen large-bore catheter, and endotracheal
 tube are unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Overall, there is improving bilateral
 airspace process with perihilar fullness consistent with improving, but still
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  There is slight improvement in aeration
 in the retrocardiac area, but there is still persistent consolidation likely
 representing compressive atelectasis as there are also likely layering
 bilateral effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.
