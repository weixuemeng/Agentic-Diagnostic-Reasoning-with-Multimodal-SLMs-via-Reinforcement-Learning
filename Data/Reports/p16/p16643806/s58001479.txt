                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 22:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, status post line placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 16:29.
 
 Portable supine chest film dated ___ at 22:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter has been advanced and now has
 at least one of the tips near the proximal right atrium/cavoatrial junction. 
 The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at thoracic inlet. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  There is worsening bilateral airspace disease which may represent
 worsening pulmonary edema or an acute infectious process.  More focal
 consolidation in the retrocardiac region is again seen and could represent a
 component of lower lobe collapse.  There are likely layering effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall the cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
