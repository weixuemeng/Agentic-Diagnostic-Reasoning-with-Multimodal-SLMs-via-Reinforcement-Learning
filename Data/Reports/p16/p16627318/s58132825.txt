                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count one week after liver transplantation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed.  There are lower lung volumes.  The right hemidiaphragm is not
 sharply seen, suggesting substantial volume loss in the lower and possible
 middle lobe with blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
