                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___ as well as an outside CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Multifocal opacities within the right lung show interval improvement,
 particularly peribronchovascular opacities in the right upper lobe. 
 Consolidation within the right lower lobe has also  improved, particularly as
 viewed on the lateral projection.  Small right pleural effusion has slightly
 decreased in size.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear except for a very
 subtle area of opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe, which has
 decreased since the prior radiograph as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly improving predominantly right-sided lung opacities, which
 may be due to provided history of alveolar hemorrhage. Pulmonary infection
 could have a similar radiographic appearance.  Continued followup is
 recommended to document complete resolution.
