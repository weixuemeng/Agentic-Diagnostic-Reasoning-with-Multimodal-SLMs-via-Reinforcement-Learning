                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  HIV, recent hemoptysis, right middle lobe pneumonia, evaluation
 of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right basal and right
 apical parenchymal opacities have substantially increased, they have decreased
 both in extent and severity.  However, the opacities are still visible.  In
 addition, there is a remnant parenchymal opacity in the anterior portions of
 the right lower lobe, better visible on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph.
 
 No new parenchymal opacities.  Known scars at the left lung apex.  Normal size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
