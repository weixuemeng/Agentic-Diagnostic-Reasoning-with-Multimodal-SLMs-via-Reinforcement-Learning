 INDICATION:  History: ___F with n/v and diaphoresis  // eval for pe
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is grossly similar to the prior examination and mildly
 enlarged.  There is bilateral hilar prominence.  An opacity is seen adjacent
 the left heart border, in the left lower lobe, that in the appropriate
 clinical context may represent pneumonia.  There are no specific findings
 suggestive of pulmonary embolus.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity may be consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical context.  No specific evidence for pulmonary embolus.  If there is
 persistent concern, CT of the chest can be obtained for evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If there is persistent concern for pulmonary embolus, CT
 of the chest can be obtained for evaluation.
