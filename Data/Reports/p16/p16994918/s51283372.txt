 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic non-productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 confluent area of reticulation and mild volume loss with cuffed and perhaps
 dilated airways in the left lower lobe, new since the prior examination.  Mild
 reticulation in the right costophrenic sulcus appears unchanged.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are present
 along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal new left basilar opacity in the left lower lobe, of
 uncertain chroncity, with suspected bronchiectasis involving the opacity. 
 Either follow-up radiographs are recommended for surveillance or chest CT
 could be considered depending on the clinical situation to evaluate further.
