                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, overlying bony
 structures somewhat obscure the right apical region.  There may be a small
 residual pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, little overall change.
