                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p GET and possible aspiration  // R/O
 aspiration - vopimted during MAC case and ddesaturated. Intubated and
 suctioned through ETT. Clear fluid only.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest imaging available here now.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size top normal. Lungs are clear.
 A roughly elliptical ___ x 9 mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the medial
 right clavicle is probably at the azygos lobe in an azygos fissure, but
 because it could instead be any right upper lobe scar, recommend conventional
 PA and lateral chest radiograph and an AP lordotic frontal image 2 better
 characterize the finding.
 
 There are no radiographic findings detectable on this study, to suggest early
 pneumonia.
