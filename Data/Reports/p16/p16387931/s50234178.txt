 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle, which could be due
 to pleural thickening versus a trace pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation
 is seen.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is calcified. 
 No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle may be
 due to pleural thickening versus trace pleural effusion.
