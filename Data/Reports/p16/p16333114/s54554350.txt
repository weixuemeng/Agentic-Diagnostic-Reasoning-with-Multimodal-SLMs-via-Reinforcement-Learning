                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness, chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a
 retrocardiac opacity which likely represents atelectasis, but cannot rule out
 pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 
 Indication on the right aspect of the trachea is again seen, possibly related
 to a prominent right thyroid lobe.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity in the left lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis, but cannot
 rule aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
