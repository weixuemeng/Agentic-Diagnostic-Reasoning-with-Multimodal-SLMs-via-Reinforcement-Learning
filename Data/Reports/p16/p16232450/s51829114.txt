                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema is detected.  Retrocardiac opacity on frontal view likely
 represents atelectasis.  Heart size is slightly enlarged but likely
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute findings, but soft tissue thickness makes it difficult to exclude
 mild interstitial abnormality.
