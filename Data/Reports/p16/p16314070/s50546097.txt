                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath, pneumonia, metastatic HCC. 
 Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there appears to be significant progression of patient's
 known widespread intrathoracic metastases compared to the prior chest
 radiograph from ___.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  Extensive
 hilar lymphadenopathy is consistent with patient's known intrathoracic
 metastases.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interval progression of patient's known widespread intrathoracic
 metastases compared to the prior chest radiograph from ___ and
 likely progressed from the prior chest CT from ___.  An underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded by this study.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.
