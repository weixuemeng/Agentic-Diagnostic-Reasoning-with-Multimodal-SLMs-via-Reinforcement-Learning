                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with two fiducial seeds placed.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  There persists a right-sided Port-A-Cath whose tip sits
 in the mid SVC.  There has been interval placement of two fiducial seeds
 projecting over the right lower lobe.  Clips in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen are compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 demonstrate subtle ground-glass opacity in the region of the recently placed
 fiducials.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right basilar
 scarring persists.
