                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with volume overload and vascular
 congestion, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 5:36.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall, there has been no significant interval change.  Lung volumes
 remain markedly diminished.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, which may reflect
 atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered.  At the right base,
 there is also concern for an elevated diaphragm in this patient at risk for
 diaphragmatic rupture.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is crowding of
 the vasculature and layering right effusion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  As the right heart border is obscured, it is difficult to
 assess for interval changes in the cardiac and mediastinal contours given
 differences in patient positioning.
