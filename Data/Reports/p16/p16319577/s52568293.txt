                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
 atelectasis at the bases, slightly more prominent on the left.  There is some
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels in the right, mid and lower lung, which
 could reflect some mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  No acute
 focal pneumonia.
