                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate left-sided pleural effusion in patient with breast and
 ovarian cancer, status post thoracentesis with tiny left pneumothorax seen on
 ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a small left
 juxtacardiac pleural effusion with minimal layering component.  The location
 suggests loculation of the effusion.  Previously seen right lower lobe opacity
 has cleared.  There is no pneumothorax.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small left loculated pleural effusion.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Interval clearance of right lower lobe opacity, thought to represent
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
