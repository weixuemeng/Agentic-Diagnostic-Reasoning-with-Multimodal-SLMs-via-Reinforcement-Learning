                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The small right effusion is nearly resolved after thoracentesis. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  The small left effusion may be slightly smaller. 
 There is no consolidation.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 Left retrocardiac opacity has increased.  A right upper lobe granuloma is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No residual right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Increased retrocardiac opacity is most likely atelectasis but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
