                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ PET/CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  The
 heart size is normal.  Opacity within the right medial upper lobe is unchanged
 compared to the PET-CT and there are bilateral diffuse perihilar increased
 interstitial markings correlating with septal thickening seen on CT.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged right upper lobe medial mass likely reflective of metastatic disease
 with evidence of lymphangitic spread of tumor, not significantly changed from
 the previous PET-CT.
