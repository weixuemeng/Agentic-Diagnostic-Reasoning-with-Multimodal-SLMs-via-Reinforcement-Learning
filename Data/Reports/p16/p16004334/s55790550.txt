                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt courses across the right
 side of the chest.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Hazy left basilar opacification has resolved.  There is a
 persistent opacity projecting over the left upper lung that has decreased
 somewhat and may correspond to radiation-related changes, scarring, or
 atelectasis; since it has decreased, infection seems less likely though not
 entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
