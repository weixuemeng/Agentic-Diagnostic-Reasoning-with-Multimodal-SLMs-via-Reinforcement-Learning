                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lightheadedness  // evaluate for vascular
 congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated.  There is at least
 a moderate to large hiatal hernia noted.  Diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted within a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Any electronic device projects
 over the left lung base.  Remote appearing right-sided rib fractures are
 noted.  Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen likely indicate prior
 cholecystectomy.
