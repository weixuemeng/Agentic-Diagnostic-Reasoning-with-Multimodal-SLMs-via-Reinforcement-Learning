  1. Interval increase in moderate pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly and
  small bilateral pleural effusions.
  
  2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with asymmetric
  pulmonary edema however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia, tachypnea.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, tachypnea.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  New cephalization of vasculature with septal thickening, mild
 cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions is most consistent with
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity noted.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Metallic
 anchors at the right humeral head are consistent with prior rotator cuff
 repair.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in moderate pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly and
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
