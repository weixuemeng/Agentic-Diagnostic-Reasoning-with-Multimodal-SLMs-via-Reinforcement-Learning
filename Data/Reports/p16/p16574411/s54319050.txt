                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable, including tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  The posterior costophrenic sulcus on the left is
 obscured, which suggests a small pleural effusion and patchy associated
 opacity in the adjacent parenchyma, which is most commonly due to atelectasis.
 A metallic stent and surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant. 
 Suture anchors are present in the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right posterior basilar density suggesting a possible pleural
 effusion with patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
