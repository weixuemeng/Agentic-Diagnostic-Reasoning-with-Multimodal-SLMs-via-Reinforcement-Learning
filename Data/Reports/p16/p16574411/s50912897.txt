                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta appears unchanged.  It is
 difficult to exclude trace persistent pleural effusions noting blunting of
 posterior costophrenic sulci.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral posterior
 lower lobe opacities have improved substantially including right infrahilar
 opacification.  Suture anchors are present in the right humeral head.  Severe
 degenerative changes are incompletely characterized along the right
 glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improving basilar opacities.
