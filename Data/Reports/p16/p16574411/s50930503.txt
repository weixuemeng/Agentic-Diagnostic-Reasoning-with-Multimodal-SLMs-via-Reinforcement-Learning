                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with a CHF
 exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  The patient is
 rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions are likely
 unchanged, perhaps slightly worse on the left.  No definite new focal
 consolidation is identified, although the right lower lobe opacity previously
 noted would be obscured by the patient's current positioning.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is remarkable for a stent projecting over the right upper
 quadrant, unchanged compared to prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent mild pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusions are
 similar to slightly increased on the left.
 2. No definite new focal consolidation, although patient rotation makes
 evaluation, including of the previously noted right lower lobe opacity,
 difficult.
