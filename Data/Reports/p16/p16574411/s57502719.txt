 There are scattered nodular parenchymal opacities throughout the right mid and
 upper lung with associated right paratracheal and hilar soft tissue consistent
 with known metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy.  There is a right pleural
 effusion which has somewhat increased in size.  Patchy opacity at the right
 base could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  The left lung remains grossly clear.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Sutures overlying the right humeral head and right upper
 quadrant biliary stent are again seen.  Prominent splenic arterial
 calcifications.
