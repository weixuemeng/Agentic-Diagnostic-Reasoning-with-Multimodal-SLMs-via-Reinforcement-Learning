                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of pneumomediastinum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___, CT
 torso ___ at 9:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains borderline enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous
 with unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours.  Previously demonstrated
 pneumomediastinum on the CT from ___ appears almost completely
 resolved on the current radiograph.  Ill-defined nodular opacities within the
 right upper lobe and both lung bases appear relatively unchanged, compatible
 with metastatic disease.  More focal opacity in the right lung base may
 reflect an area of infection.  A small right pleural effusion appears
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Metallic stent is seen within the
 common bile duct with multiple clips demonstrated in the right mid abdomen. 
 Extensive vascular calcifications are also seen within the upper abdomen. 
 Surgical anchors project over the right humeral head which appears chronically
 subluxed with associated degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete interval resolution of previously seen pneumomediastinum. 
 Persistent pulmonary metastases and right lower lobe opacity concerning for
 pneumonia.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
