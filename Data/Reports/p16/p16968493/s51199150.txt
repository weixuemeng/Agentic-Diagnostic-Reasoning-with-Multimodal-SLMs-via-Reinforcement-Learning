                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right ventricular pacer lead revision in
 need of placement confirmation.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again appreciated projects over the left upper chest with leads in
 the right atrium and the right ventricular lead now sits in a more anterior
 position compared to prior study.  Otherwise, the heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and
 hyperlucent, and the hemidiaphragms are flattenend, raising the likelihood of
 COPD.  Small bilateral blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 represents either pleural effusions or pleural scarring.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The bones demonstrate healed posterolateral rib fractures in
 the right upper thorax and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post right ventricular pacer lead revision as described
 above; COPD and small pleural effusions.
