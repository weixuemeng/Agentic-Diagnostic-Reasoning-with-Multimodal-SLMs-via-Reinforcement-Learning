 Calcification within the medial aspect of the right upper lung field likely
 reflects a calcified granuloma.  There is minimal atelectasis at the lung
 bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are present.
