                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker leads, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of
 right atrial and right ventricular lead without evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 change in the mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with coarse
 interstitial markings that could reflect some combination of chronic lung
 disease and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
