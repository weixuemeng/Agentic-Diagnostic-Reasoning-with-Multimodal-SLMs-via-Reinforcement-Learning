                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall now with rib rib pain  // r/o right rib
 fractures, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker and leads are in appropriate position. Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are hyperinflated without focal
 consolidation. Streaky opacities at both lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis. The bronchial tree is calcified and there is mild dilatation of
 the bronchi particularly in the lung bases suggestive of bronchiectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Deformity of the right-sided ribs
 likely reflect remote rib fractures. No acutely displaced fractures seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No acutely displaced fractures identified.
