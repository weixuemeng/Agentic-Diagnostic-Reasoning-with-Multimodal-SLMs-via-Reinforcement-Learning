                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Heart block.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Medial
 bilateral lung base opacities may be due to aspiration, although underlying
 infection not excluded.  There is a possible calcified right diaphragmatic
 plaque.  The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Multiple old right sided rib
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Medial bilateral lung base opacities may be due to aspiration, although
 underlying infection not excluded.
 2.  Questionable trace pleural effusions may be further evaluated with a
 lateral view.
