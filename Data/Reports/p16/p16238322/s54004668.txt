 position      ETT position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is an placement of
 an endotracheal tube the with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube coils within the fundus of the stomach.  There are lower lung
 volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings.  Nevertheless, there is
 increase in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion, especially centrally
 in this patient with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
