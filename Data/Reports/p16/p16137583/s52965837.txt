                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with sarcoidosis history.  Evaluate
 for acute infiltrates.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size is borderline but has not
 increased in comparison with the previous study.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is noted.  The thoracic aorta is significantly widened and
 elongated, marked in the area of the arch.  No new contour abnormalities have
 developed, and no walled calcifications are seen.  The on previous examination
 identified rather extensive peritracheal and mediastinal sizable lymph node
 calcifications are again seen and appear completely unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates, and no evidence of new pleural
 effusions.  Also, the frontal view does not indicate any pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in patient with history of sarcoidosis. 
 Rather typical extensive prominent peritracheal and peribronchial
 calcifications are seen and are unchanged.  No evidence of new acute pulmonary
 abnormalities.
