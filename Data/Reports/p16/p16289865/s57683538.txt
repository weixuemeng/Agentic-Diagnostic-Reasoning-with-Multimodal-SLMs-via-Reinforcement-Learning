                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again diffuse
 interstitial prominence throughout both lungs, consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal,
 accentuated by the low lung volumes.  It is difficult to detect any definite
 superimposed pulmonary edema.
