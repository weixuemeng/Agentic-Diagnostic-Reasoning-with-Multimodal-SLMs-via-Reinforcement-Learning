                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever altered mental status; r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain chest radiograph dated ___. Correlation made to
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The post pneumonectomy appearance of the right hemithorax is unchanged.
 Airspace opacities at the left base may be due to infection, but it is
 difficult to discern how much of the left basilar opacification is actually
 due to layering pleural effusion. There is no left pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be accurately assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar airspace disease may be due to pneumonia, but malignancy is
 difficult to exclude. PA and lateral radiograph may be obtained to assess how
 much of the left basilar abnormality is due to increasing pleural fluid vs
 parenchymal disease.
