 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The overall configuration of the chest is similar to prior film.  The right

 there is an old fracture of the right distal clavicle with cranial apex
 angulation.  There are apparent old right-sided rib fractures as well.  
 
 There is probable mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild upper zone
 re-distribution, without overt CHF, possibly slightly more pronounced than on
 the earlier film.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is
 unchanged.  Possible minimal atelectasis at the left lung base medially.  No
 frank consolidation or left-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal vascular plethora.  No overt CHF or focal
 consolidation detected.
