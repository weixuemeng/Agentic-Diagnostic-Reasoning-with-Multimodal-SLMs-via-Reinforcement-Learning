                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cirrhosis, ascites, decreased
 breath sounds at right lung base.  Evaluate for right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's physical condition required examination in sitting,
 semi-upright position using AP frontal and chest and left lateral views. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and within
 normal limits.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Similar as on the preceding portable chest examination, there is evidence of
 old right-sided chest trauma with right lateral clavicular fracture and
 multiple deformities in the right chest wall.  This coincides with a marked
 elevation of the right-sided diaphragm.  There is no evidence of new acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  On the present lateral view, the
 right-sided diaphragmatic elevation is seen without evidence of pleural
 effusion accumulating in the posterior compartment.  The lateral view is
 compared with a more remote chest examination of ___.  The
 findings are rather unaltered.  Review of our older radiographic records
 demonstrate an examination of ___ on which extensive right-sided
 chest wall and clavicular injuries were described and acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates were noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable-appearing right-sided diaphragmatic elevation related to
 old trauma.  Thus, no evidence of acute pleural effusion.  Should attempt for
 thoracocentesis be made, decubitus films should be obtained to ascertain
 presence of fluid.
