                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and recent hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is substantial subcutaneous emphysema involving the lateral
 and posterior portions of the chest with a minimal amount tracking anteriorly.
 There are post-traumatic changes that are not well characterized involving
 right-sided ribs as well as a prior fracture of the right clavicle.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is moderate to severely elevated.  The lateral view shows that
 there is substantial opacification of the right lower lobe with volume loss
 suggesting collapse or extensive atelectasis and probably a persistent pleural
 effusion.  The left lung is clear without evidence for pleural effusion. 
 Despite the presence of subcutaneous air, there is no definitive evidence for
 pneumothorax, although two small locules of gas projecting over the right
 upper lung field may potentially be intrapleural or project from elsewhere in
 overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subcutaneous emphysema.  Widespread opacification of the right
 lower lobe with volume loss suggesting collapse or substantial atelectasis
 with a suspected pleural effusion.  Suspected post-traumatic changes among
 right ribs and right clavicle.
