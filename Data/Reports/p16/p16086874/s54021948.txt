                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weeping umbilical hernia, pre-op.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to CT abdomen
 from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.  There has been
 interval resolution of subcutaneous gas overlying the right chest wall.  There
 is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which could be due to
 combination of ascitic fluid below the diaphragm and possible component of
 subpulmonic effusion as well.  The lungs themselves are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Post-traumatic changes
 are seen involving multiple anterior right ribs and the lateral right
 clavicle.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.  No free air is seen below
 the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated right hemidiaphragm thought to represent some
 combination of subdiaphragmatic ascitic fluid and possible pleural effusion,
 similar to prior.  No other superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
