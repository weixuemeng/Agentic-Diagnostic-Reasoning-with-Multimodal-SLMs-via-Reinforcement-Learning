                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with oxygen saturation of 60%.  The patient has
 been vomiting after Narcan which was administered for unresponsiveness. 
 Assess for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications could represent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, though the
 possibility of widespread pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
