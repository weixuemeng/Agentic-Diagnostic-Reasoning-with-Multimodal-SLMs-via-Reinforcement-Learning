                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or acute, displaced right rib
 fracture on this chest radiograph examination.  Heart size is normal.  Lungs
 are overinflated but grossly clear.  There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No chest radiographic evidence of pneumothorax or acute, displaced rib
 fracture.  If localizing symptoms persist, consider dedicated rib radiograph
 with metallic marker placement.
 
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs, suggesting the possibility of COPD.
