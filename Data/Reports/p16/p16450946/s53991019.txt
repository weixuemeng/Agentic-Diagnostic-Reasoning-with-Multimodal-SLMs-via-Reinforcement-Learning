                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, intermittent for 2 days.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 mild tortuosity of the descending aorta.  There is redemonstration of
 bibasilar linear opacities which most likely represent atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, lungs are well expanded. There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is redemonstration of
 a calcified left upper lung granuloma.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar linear opacities most likely represent atelectasis or
 scarring, unchanged from prior.
