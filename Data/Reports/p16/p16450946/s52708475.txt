                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath today, now
 resolved.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Right upper lobe scarring is seen,
 unchanged from prior exam.  Nipple shadows are noted bilaterally.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen, which likely represent atelectasis or scarring but cannot
 completely exclude infectious etiology.  A left upper lung calcified granuloma
 is again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis or scarring but
 cannot completely exclude infectious etiology.
