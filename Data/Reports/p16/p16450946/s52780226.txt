                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain X 2 days  // ? acute cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Severe
 emphysema with upper lobe predominance is again noted.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, however infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view may
 reflect chronic pleural thickening.  No large pneumothorax is identified. 
 Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe emphysema.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
