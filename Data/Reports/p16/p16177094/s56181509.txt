                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with pleuritic chest pain  // eval heart and lungs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. The lungs are hyperinflated with a hyperlucent appearance
 compatible with known COPD. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe may
 reflect pneumonia versus atelectasis. No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. There may be a tiny left pleural effusion given blunting on lateral
 projection. Mediastinal contour stable. Aortic atherosclerotic calcification
 noted. Imaged bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly, subtle left lower lobe opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia. Possible tiny left pleural effusion.
