 Opacities in the left lower lobe have markedly improved, consistent with
 improving atelectasis.  There are remaining opacities in the lower lobes
 bilaterally consistent with atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
