                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Streaky opacities at the left lung base are unchanged from prior
 studies, compatible with scarring. Minimal linear opacification at the right
 lung base adjacent to but not obscuring the right heart border likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is identified. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is
 midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  S-shaped
 thoracolumbar scoliosis is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Unchanged left basilar scarring; new right basilar linear opacities, most
 compatible with atelectasis.
