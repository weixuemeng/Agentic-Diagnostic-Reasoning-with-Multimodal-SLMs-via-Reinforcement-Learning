                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a bowel obstruction.  Evaluate OG tube
 position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 17:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
 been interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the body of the
 stomach.  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.
 
 Ill-defined opacity at the right lung base has significantly progressed, and
 concerning for aspiration.  There may also be an opacity at the left lung
 base.  Remainder of the lungs are otherwise clear.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 There has been interval decompression of the stomach since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the body of the
 stomach.
 2. Worsening right lung base opacity, concerning for aspiration.
 3. Small right pleural effusion.
