                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  L2 fracture, back brace, decreased basilar breath sounds,
 question basilar atelectasis?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  Thoracic aorta mildly elongated, but no
 local contour abnormalities or wall calcifications are seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  The diaphragms are in relatively high position
 resulting in some mildly crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on
 the bases.  Thin linear densities are seen bilaterally suggesting the presence
 of scar formations rather than atelectasis.  Similar as shown on previous
 examination, there is evidence of old rib fractures on the right base
 laterally with local pleural thickenings.  No new abnormalities are
 identified.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions as the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  On the lateral view, the structures of
 the upper abdomen are underpenetrated, but with change in mixed density, one
 can appreciate a significant compression fracture of L2.  It is noted that
 lumbar spine examination was ordered and performed during the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiac enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  Mild deformities
 of right-sided ribs related to old trauma.  No new acute abnormalities.  Thin
 basal scar formations but no true major atelectasis is seen.
