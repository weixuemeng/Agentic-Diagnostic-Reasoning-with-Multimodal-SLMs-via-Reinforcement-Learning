                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent abdominal surgery with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
 pain.  Assess for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, seen
 to end within the stomach on accompanying radiographs from ___. 
 There is minimal linear left lower lung atelectasis.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles could indicate trace
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  No free air is seen under the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with subsegmental left lower lung atelectasis.
 
 2.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
