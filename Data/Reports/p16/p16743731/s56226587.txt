                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:55 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 On ___, though lung volumes were low, and there were moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, the upper lungs were clear.  Upper lobe vascular
 congestion, greater left lower lobe consolidation and probable increase in
 some small left pleural effusion developed by 7:00 p.m. on ___.  Now
 there has been a substantial increase in moderate left pleural effusion, and
 the persistence of left lower lobe consolidation is either atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Dilatation of mediastinal veins and upper lobe pulmonary
 vasculature is an indication of biventricular cardiac decompensation but all
 of these findings are exaggerated by exceedingly low lung volumes.  Upper
 enteric tube ends in the mid stomach.  No other cardiopulmonary support
 devices are identified.
