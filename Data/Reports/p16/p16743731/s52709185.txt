 previous examination, is no longer visible.  The internal jugular vein
 catheter is seen in unchanged position.  The known effusion on the left is
 layering along the left lateral chest wall.  Its extent has increased and
 causes atelectatic changes in the left lung.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged appearance of the right hemithorax.
