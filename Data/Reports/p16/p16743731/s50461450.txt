 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cirrhosis, sepsis, volume overload, now extubated,
 out of ICU febrile at 101, new process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient has been extubated since prior exam.  Left jugular line remains in
 adequate position in the upper SVC.  The stomach is more distended since prior
 exam and left lower lobe consolidation and moderate pleural effusion have
 worsened; this is worrisome for aspiration.  Right basal atelectasis is
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The stomach is more distended and left lower lobe consolidation and
 pleural effusion have worsened.  This is worrisome for aspiration.
 2.  The patient has been extubated.
