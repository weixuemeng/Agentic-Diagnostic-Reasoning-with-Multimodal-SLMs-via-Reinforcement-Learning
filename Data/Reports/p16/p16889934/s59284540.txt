 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Diagnosis of pneumonia with worsening symptoms despite
 antibiotics, question interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There has
 been interval worsening in diffuse airspace opacity as compared with the prior
 radiograph from ___, which is compatible with interval progression of
 pneumonia, possibly with superimposed edema.  Several nodules, better assessed
 on prior CT are once again seen.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  Bony
 structures appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression in pulmonary opacity concerning for
 progression of pneumonia with possible superimposed edema.  Bilateral
 pulmonary nodules, better assessed on prior exam.
