                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with melanoma, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains
 unchanged and is within normal limits.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic
 aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  Again identified is a nodular round density
 superimposing the right hilar structures on the frontal view.  The lateral
 view localizes this pulmonary mass into the anterior segment of the right
 upper lobe.  The previously present left subclavian approach central venous
 line has been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax and no new
 suspicious pulmonary parenchymal densities or masses can be identified.  It is
 noted that the patient has undergone sequential CT torso examinations with the
 latest CT examination dated ___.  Although size determination based
 on chest x-ray cannot be easily compared with CT findings, comparison of the
 coronal view of the chest CT of ___ suggests stable size or only minor
 progression.  It can also be stated that a mass lesion directly within the
 hilum has not resulted in any marked progression.  There is, however, a small
 prominent right-sided contour in the superior mediastinum at the level of the
 aortic arch.  This contour is directly located over the right tracheobronchial
 angle.  Evaluation of these possible minor changes would, however, require a
 repeat followup CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right-sided mass identified.  Possible beginning new mass
 in superior mediastinum.  No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates,
 cardiac enlargement or vascular congestion.
