                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fatigue, urinary retention, and a history of melanoma.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there are multiple rounded masses throughout the bilateral
 lungs, consistent with metastases.  The largest is in the right hilum. 
 Allowing for changes in technique, these appear grossly similar to the prior
 CT from ___.  There is no new focal airspace opacity to suggest
 pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Grossly unchanged widespread pulmonary metastases from the known
 metastatic melanoma.
