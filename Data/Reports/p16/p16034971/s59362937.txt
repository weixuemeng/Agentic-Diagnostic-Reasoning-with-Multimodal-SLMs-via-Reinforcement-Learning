                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncopal episode.  Assess for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is volume
 loss in the right lung with right apical pleural thickening and extensive
 pleural calcification.  Findings are likely chronic.  There is minimal left
 apical pleuroparenchymal scarring with calcification.  There is no focal
 consolidation in the left lung.  The heart size appears within normal limits. 
 The aorta is somewhat unfolded.  Bony structures appear demineralized though
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable chronic volume loss with scarring and pleural
 calcification in the right lung.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
