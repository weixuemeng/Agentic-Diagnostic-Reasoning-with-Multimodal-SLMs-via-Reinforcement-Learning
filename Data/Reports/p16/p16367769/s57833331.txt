                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Assess ET tube and OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the clavicles,
 6.8 cm above the carina.  There is a feeding tube whose distal side port is at
 the GE junction.  This could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. 
 There is some atelectasis and developing infiltrate at the right base with
 likely a right-sided pleural effusion.  There are no signs of overt pulmonary
 edema or focal pneumothoraces.
