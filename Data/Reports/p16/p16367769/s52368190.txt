                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NFCLC with brain metastasis status post G-tube placement, admitted
 for recurrent coffee-ground emesis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning, with low inspiratory volumes.  A right IJ line is present
 -- the tip likely overlies the distalmost SVC. 
 
 The cardiac contour is prominent, but likely accentuated by low inspiratory
 volumes and therefore not clearly enlarged.  There is hazy opacity over both
 lungs suggesting layering effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation at both lung bases.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No obvious
 free air beneath the diaphragm, but subtle air might be obscured due to beam
 angulation.  Tubing is seen over the upper abdomen in the midline, not fully
 characterized.  Rounded lucency over the axilla is noted -- ? artifact or less
 likely subcutaneous emphysema. 
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:13 a.m. and allowing for differences in
 positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely stable.  The effusions
 and underlying collapse/consolidation are more pronounced.
