                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Line placement, pulling back.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right central venous
 access line has been pulled back.  Currently, the tip still projects over the
 right atrium.  Ensure position in the mid-to-lower SVC, further pulled back by
 about 4 cm is required.
 
 Unchanged size and shape of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  Unchanged likely small left pleural effusion.
