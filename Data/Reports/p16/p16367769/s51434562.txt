                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:14 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic small cell carcinoma.  Likely aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 8:01 a.m.:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 and loss of volume in the right lung indicating lower lobe atelectasis are
 both unchanged.  ET tube, right internal jugular line are in standard
 placements.  Nasogastric tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction and should
 be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.  Poor
 definition of the right bronchus suggests retained secretions are responsible
 for loss of volume in the right lung.
