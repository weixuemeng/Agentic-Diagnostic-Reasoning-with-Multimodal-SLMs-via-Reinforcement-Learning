                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of lung adenocarcinoma and aspiration
 pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates consolidation
 in the right lung base is unchanged.  There is a similar amount of fluid seen
 layering along the minor fissure, which is chronically elevated from right
 upper lobe radiation change.  There is no pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal in appearance.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size, the mediastinal contours remain widened, with loss of the paratracheal
 stripe, likely the result of prominent mediastinal fat.
 
 The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies 5.5 cm from
 the level of the carina.  A right IJ line is in place, unchanged in position
 with its tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  NG tube is in place,
 the tip is not seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged dense right basilar consolidation, with a small amount
 of fluid seen in the minor fissure.  No pulmonary edema.
