                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Blunt injury to chest wall and chest pain.  Question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 well expanded and clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous injury identified.  However if concern for rib
 fracture, a dedicated rib series should be considered.
