 INDICATION:  Recent PICC line, now with pain, please evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest PA and lateral radiographs were obtained. Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 There is a right-sided PICC line with tip apparent in the mid right subclavian
 vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line with tip in the mid right subclavian vein. 
 Per last imaging, tip was positioned in the distal superior vena cava and this
 thus represents a change.  No record of interval intentional draw back of
 PICC.
