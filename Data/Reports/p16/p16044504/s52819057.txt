 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm could be due to subpulmonic effusion.  There is also
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  The left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated right hemidiaphragm which is nonspecific but could be
 due to subpulmonic effusion.
