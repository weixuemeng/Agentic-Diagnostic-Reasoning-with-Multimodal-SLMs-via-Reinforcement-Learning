                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemic resp failure, intubated  //
 assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, lines and tubes are similar in
 appearance.  Again noted is the pigtail-type catheter at the right lung base. 
 A prominent gastric air bubble is also again noted.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Although the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly more pronounced,
 this may be relate to differences in positioning.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, similar to the prior study.
 
 Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with suspected
 small left effusion.   Small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. 
 Patchy opacity at the right base is again noted.  Possible minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, but no obvious right pleural effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearance is probably similar.  No gross right effusion. No
 pneumothorax detected.
