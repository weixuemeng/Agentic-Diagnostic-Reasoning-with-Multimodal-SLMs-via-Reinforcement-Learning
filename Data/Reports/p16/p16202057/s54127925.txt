                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Chest tube placement  // r/o R PTC
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, a right-sided pigtail catheter is now seen
 at the base of the right lung.
 
 No gross right-sided effusion is identified -- the previously suspected
 effusion is significantly decreased in size.  No obvious right pneumothorax is
 detected.  Minimal linear atelectasis at the right base is now visible,
 without other evidence of right base consolidation.
 
 On the left, the small effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 remains present.  Some platelike atelectasis at the junction of the left
 middle lower zones is new.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is either stable or slightly decreased in size, allowing for
 significant differences in degree of the patient rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right lung base pigtail catheter, with considerable
 improvement in the right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 Persistent left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  New
 platelike atelectasis in the lower left lung.
