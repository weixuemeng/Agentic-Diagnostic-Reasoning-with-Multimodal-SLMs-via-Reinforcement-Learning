                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure, cirrhosis,
 secondary SBP from prior right colectomy with microperforation.  // evaluate
 for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:31
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Rotated positioning.  A  tube is seen immediately to the left of midline at
 the level of the trachea.  However, given patient rotation, it is difficult to
 confirm that this represents an ET tube.  The tip lies at the inferior edge of
 the clavicular heads.   Clinical correlation is requested.
 
 An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off the film.  Right IJ
 central line tip overlies the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably similar.  Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular plethora.  Hazy opacity at the lung bases suggests the presence of
 bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Allowing
 for differences in positioning, the left pleural effusion appears smaller. 
 Otherwise, the appearance at both bases is probably similar.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Comparison is limited due to differences in positioning, in particular due
 to the patient rotation.  If desired, a repeat AP view be obtained at no
 additional charge to the the patient to facilitate direct comparison.
 2.  ?  ET tube.  Please see comment above.
 3.  Interval improvement in left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, allowing for
 differences in positioning, I doubt significant change at the lung bases, with
 continued effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 4.  CHF with vascular plethora, possibly very slightly improved.
