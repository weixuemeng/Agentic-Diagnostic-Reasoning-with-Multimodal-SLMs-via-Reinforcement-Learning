                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with mild hypoxia on room air, evaluate lung
 parenchyma.
 
 COMPARISON:   CXR of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained.  Heart is normal size
 and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable except for tortuousity of
 thoracic aorta.  Since the examination of ___ the pulmonary vascular
 congestion that was noted has improved.  However, there is new increased
 opacity in the left retrocardiac region that is consistent with atelectasis
 and/or consolidation.  Minimal right basilar atelectasis is slightly
 increased. Remainder of right lung is clear.  A 9-mm left upper lobe
 ground-glass nodule seen on the previous CT cannot be appreciated on a
 radiograph.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 New left basilar opacity consistent with atelectasis or consolidation; slight
 increase in mild right basilar atelectasis.  Previously seen pulmonary
 vascular congestion has improved.
