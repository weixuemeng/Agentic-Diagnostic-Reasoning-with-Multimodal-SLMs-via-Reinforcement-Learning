  New focal opacity projecting over the right hilum, likely within the anterior
  aspect of the right upper lobe potentially due to pneumonia, but further
  assessment with contrast-enhanced CT is suggested to exclude a more central or
  right hilar mass.

 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 3:17 PM
  
  
  1. Increased enlargement of the right hilum may be due to underlying
  lymphadenopathy or mass lesion and further assessment with contrast-enhanced
  CT is suggested.
  2. Bilateral calcified hilar nodes are compatible with prior granulomatous
  disease.
  3. No evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is tortuous with minimal
 atherosclerotic calcifications. An ill-defined focal opacity is noted
 projecting over the right hilum, new in the interval, which appears to be
 localized anteriorly within the right upper lobe on the lateral view.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation
 of the pulmonary markings towards the upper lobes suggestive of underlying
 emphysema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New focal opacity projecting over the right hilum, likely within the anterior
 aspect of the right upper lobe potentially due to pneumonia, but further
 assessment with contrast-enhanced CT is suggested to exclude a more central or
 right hilar mass.
