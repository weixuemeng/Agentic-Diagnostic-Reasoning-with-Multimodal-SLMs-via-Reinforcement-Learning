                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAP but persistent O2 requirement and now
 increasing leukocytosis. Parapneumonic effusion, abscess?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval worsening in the
 consolidation of the lower portion of the right upper lobe, of which the minor
 fissure is the lower border. This is consistent with pneumonia. The right
 heart border is obscured. There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles with right greater than left pleural effusions. There is no
 pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval worsening of the radiographic appearance of the right upper lobe
 pneumonia, without evidence of abscess.
 
 2. Significant right greater than left pleural effusions.
