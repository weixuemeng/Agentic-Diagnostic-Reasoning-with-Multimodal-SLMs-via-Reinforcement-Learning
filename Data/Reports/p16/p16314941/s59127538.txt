                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Minimal streaky left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal streaky opacity in the left lower lobe, most likely reflective of
 atelectasis, but an area of infection cannot be completely excluded.
