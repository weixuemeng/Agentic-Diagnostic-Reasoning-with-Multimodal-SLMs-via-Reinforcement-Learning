                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement, patient with subarachnoid
 hemorrhage.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was provided.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube resides 2.2 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the left upper abdomen.  Extensive pulmonary ground-glass
 opacities are concerning for pulmonary edema, likely neurogenic cause.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly unremarkable.  No bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned ET tube and NG tube.  Severe pulmonary
 edema.
