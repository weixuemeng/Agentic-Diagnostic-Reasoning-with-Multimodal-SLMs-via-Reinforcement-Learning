                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with abd pain, evaluate for free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal portable semi-upright view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Allowing for this, airspace opacities in the right lung base and retrocardiac
 region may represent atelectasis or early consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  No evidence for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities may represent atelectasis or early
 consolidation, depending upon the clinical setting.
 3. No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
