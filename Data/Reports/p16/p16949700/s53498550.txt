                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New ICD device placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is interval placement of the pacemaker defibrillator with its leads
 terminating in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle.   
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
  The patient most likely has had CABG, and  the lack of the sternal wires
 might suggest prior sternectomy or removal of the wires.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
