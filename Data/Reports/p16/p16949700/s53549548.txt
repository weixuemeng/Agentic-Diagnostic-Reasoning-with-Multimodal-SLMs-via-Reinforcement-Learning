                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, now status post PEA arrest. 
 Rule out worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.
 
 None of the available views include the lung bases.  Allowing for this, an ET
 tube is present, tip approximately 7.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending along the length of the visible mediastinum.  A right
 IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  A left-sided dual-lead
 pacemaker is present, lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 Scattered mediastinal clips are present.  There is cardiomegaly, similar,
 possibly slightly improved compared with ___ at 18:56 p.m.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse
 vascular blurring, with crowding of vessels in the right cardiophrenic region,
 quite similar to the prior film.  Assessment for small effusions is limited,
 but no gross effusion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited assessment of lung bases.
 
 2.  Upper zone redistribution and evidence for interstitial edema.
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and probable element of
 consolidation at the right base medially.
 
 4.  Cardiomegaly, possibly slightly improved.
 
 5.  Otherwise, appearance is similar to one day earlier.  Possibility of early
 alveolar edema cannot be excluded.
