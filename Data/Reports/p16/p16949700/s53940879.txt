  Moderate pulmonary edema; concomitant infection is not excluded.  1.8 cm
  nodular opacity in the left retrocardiac region could be a pulmonary nodule or
  calcified pleural plaque.  Curvilinear radiodensity along the right
  hemidiaphragm could be calcified pleural plaque.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload and shortness of breath.  Assess for evidence of
 CHF or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema; concurrent
 pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe, is not excluded.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged, increased in size compared to the prior radiograph
 from ___.  A 1.8 x 1.4 cm nodular opacity projecting over the left
 retrocardiac region just medial to two surgical clips could be a pulmonary
 nodule or pleural calcification.  A curvilinear radiodense structure
 paralleling the right hemidiaphragm may also be pleural calcification.  There
 are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema. Concurrent pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 2.  ___-mm nodular opacity projecting over the left retrocardiac region could
 be a pulmonary nodule or pleural calcification.  Curvilinear radiodensity
 projecting over the right hemidiaphragm may also be pleural calcification.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly, increased compared to the prior study from ___.
