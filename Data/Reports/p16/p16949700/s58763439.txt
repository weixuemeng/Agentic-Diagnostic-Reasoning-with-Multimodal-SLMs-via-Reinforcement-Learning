                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubation  // eval for tube, line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in the
 supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___ at 10:20 AM, ___
 at 07:___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube which terminates
 approximately 7.4 cm above the carina, with distal tip of the tube at the
 inferior edge of the medial clavicular heads. There has also been interval
 placement of a nasogastric tube which appears to terminate below the level of
 the diaphragm and outside the view of this radiograph. Of note, the inferior
 edge of this film probably lies in the region of the GE junction.
 
 Otherwise, no gross interval change is detected compared with the chest
 radiograph performed 30 minutes earlier. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with
 pulmonary edema. There has probably been slight improvement in the appearance
 of the right upper lobe. Possible slight improvement in the degree of
 interstitial edema in the left upper lobe. Left-sided pacemaker device again
 noted, with 2 leads in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube, detailed above.
 Possible slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema findings, but the
 overall appearance is quite similar.
