                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds and increasing shortness of breath.  Rule
 out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and infrahilar consolidation, most likely
 atelectasis, one day following laparotomy, reflected in the pneumoperitoneum
 collected beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  Increased mild cardiomegaly and
 mediastinal vascular engorgement suggest volume resuscitation.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
