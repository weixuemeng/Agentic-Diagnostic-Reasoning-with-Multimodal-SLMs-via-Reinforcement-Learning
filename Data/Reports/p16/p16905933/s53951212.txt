                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation // ET tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.7 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip terminates within the stomach.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with moderate emphysematous changes noted
 in the upper lobes.  Within the left mid lung field is a 7.6 x 9.6 cm mass,
 new from the previous study.  Remainder of the lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. 9.6 cm left mid lung field mass concerning for malignancy.  CT of the chest
 with contrast is recommended for further assessment.
 3. Upper lobe predominant moderate emphysema.
