                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multivessel CAD and Left lung PNA  // eval
 for infiltrate/ progression of PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   No prior imaging for comparison
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse airspace opacities are noted throughout the left lung, with greater
 involvement of the left upper lobe within the lingula and left lower lobe.  
 Additionally, there are focal patchy opacities in the right apical lung and
 right lung base concerning for bialteral pneumonia.  A loculated
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion are
 present.  The heart is enlarged.  Degenerative thoracic spine disease is also
 seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse left lung airspace opacification is consistent with history of left
 lung pneumonia.  Moderate loculated left pleural effusion raises concern for
 complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema.  Additional patchy opacities in
 right lung are likely secondary to pneumonia as well.
 2. Recommend follow-up chest radiograph in ___ weeks to document resolution
 after antibiotic therapy.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Follow-up chest radiograph in 6 8 weeks after antibiotic
 therapy.
