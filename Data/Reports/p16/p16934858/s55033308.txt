                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is a new interstitial opacity,
 predominantly involving the right, mid and lower lung zones.  There is mild
 vascular congestion and some Kerley B lines at the left base, suggestive of
 volume overload.  A small right pleural effusion is stable in size.  A trace
 left pleural effusion appears slightly decreased in size.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Biapical scarring is stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and unchanged.  The patient is
 status post a sternotomy.  Sternal wires are intact.
 
 Again noted is a displaced overriding right humerus fracture, not
 significantly changed from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New opacity in the right mid and lower lung zones, which given the
 asymmetry is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.  In the setting of mild
 pulmonary edema, asymmetric edema is also a consideration.
 2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.  Slight decrease in size of a
 trace left pleural effusion.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Again seen overriding displaced partially imaged right humerus fracture.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:45 p.m. on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
