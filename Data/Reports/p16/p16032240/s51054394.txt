 Portable AP semi-supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in unchanged position.  There
 is bilateral diffuse airspace process which is unchanged and could reflect
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema or diffuse infectious process such as
 aspiration or pneumonia.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax, although the
 ensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given semisupine
 technique.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
