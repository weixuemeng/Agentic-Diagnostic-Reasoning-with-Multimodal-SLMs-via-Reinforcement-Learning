                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to the back.  Evaluate heart size.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low but appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 cardiac silhouette is somewhat enlarged, though exaggerated by low lung
 volumes. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion. Repeat frontal radiograph at full inspiration may modify
 that interpretation. The lungs are clear.
