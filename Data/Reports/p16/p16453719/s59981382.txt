                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with worsening encephalopathy in the past few days. eval for
 cardiopulm change or liver change  // ___F with worsening encephalopathy in the
 past few days. eval for cardiopulm change or liver change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Surgical clips are noted at the left lung apex and there is elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm, suggesting postsurgical volume loss on the left.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is slightly unfolded.
 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate, gross effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is suggested.  A few septal lines
 at the left lung base laterally could represent small amount of chronic
 interstitial scarring.
 
 There is effacement of the left clavicular companion shadow.
 
 Multiple clips noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postsurgical changes the left lung apex, with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 Doubt acute pulmonary process.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 is however noted.  No gross pleural effusion.
 
 Nonvisualization of the left clavicular companion shadow. This could reflect
 surgical changes in this area.  The differential diagnosis includes left
 supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Correlation with physical exam is therefore
 requested.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with physical exam to exclude left
 supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
