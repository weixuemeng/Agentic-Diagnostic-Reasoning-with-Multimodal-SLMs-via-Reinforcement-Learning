                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count, evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Multiple, dense nodules are seen throughout the lungs, the largest
 on the left measuring 1.6 cm and largest on the right measuring 0.7 cm.  There
 is also bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Given the findings on the recent
 head CT, this is worrisome for metastatic disease. Granulomatous disease is
 also considered a possibility given the degree of density in these nodules.  A
 dedicated chest CT would be helpful in further evaluation.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight obscuration of the left
 heart border is likely atelectasis, although, infection is not excluded. 
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 5:42 on ___ by telephone.
