                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, and a
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is noted with tip in the lower SVC.  Consolidative
 opacity within the right lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with lateralization of the diaphragmatic
 peak suggesting a subpulmonic effusion.  The cardiac silhouette size is top
 normal.  There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings.  No
 left-sided pleural effusion is seen, and there is no pneumothorax.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia with probable right subpulmonic
 effusion.
