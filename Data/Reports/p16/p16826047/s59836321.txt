                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position.  There has been
 interval increase in extent of opacification of the right hemithorax,
 compatible with increasing size of a large layering right pleural effusion. 
 Additionally, right basilar atelectasis is noted.  Minimal patchy opacity in
 the left lung base may also reflect atelectasis.  The heart size remains
 moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged.
 Mild element of pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased size of large layering right pleural effusion with right basilar
 atelectasis.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and left basilar
 mild atelectasis.  Right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position.
