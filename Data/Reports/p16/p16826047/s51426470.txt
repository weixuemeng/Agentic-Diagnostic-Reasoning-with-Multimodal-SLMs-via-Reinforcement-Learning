                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recurrent right pleural effusion, status post chest tube and
 pleurodesis.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies performed a day earlier.
 
 Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, large right pleural
 effusion is either stable or minimally increased.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed.  Mild pulmonary edema is new. 
 Port-A-Cath and right pleural catheter are in place.
