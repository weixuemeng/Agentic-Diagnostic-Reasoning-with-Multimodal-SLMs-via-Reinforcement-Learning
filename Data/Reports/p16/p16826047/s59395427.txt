                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with a right Pleurx catheter for
 recurrent exudative effusions with large air leak.  Study requested to rule
 out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, at 4:40.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, right
 Pleurx catheter remains in position and there is still substantial layering of
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the right base.  There
 appears to be interval engorgement of pulmonary vessels, particularly on the
 left.  The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, which could represent a
 small pleural effusion.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged right pleural effusion. Stable cardiomegaly with
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Possible small left pleural effusion.
