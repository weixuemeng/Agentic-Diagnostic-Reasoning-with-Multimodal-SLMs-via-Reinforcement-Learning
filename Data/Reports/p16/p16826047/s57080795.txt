                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusion, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  Large right pleural
 effusion which is loculated appears slightly increased compared to the prior
 study.  Right basilar opacification could reflect compressive atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.  Chest tube is again noted with tip
 projecting over the right lung base.  There is mild leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures, slightly increased compared to the prior study. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours otherwise are unchanged.  Streaky left
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified,
 and no pulmonary edema is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large right loculated pleural effusion, slightly increased in size with
 increasing right basilar opacification suggestive of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.
