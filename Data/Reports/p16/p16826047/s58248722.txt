                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT chest from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  PleurX catheter, history of effusion with worsening
 shortness of breath, assess interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Port-A-Cath is
 unchanged in position with its tip positioned in the expected location of the
 mid SVC.  A right pleural drain is in place with increased opacity in the
 right lung and probable increase in size of the loculated right pleural
 effusion.  Findings are concerning for a superimposed consolidation/pneumonia.
 The left lung remains essentially clear.  The heart is difficult to assess
 given the effacement of the right heart border.  The prominence of the
 mediastinum may reflect in part adjacent loculated pleural fluid.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right pleural loculated effusion with chest tube in
 place.  Increasing consolidation in the right lung is concerning for
 pneumonia.
