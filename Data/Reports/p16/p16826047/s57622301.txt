 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chronic right empyema, PleurX catheter
 with decreased drainage, increasing dyspnea, question interval worsening.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  PleurX catheter is
 again seen on the right with its tip at the level of the right sixth and
 seventh posterior rib interspace.  There is persistent effusion and
 consolidation within the right lung, though there is slight improvement in the
 aeration in the right upper lung as compared with the prior chest radiograph. 
 There is persistent loculated right pleural effusion for which a slight
 increased fluid component is seen along the right lateral upper lung.  The
 left lung is unchanged and clear.  Heart size cannot be assessed due to
 effacement of the right heart border.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent consolidation and loculated right pleural effusion
 with PleurX catheter in unchanged position.
