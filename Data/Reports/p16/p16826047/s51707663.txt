                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is mild decrease in
 the still substantial opacification along the mid and lower lateral chest wall
 on the right, most likely reflecting a loculated effusion.  Apparent pleural
 catheter remains in place, as does the Port-A-Cath.
 
 Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
