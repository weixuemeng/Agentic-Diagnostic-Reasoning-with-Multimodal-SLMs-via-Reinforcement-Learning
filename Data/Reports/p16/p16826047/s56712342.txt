                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain, shock-like in quality.  Does not radiate.
 Lasts for minutes at a time.  Associated with nausea.  Please evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  A moderate right pleural effusion has increased
 compared to the prior study from ___, likely with a subpulmonic
 component.  A concomitant consolidative process at the right lung base cannot
 be excluded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank
 interstitial edema.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right Port-A-Cath ends in the
 mid-to-low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion with a likely subpulmonic component.  A
 concomitant infectious process at the right base cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without interstitial edema.
