                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate chest tube position and residual pneumothorax in the
 patient who developed hypotension after right thoracoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 clearance of the large right pleural effusion with diffuse opacification of
 the right middle and lower lobes, likely secondary to re-expansion
 atelectasis.  There is now a new small left pleural effusion which was not
 present four days ago.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Interval widening of the upper mediastinal silhouette secondary to central
 venous engorgement is suggestive of hypervolemia.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  A right chest wall central venous catheter is appropriately positioned
 in the lower SVC.  The right chest tube is also appropriately positioned, in
 the right lower pleural space, including the side port.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The chest tube is appropriately positioned and there is no pneumothorax.
 2.  Interval clearance of large right pleural effusion with re-expansion
 atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes.
 3.  New small left pleural effusion not present on the prior study.
 4.  Findings suggestive of mild hypervolemia.
