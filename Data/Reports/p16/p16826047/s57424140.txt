                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.  History of CHF.  Assess for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is redemonstration of a right pleural catheter, with its tip
 projecting over the posterior pleural space.  A moderate loculated right
 pleural effusion is slightly increased in size compared to the most recent
 radiograph from ___.  Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid to
 lower lung are slightly increased, possibly partially due to overlying pleural
 fluid, although atelectasis or infection in this region is certainly possible.
 There is borderline pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly is not significantly
 changed.  There is no definite left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is evidence of central adenopathy, increased compared to prior
 radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased moderate right loculated pleural effusion.  Unchanged
 positioning of a right pleural catheter.
 
 2.  Slight increase in right mid to lower lung heterogeneous opacities, likely
 partially due to increased pleural fluid, although atelectasis or infection in
 this region is certainly possible.
 
 3.  Borderline pulmonary edema.
 
 4.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 
 5.  Increased central adenopathy compared to prior radiographs from ___.  Further evaluation could be performed with CT, if clinically
 indicated.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 at 8:58 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
