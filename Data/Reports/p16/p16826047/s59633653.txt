 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with HIV and abdominal distention, abdominal pain. 
 History of pleural catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Right chest wall port is again seen with catheter tip in

 in the  fissure.  Significant amount of right-sided pleural effusion has
 slightly increased since prior with fluid also seen within the major fissure. 
 No pneumothorax seen.  There is underlying parenchymal opacity as well,
 potentially atelectasis; however, infiltrate is also possible.  Left lung is
 grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

 catheter in place.  Expected associated right base atelectasis with
 possibility of infection not excluded.
