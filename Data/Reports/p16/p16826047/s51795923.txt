 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and chronic heart failure, evaluation for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The extensive right pleural effusion is constant in distribution and
 extent.  Also constant are the relatively massive subsequent parenchymal
 opacities in the right hemithorax.  On the left, there is no visible change,
 the appearance of the left heart border, the left costophrenic sinus and the
 structure of the lung parenchyma is constant.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural
 effusions.
