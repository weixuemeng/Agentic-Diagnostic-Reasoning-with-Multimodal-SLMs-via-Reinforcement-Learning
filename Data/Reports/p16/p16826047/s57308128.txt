                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Burkitt's lymphoma, now with pain around
 the right port site.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacity over the right mid-to-lower lateral lung appears similar,
 likely corresponding to known loculated pleural effusion; catheter within the
 effusion appears similarly positioned.  Right Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 low SVC, similar to prior.  No new consolidation, left effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema is detected.  Heart size is persistently enlarged, likely
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable-appearing loculated right pleural effusion with
 corresponding catheter.
