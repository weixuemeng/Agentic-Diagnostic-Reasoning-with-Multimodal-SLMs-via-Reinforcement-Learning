 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Asymptomatic desaturation, question worsening pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The largely fissural right pleural effusion has increased minimally since
 ___.  Accompanying increase in moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal
 vascular caliber suggests a component of early cardiac decompensation may be
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right subclavian infusion port ends in
 the mid SVC.  There is no appreciable left pleural effusion.  The right
 pleural drainage catheter has not migrated since a PET/CT on ___ shows
 it cannulates the right interlobar fissures from which the loculated pleural
 effusion should be accessible.
