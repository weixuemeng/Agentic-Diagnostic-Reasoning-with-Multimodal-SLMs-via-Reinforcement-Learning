 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute hepatic encephalopathy, decreasing mental status. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
 progression of the widespread known left-sided parenchymal opacities.  There
 also is a minimal increase in extent of a preexisting right basal opacity,
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  The apparent increase of both changes might be
 overemphasized by smaller lung volumes than on the previous examination.
 
 Unchanged absence of pleural effusions, moderate cardiomegaly, known
 left-sided rib fractures.
