                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with intubation, question of a left lower lobe
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 portable supine radiograph from ___ acquired less than 24 hours
 apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.4 cm above the carina, right
 internal jugular line terminates at mid SVC, and orogastric tube is seen to
 course into the stomach; however, the distal end is looped with the tip in the
 fundus.  Since yesterday's radiograph, increased opacity in the left lower
 lung, reflecting atelectasis, has improved.  Small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  There are no new lung opacities on the right side.  Minimal
 opacity in the right lung base from the prior radiograph has resolved
 suggesting it was atelectasis.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
