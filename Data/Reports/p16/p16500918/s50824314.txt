 placement      new PA cath insertion-check placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ 3:42 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Configuration of the PA catheter suggests it is looped in the main pulmonary
 artery but it could be in the proximal left pulmonary artery. Pleural and
 mediastinal drains, ET tube, nasogastric tube, and transvenous right atrial
 and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.  Tiny right apical
 pneumothorax unchanged.  There is probably no left pneumothorax or appreciable
 pleural effusion.
