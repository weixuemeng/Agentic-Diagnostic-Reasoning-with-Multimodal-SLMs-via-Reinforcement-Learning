                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and abdominal tenderness.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis
 from the same day on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right chest wall pacemaker leads are appropriately positioned.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  Bibasilar opacities with patchy opacities in the
 right mid lung may represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. 
 Partial collapse of the right lower lobe is better visualized on the
 concurrent CT.  Prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally with hilar
 fullness suggest pulmonary congestion.  NO pneumothorax.  There are
 degenerative changes throughout the spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and
 pulmonary congestion.
 
 2. Partial right lower lobe collapse. Bibasilar and patchy opacities which may
 also represent atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded.
