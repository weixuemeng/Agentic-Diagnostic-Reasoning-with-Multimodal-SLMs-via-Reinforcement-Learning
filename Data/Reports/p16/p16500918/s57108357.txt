  1.  Moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema.
  
  2.   A nodule is seen anterior to the spine on the lateral view.  Recommend
  follow-up with non-emergent CT of the chest once pulmonary edema has resolved.
  
  3.  Poor aeration of the right base may be due to pleural effusion.  Recommend
  follow-up once pulmonary edema has resolved.
  
  4.  Enlarged pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary artery hypertension.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // eval infiltrate vs chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a moderate to large
 right-sided pleural effusion. Increased interstitial markings are present
 throughout the lungs, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Poor aeration of
 the right base may be due to pleural effusion.  A nodule is seen anterior to
 the spine on the lateral view.  There is no pneumothorax or consolidation. The
 patient is status post dual-lead pacemaker placement, with leads ending in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is enlarged.  Enlarged pulmonary
 vasculature suggests pulmonary artery hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.   A nodule is seen anterior to the spine on the lateral view.  Recommend
 follow-up with non-emergent CT of the chest once pulmonary edema has resolved.
 
 3.  Poor aeration of the right base may be due to pleural effusion.  Recommend
 follow-up once pulmonary edema has resolved.
 
 4.  Enlarged pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary artery hypertension.
