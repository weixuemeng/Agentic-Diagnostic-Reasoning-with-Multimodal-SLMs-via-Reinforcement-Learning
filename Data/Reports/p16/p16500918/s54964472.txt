                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There are substantial bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure is seen.
 
 More coalescent opacification at the right base could merely reflect
 atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
