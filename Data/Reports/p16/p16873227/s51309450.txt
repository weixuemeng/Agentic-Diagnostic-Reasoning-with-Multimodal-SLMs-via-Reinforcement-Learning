                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // ___M sob      .  Prior studies indicate
 a history of renal cell and thyroid cancers.  Targeted review of chest CT from
 ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from fibroid fifteenth ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  Mild diffuse prominence of
 interstitial markings may also relate to COPD.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Faint rounded densities seen over lower most portion of both lungs are are not
 fully characterized on this exam.  Otherwise, within limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodules are
 identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD.  Doubt acute pulmonary process.
 
 Vague rounded densities over the lower most portion of both lungs, not fully
 characterized.  These could represent artifact due to overlapping vascular and
 osseous shadows.  Based on targeted review of the ___ CT scan, they
 appear relatively low 2 represent nipple shadows.  Consider further assessment
 with shallow oblique AP radiographs of the chest, with nipple markers, or
 alternatively  chest CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Vague rounded densities over the lower most portion of both lungs, not fully
 characterized. Consider further assessment with shallow oblique AP radiographs
 of the chest, with nipple markers, or alternatively chest CT.
