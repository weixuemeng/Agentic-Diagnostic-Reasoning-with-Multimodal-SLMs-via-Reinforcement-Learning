  Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary vascular
  congestion raises the possibility of CHF exacerbation.  The right hilum is
  also more prominent compared to prior and could be due to vascular
  engorgement. PA and lateral chest radiographs are recommended after treatment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP and SOB  // ?cpd
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Image quality is suboptimal due to radiation scatter.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is slightly worse compared to prior.  Hazy right
 basilar opacities may be due to mediastinal fat and atelectasis.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  The right hilum is a bit more
 prominent compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion raises the possibility of CHF exacerbation.  The right hilum is
 also more prominent compared to prior and could be due to vascular
 engorgement.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral chest radiographs after treatment.
