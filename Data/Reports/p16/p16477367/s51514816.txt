                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, cp evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph.  Right shoulder radiographs from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hilar fullness likely represents pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting
 of mild-to-moderate pulmonary interstitial edema.  The right hilum was full on
 the prior right shoulder radiograph.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 otherwise unremarkable without appreciable cardiomegaly.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial edema with associated hilar fullness. 
 Consider followup radiographs following diuresis to exclude hilar adenopathy. 
 No focal consolidation.
