                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  A
 moderate-to-large loculated right pleural effusion is longstanding, but
 appears increased in size from prior exam.  Moderate loculated left pleural
 effusion is unchanged from prior.  Bibasilar opacities are noted.  There is
 prominence of the right mediastinum, suggestive of vascular congestion. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Heart size is top normal.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is present.  Sternotomy wires are noted.  Multiple surgical
 clips project over left cardiac border.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate-to-large loculated right pleural effusion appears increased in size
 from prior exam.  Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary edema.
