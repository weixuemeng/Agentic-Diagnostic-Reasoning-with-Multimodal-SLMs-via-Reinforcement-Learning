                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with shortness of breath
 and cough.  History of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided dual-lumen
 hemodialysis catheter is noted with tip terminating at the junction of the SVC
 and right atrium.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG, with
 multiple broken median sternotomy wires redemonstrated.  Heart size is top
 normal.  There are low lung volumes, with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures and likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are again noted, which appear loculated laterally and are similar in
 size when compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases
 most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged with aortic
 knob calcifications again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with unchanged
 small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with laterally loculated
 components.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
