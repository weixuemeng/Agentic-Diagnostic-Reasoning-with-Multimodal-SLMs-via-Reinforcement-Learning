                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds
 in bases, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  There is evidence of sternotomy and previous bypass surgery
 with moderate cardiac enlargement.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an
 upper zone redistribution pattern, but no conclusive evidence for interstitial
 or alveolar edema is present.  Bilateral pleural space thickenings are seen
 along the lateral lower chest walls measuring up to 3 and 4 cm at the bases. 
 The pleural densities extend into the posterior compartments as identified on
 the lateral view.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates.  No evidence of pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  When
 comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of
 ___, the described mostly basal located pleural thickenings were
 similar and appear rather stable.  The pulmonary vasculature appears, however,
 now slightly more congested.  Review of previous PA and lateral chest
 examinations from ___, ___ and ___ demonstrated that the pleural
 thickenings existed already at that time.  Considering the rather stable
 pleural thickenings could consider that they are at least in part organized
 and represent scar formations in this patient with history of end-stage renal
 disease.
