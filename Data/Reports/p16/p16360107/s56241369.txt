                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  HIV and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Deshiscences  among
 sternal wires appear unchanged. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear
 stable a and seem to be due to chronic collections which were also
 characterized on prior CT with associated round atelectasis especially at the
 right lung base. There has been little if any change. Although there is no
 evidence of acute process should be noted that background abnormalities may
 lower the sensitivity of chest radiography.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable chronic abnormalities including bilateral moderate loculated pleural
 effusions and areas of round atelectasis.
