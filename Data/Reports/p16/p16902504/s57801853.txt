                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute mental status changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The patient is rotated on the
 current examination.  The lungs are clear.  No confluent opacity is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, possibly suggestive of underlying
 liver pathology.  A metallic fragment is seen within the right supraclavicular
 soft tissues, it is uncertain whether this is a retained foreign body or
 something overlying the patient, correlate clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Metallic fragment overlying the soft tissues of the right supraclavicular
 region.  Findings may represent something overlying the patient.  Correlate
 clinically.
 3.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm may be related to underlying liver pathology.
