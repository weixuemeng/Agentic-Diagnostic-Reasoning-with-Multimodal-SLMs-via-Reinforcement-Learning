                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral healed rib fractures have
 developed since the prior radiograph with a marked callus formation at the
 fracture sites.  A focal opacity overlying the right tenth posterior rib level
 could also potentially be due to healed fracture, but it is difficult to
 distinguish from a focal area of pneumonic consolidation.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Focal opacity at right tenth posterior rib level, which could be due to callus
 from a healed fracture or an early focus of pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 chest radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
