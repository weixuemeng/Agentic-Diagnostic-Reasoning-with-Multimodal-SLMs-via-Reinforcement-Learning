                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p spine surgery, desats, r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. However, there is a new right lower lobe airspace
 opacity with new volume loss and mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are magnified by the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe airspace opacity with associated volume loss is likely
 due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
