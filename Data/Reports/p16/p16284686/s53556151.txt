                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP  // eval for cardiomeg, ptx, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded. Subtle worsening opacity at the right base
 may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia although this is not definitively
 confirmed on the lateral projection. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, and
 hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the right base may reflect atelectasis, however pneumonia is
 possible in the right clinical context. Oblique views would be helpful in
 confirming this abnormality.
