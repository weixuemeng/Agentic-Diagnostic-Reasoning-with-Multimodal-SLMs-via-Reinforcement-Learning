                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreas transplant, now w/rising
 leukocytosis  // Is there an acute source of infection?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is negligible interval change.
 
 The right subclavian PICC line tip lies slightly higher, over the distal SVC. 
 The previously seen punctate opacities at the left-greater-than-right bases
 appear slightly less pronounced at the left base, but are likely actually
 unchanged.  These have been attributed to chronic punctate calcifications in
 the lung bases, possibly sequela of previous interstitial pneumonitis at a
 time of renal insufficiency (based on ___ chest CT).
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or
 consolidation, or effusion is identified.  Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.
 
 A mesh stent overlies the inner portion of the left arm
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. Punctate calcifications at the lung bases are a chronic finding and are
 likely unchanged.
