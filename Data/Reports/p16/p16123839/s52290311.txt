                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  As seen previously,
 innumerable tiny nodular opacities are again noted in both lung bases,
 compatible with chronic punctate calcifications which are likely the sequela
 of prior interstitial pneumonitis.  No new focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
