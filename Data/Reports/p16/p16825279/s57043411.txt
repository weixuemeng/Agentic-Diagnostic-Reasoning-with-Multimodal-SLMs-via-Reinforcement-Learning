                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with decreased bs right lung, r/o RUL lesion
 based upon ___ CXR  // r/o lesion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is background hyperinflation, consistent with background COPD.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  On lateral view, note
 is made of slightly tortuous tubular structure which may represent a densely
 calcified coronary artery.  Of a densely calcified Coronary artery. 
 Calcifications the paratracheal region are again noted.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  There is tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm and obscuration of the right costophrenic angle seen on the AP
 view, but not confirmed on the lateral view.  This could represent residual
 scarring and/or small amount loculated right lateral pleural fluid or
 thickening.  Minimal linear scarring is also noted in the right mid lung. The
 configuration of the chest including the right lung, is keeping with findings
 on the chest x-ray from ___, with interval improvement of previously
 seen right base atelectasis.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 remain grossly clear.
 
 Note is made of severe kyphosis in the mid thoracic spine and a pectus
 carinatum configuration, with  anterior wedge of multiple vertebral bodies,
 which appears similar to ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tenting and scarring at the right lung base is similar to ___.  No
 obvious superimposed pneumonic infiltrate identified.  A small amount of
 pleural fluid would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Cardiomegaly and COPD, similar to prior.
 
 Right paratracheal calcifications again noted.  Allowing for this, no right
 upper lobe lesion is identified.
 
 Trabecular pattern of the visualized vertebral bodies is compatible with renal
 osteodystrophy.  There is suggestion of a rugger ___ bone density pattern
 in the vertebral bodies which can be seen with hyperparathyroidism.
