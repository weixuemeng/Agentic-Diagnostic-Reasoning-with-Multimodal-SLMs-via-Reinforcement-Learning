                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F w h/a , blurry vision and floaters  // r/o intrapulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph from an outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's thoracic spine is markedly kyphotic.  There is stable elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm and enlargement of the right pulmonary artery.  An
 air space opacity at the base of the right lung could represent atelectasis or
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged and the aorta is tortuous.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basal opacity likely represents atelectasis however infection should be
 considered in the appropriate setting.  Markedly kyphotic thoracic spine.
