                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right VATS for mediastinal
 lymph node biopsy.  Study requested for evaluation of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, 10:40.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest AP radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 no visualization of a pleural line in the region of the right apex.  However,
 there is absence of lung structure in the two apical centimeters of the right
 hemithorax, suggesting that the size of preexisting pneumothorax is not
 substantially changed.  There is no evidence of tension. The left lung is
 clear. Pneumomediastinum appears less severe on this examination. Air
 collection is again seen in the right cervical and lateral soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION: Non visualization of pleural line with absence of lung structures
 in the two apical centimeters of the right hemithorax suggesting that size of
 preexisting pneumothorax is not substantially changed.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via telephone
