                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, worsening subcutaneous edema after right
 VATS.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.  A right apical
 pneumothorax persists, and is perhaps slightly smaller than on the prior study
 performed two days ago.  There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right chest wall.  There is no evidence of tension.  The pneumomediastinum is
 less apparent on the study.  Subtle small right inferolateral pulmonary
 opacities persist.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is a small amount of bilateral basilar atelectasis.  The left
 costophrenic angle is blunted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent, but somewhat smaller right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Subtle small right inferolateral pulmonary
 opacities persist.
 3.  Blunted left costophrenic angle, small effusion vs atelectasis.
