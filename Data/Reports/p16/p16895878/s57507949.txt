  1. Low lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this, stable appearance of
  the cardiomediastinal silhouettes.
  2. Persistent retrocardiac opacity, nonspecific.  ___ represent atelectasis
  versus pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
  3. Diffuse interstitial prominence with a central predominance, with
  suggestion of interlobular septal thickening, likely represents pulmonary
  vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, although there may be some
  component of crowding of normal structures contributing to this appearance.
  4. Trace left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CLL, admitted with fevers, concern for
 possible retrocardiac process, now with rapid recovery  // further
 characterization of retrocardiac process, signs of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest Portable ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Around 10 mm opacity projecting over the left lung apex could be a lung
 nodule, perhaps calcified.
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened.  Increased opacification of
 the left lower lobe concerning for a pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectasis and
 pleural effusions are noted. No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac, hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Worsening interstitial edema.
 2.  Possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
 3.  Stable lung nodule.  Recommend conventional radiographs and low
 kilovoltage views to look for calcification, when feasible.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Stable lung nodule.  Recommend conventional radiographs to
 further assess when feasible.
