                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CLL, resp failure  // ?interval change     
 ?interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. 
 Monitoring and support devices are stable.  Again there is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with bilateral layering pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  Again is difficult to assess the degree of
 pulmonary edema.  Given the extensive changes, it would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
