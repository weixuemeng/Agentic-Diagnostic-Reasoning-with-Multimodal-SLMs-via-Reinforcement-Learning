                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough productive of sputum for the past two weeks, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain under-inflated with slightly improved inspiratory
 effort compared to the most recent prior study.  There is persistent mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right.  The
 bronchovascular markings are slightly accentuated in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Despite this, no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
