                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, body aches and productive cough for four days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without otherwise acute cardiopulmonary process.
