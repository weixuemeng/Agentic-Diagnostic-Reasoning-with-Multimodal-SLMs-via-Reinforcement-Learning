                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:44 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Likely ventilator associated pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been a generalized worsening of heterogeneous pulmonary
 opacification in both lungs.  Since accompanying it is greater dilatation of
 mediastinal veins, I suspect this is asymmetrically distributed edema though
 followup will be needed to exclude pneumonia.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  A right subclavian central venous line ends close to or just
 beyond the superior cavoatrial junction.  An upper enteric tube passes into
 the stomach.  No pneumothorax.
