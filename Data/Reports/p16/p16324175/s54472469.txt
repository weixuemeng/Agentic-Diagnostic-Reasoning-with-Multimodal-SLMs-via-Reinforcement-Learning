 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 16:17.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube seen with tip 6.5 cm from
 the carina, just above the clavicular heads and can be advanced 2 cm for
 optimal positioning.  Nasogastric tube seen with tip in the gastric body.  Low
 lung volumes are seen.  Mild left basilar opacity silhouettes the left
 costophrenic angle, potentially due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged and there is
 prominence of the aortic knob.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
