 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:41 AM
  1. Mild pulmonary edema with trace right pleural effusion.
  2. Ventricular lead of the pacemaker terminates in the midline, and is
  typically seen closer to the cardiac apex.  Recommend correlation with
  intraoperative fluoroscopy during placement.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardia.  Evaluate pacemaker placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest wall pacemaker generator with dual chamber leads.  The right atrial
 lead projects over the midline and the presumed ventricular lead terminates
 over the central mediastinum rather than near the cardiac apex as is usually
 seen.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Represent redistribution and central
 pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Mild interstitial edema is seen.  No
 large pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with trace right pleural effusion.
 2.  Ventricular lead of the pacemaker terminates in the midline, and is
 typically seen closer to the cardiac apex.  Recommend correlation with
 pacemaker interrogation.
