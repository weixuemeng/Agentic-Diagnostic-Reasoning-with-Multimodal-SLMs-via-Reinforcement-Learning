                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There is
 accentuation of interstitial markings, consistent with chronic process as
 well.  However, no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the left is essentially unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
