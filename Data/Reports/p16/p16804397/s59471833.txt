  1. Low lung volumes.
  2. Bibasilar airspace opacities may represent atelectasis or pneumonia,
  depending upon the clinical circumstances.
  3. Increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion with new small bilateral
  pleural effusions without frank pulmonary edema.
  4. Subtle areas of nodularity and interstitial prominence are compatible with
  known pulmonary metastatic disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath evaluate for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___ and chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Small lung nodules consistent with metastasis are better seen on prior CT. 
 There is probably mild vascular congestion.  If any there are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities best appreciated on the
 lateral view represent atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable with moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely represent atelectasis, less likely
 pneumonia, depending upon the clinical circumstances
 3. Minimal vascular congestion
 4. Small lung nodules are better seen on prior CT consistent with metastasis
