                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o DM, RA (on MTX), mild interstitial
 lung disease. Presents with 2 wk h/o SOB, wheeze, and productive cough. Not
 improved with Z-pak and albuterol MDI // r/o infiltrate. **** PLEASE CALL WET
 READ TO ___ ****
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___, ___.
 CT Chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal interstitial reticular appearance in the lower lung bases is unchanged
 and better characterized on prior CT.  Given the obscuring appearance of
 interstitial disease, it is difficult to rule out left lower lobe pneumonia,
 but the hemidiaphragms are clear which supports a lack of pneumonia. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Given interstitial disease, it is difficult to rule out lower lobe
 pneumonia but clear appearance of the hemidiaphragms support a lack of
 pneumonia process. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
