                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with post arrest  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the prior CT. 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable and the hilar contours are within normal limits. No pulmonary
 edema is identified. Hazy opacity is seen within the right upper and mid lung
 fields.  Focal opacity is also seen within the retrocardiac region. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is gaseous distention of the
 stomach.  No acutely displaced rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip in standard position.
 2. Hazy opacity within the right upper and mid lung fields which may reflect
 an area of aspiration or infection.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis but an additional site of infection is not excluded.
 3. Gaseous distention of stomach.
