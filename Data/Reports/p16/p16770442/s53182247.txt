                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  There appears to be interval worsening of the opacity seen in the
 right lung as well as an interval increase in opacification throughout the
 left lung, concerning for ARDS, although an infectious process cannot be
 excluded. There is left lower lobe atelectasis, unchanged compared to the
 prior exam. A chest CT may be helpful for further evaluation.
