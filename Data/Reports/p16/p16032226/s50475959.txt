 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central
 venous catheter with tip traceable at least to the right atrium.  A left
 pectoral dual-channel pacemaker AICD has leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Thereis
 cardionegaly, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 improvement of known pulmonary edema.  There is persistent bibasilar collapse
 and/or consolidation, probably with small effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in the right
