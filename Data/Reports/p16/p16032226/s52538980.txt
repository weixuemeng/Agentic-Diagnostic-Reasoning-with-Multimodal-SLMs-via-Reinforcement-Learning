                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia with recurrent fevers. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right approach PICC tip terminates within the mid SVC.  Two pacing leads are
 demonstrated in standard positions within the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  
 
 Since the prior examination there has been a development of mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema and enlargement of still small bilateral layering pleural
 effusions.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There has been interval
 development of right basilar atelectasis and there is persistent left
 retrocardiac opacification.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 with the patient status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema and enlargement
 of still small layering bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Persistent retrocardiac opacification that could either represent
 atelectasis though pneumonia is also a possibility in the correct clinical
 setting.
