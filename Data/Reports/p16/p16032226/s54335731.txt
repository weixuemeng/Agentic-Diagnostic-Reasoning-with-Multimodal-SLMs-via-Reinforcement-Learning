                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities are present in the left
 retrocardiac region, difficult to evaluate on this single portable view. 
 Within the right lung, note is made of retrocardiac atelectasis and small
 right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening as well as chronic elevation
 of right hemidiaphragm.  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy
 and coronary bypass surgery, and a dual lead pacing device remains in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left lower lobe opacities, which could be due to mucoid
 impaction or peribronchial infiltration related to an infection.  Standard PA
 and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation of
 this region when the patient's condition permits.
