                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with 4 weeks of left scapular pain radiating to left
 arm with central chest discomfort and dynamic EKG changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinal widening is likely attributable to lower lung volumes.  The aortic
 knob remains distinct.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac region.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild
 degenerative changes noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes account for accentuation of the cardiac silhouette now
 appearing moderately enlarged.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis without focal
 consolidation.
