                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral chest wall pain and left paraspinal tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema identified.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours and hilar
 contours are normal.  Redemonstrated is a left humeral head prosthesis, and
 extensive degenerative changes noted within the right glenohumeral joint. 
 There is no displaced rib fracture identified.  Multi-level degenerative
 changes are noted within the thoracic spine, as well as an unchanged lower
 thoracic vertebral body wedge shaped deformity.  Diffuse idiopathic skeletal
 hyperostosis is noted along the anterior aspect of multiple thoracic vertebral
 bodies 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiologic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Extensive osteoarthritic changes within the thoracic spine and right
 glenoumeral joint, as well as thoracic DISH and a stable lower thoracic
 vertebral body wedge shaped deformity.  
 
 3.  No evidence for acute rib fracture.  In the setting of persistent clinical
 concern, a dedicated rib series can be obtained.
