 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:29 PM
  Right middle pleural-based mass corresponds to a metastasis seen on ___
  and ___ Atrius Imaging CT examinations (available remotely). No
  superimposed acute intrathoracic process detected. While no large pulmonary
  embolus is seen on the ___ CT exam, that protocol was not optimized to
  evaluate the subsegemental arteries.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Atrius CT examination available remotely, performed on ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 A pleural-based right middle zone mass is better seen on the Atrius CT
 examinations from ___ and ___ (not currently available on ___
 PACS).  Coarse reticular opacities throughout both lungs likely reflect mild
 pulmonary edema.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and the hilar and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Large right middle-zone pleural-based mass is seen on CT examinations from
 ___ Imaging on ___ and ___, compatible with
 metastatic RCC.  Of note, no large pulmonary embolus was detected on the
 ___ CT examination; however, that technique was not optimized for
 evaluation of the subsegmental arteries.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
