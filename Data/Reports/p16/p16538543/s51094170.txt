                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and rigors, concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is again seen an area of parenchymal density in the right mid lung which
 is pleural-based and consistent with known RCC metastatic deposit.  This is
 stable.  There is increased density at the left base suggestive of developing
 infiltrate or atelectasis.  Close attention to this area is recommended on
 subsequent exams.  There are no pneumothoraces.  The heart size is enlarged. 
 There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of
 minimal pulmonary edema.
