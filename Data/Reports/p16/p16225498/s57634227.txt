                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever, cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.  There is a
 retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm compatible
 with left lower lobe atelectasis or infection.  Within the lateral segment of
 the right middle lobe, there is a peripherally located consolidative opacity,
 which may be infectious in nature.  However, the downward displacement of the
 fissure suggests volume loss and thus an obstructing mass cannot be excluded. 
 Pulmonary infarction also cannot be excluded due to the wedge shaped
 peripheral consolidation.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 which may indicate pulmonary congestion. Multiple nodular opacities are also
 noted in both lungs. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due
 to obliteration of heart borders.  There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Right middle lobe peripheral consolidative opacity concerning for
 infection; however, downward displacement of the fissure suggests volume loss
 and thus obstructing mass cannot be excluded.  Pulmonary infarct is also a
 possibility given wedge like configuration.  Recommend CT of the chest for
 further evaluation.
 
 2. Retrocardiac opacity may be left lower lobe infection versus atelectasis.
 
 3. Multiple scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules. This again should be
 assessed with chest CT.
