                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory distress and tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___, lung volumes have improved and previous pulmonary vascular
 congestion has decreased.  Whether these are real physiologic improvements are
 due in part to interval placement of endotracheal tube in standard position
 from positive pressure ventilation is radiographically indeterminate.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  In the right mid lung is relatively small residual of
 previous large area of consolidation and possible loculated fissural pleural
 effusion.  Multiple lung nodules have not changed appreciably.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC and a
 nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
