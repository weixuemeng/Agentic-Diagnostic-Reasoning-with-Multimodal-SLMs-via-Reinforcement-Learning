 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacities in the right lung base laterally are likely atelectasis
 versus scarring.  Focal opacity at the left cardiophrenic angle is compatible
 with a prominent epicardial fat pad as seen on prior.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
