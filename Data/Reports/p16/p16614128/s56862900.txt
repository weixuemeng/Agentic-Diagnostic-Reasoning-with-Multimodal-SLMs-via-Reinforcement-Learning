                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hematoma and cord compression intubated
 now spiking fevers  // Pna?     Pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increasing
 opacification at the bases. Again, this is worrisome for aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent
 with 8 pleural effusion. Monitoring and support devices are essentially
 unchanged.
