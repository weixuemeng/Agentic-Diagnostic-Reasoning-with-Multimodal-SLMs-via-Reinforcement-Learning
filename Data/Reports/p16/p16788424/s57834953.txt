 An AP semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There are streaky patchy opacities at both lung bases which may reflect
 areas of patchy atelectasis, although aspiration pneumonia certainly could
 have this radiographic appearance.  Followup imaging may be helpful.  No
 pleural effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
