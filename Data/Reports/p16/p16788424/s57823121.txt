                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, nonverbal.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and 3:07 today.
 
 FINDINGS: There is subtle increased opacity in the lung bases. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle increase in opacities of the lung bases might reflect
 atelectasis, although, a developing aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded.
