                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with asthma, pneumonia ___, ongoing
 shortness of breath  // follow up pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___ with

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly which is stable.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 widened and stable.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with no
 evidence of previously seen left lower lobe pneumonia which is likely
 secondary to a persistent consolidation to base and likely represents a left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  .  There is no evidence of focal consolidations,
 pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  Again seen is a moderate hiatal hernia
 which is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Elevation of left hemidiaphragm with persistent consolidation of the left
 lung base in the setting of a cleared pneumonia likely represents left lower
 lobe atelectasis.
 2. No evidence of acute on chronic heart disease.
