                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right internal jugular line placement.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained earlier.
 
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Interval development of
 bilateral linear opacities might reflect interval development of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Aspiration would be another possibility although less
 likely.
