                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for several weeks, suspected pneumonia or
 congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ and multiple prior studies dating back
 to at least ___.
 
 Severe dextroscoliosis is unchanged.  The aeration of the left lower lung is
 limited most likely due to substantial atelectasis in a patient with severe
 scoliosis.  No interval progression in this appearance has been demonstrated
 to suggest interval development of infectious process in this area.
 
 On the other hand there is new nodular opacity in the left suprahilar area,
 projecting at the level of the aortopulmonic window that might reflect
 infectious process or less likely a malignancy.  Right lung is clear.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  
 
 Followup of the patient four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
 recommended for documentation of resolution of the left perihilar abnormality.
