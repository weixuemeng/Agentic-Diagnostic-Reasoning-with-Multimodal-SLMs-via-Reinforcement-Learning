                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Confirm position of right IJ after revision.  Patient with
 MSSA bacteremia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier. 
 
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  Left PICC has been removed.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has increased.  Small
 right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has probably unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are a combination of pleural
 effusions and atelectasis.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  There is right
 mid thoracic scoliosis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette with cardiomegaly and
 widened mediastinum is stable.
