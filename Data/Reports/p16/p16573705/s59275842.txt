                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size and is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  A
 more confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region has progressed,
 and probably represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although
 infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. A
 component of the left-sided pleural opacity is related to pleural thickening
 and post-pleurodesis changes as demonstrated on prior chest CTA of ___.
