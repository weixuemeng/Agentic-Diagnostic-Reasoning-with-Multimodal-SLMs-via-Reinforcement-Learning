                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:   The films are limited due to patient positioning.  Severe
 dextroscoliosis unchanged. However, no gross focal consolidations are seen
 that are worrisome for an infectious process.  A left perihilar nodular
 opacity is not clearly seen today due to difference in technique.  No obvious
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is likely enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
