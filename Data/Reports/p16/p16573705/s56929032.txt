                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Patchy left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis, which may be
 associated with distortion of the thorax by moderate-to-severe rightward
 convex curvature of the thoracic spine.  Accordingly, however, the left base
 is difficult to assess.  The right lung appears clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
