  1. Increase in retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis however
  pneumonia cannot be excluded.
  2.  Persistent blunting of left costophrenic angle may be related to
  atelectasis, scarring, or trace pleural effusion.

  4. Levoscoliosis of thoracolumbar spine.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lung is clear.  Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity.  No right
 pleural effusion.  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
 related to atelectasis, scarring, or trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 Stable mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to patient positioning. 
 Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.  Again seen is levoscoliosis of
 the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increase in retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis however
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Persistent blunting of left costophrenic angle may be related to
 atelectasis, scarring, or trace pleural effusion.
