                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion, although a relative increase in the degree of
 diaphragmatic elevation on the right may potentially indicate subpulmonic
 effusion.  Relative hazy increased attenuation of the right lung compared to
 the left may be an artifact associated with positioning and technique.  A
 calcified granuloma is unchanged at the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  It may be
 appropriate to consider follow-up with standard PA and lateral radiographs if
 there is persistent clinical concern for acute cardiopulmonary pathology,
 given the limitation of this study.
