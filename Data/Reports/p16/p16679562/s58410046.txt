                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post extended right colectomy with
 crackles on lung exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Right pleural effusion is perhaps slightly larger than one day prior.  Left
 pleural fluid is similar.  There is widening of the mediastinal vascular
 pedicle, and increased interstitial markings compatible with mild congestive
 failure.  Superimposed infectious process could be obscured, particularly at
 the left lung base, though all the current findings could also be explained by
 congestive failure.  There is no pneumothorax.  Upper lungs remain well
 aerated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings again compatible with congestive failure.
