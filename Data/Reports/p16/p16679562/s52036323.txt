 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacities at the left
 and right lung base are decreased in extent.  Overall, the lung volumes have
 improved, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Unchanged borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged left lateral post-traumatic
 irregularities along the ribs with accompanying mild pleural thickening.  No
 evidence of pleural effusions.
