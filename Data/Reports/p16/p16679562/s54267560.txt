                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearances of the
 lung, the heart and the pleural spaces are unchanged.  In unchanged manner,
 there are motion artifacts.  Therefore, the esophageal part of the course of
 the nasogastric tube can only be seen in part.  A small part of the tube is
 visible projecting over the stomach, but the tube tip is not visualized on the
 image.  There is no evidence of complications.
