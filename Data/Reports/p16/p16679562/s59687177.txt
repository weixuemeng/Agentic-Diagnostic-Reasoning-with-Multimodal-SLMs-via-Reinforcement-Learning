                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sudden onset SOB, clear lungs  // r/o PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is persistent
 prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggesting component of pulmonary
 edema, which overall appears slightly improved as compared to the prior study.
 Basilar opacities have decreased since the prior study.  No pleural effusion
 is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Chronic deformity of the
 left-sided rib cage is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggest vascular engorgement with
 possible minimal interstitial edema, improved since the prior study.  Please
 note that pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded radiographically.
