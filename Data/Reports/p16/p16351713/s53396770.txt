                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary nodule on prior shoulder study.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the shoulder study dated ___, no nodule is
 seen in the right upper zone.  Indeed, the heart appears normal in size and
 there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or
 consolidation.
 
 In view of the bony structures overlying the right upper zone, consideration
 should be given to an apical lordotic view that could conceivably demonstrate
 a pulmonary nodule obscured on the current frontal view.
