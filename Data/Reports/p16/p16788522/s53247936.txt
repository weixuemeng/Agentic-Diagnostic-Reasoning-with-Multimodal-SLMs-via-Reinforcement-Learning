                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT and persistant desats.  Evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotational positioning of the patient makes assessment of heart size and lung
 volume more difficult.  However, new mild left lower lobe atelectasis is
 likely.  Small left pleural effusion, if any, is possible.  Left upper lobe
 and right lung are clear. There is no evidence for pleural edema or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.
  ETT, enteric tube and left-sided central line appear unchanged and are in
 standard position.  Aortic knob calcification appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New mild left lower lobe atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion, if any.
