                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right-sided chest pain s/p fall  // Eval for
 PTX, rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ reference made to chest CTA from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles suggests trace pleural effusions. Since the prior study, there has been
 interval increase in interstitial markings bilaterally which may represent
 worsening of known chronic lung disease with possible overlying acute
 component. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal
 contours are grossly stable. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. No definite
 displaced fracture is seen. There is moderate anterior wedging of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, similar since CT from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests trace pleural
 effusions. Since the prior study, there has been interval increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally which may represent worsening of known
 chronic lung disease with possible overlying acute component superimposed,
 pulmonary edema or infection not entirely excluded.
 
 No displaced fracture is identified. If high clinical concern, CT is more
 sensitive.
