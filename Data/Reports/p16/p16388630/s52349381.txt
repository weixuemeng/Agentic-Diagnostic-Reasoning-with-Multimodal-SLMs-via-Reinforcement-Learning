                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach // Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in place. Lung volumes remain low.  The left lower lung
 is essentially airless and probably collapsed. Retrocardiac opacity persists
 and appears worse from prior exam, suggesting atelectasis or aspiration
 appropriate clinical setting.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggest
 atelectasis and/or small effusion.  Platelike opacity in the right lower lung
 is probably atelectasis and slightly worse. The heart is severely enlarged,
 slightly worse compared to the prior exam.  No frank pulmonary edema. The
 aortic valve is calcified, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increase in cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Slightly worse right lower lung atelectasis.
 3. Stable severe left lung atelectasis.
