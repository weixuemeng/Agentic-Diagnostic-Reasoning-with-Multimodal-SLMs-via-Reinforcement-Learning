 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian PICC line has its tip now projecting in the azygos vein
 were previously it had its tip in the distal SVC.  The tracheostomy tube is
 unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 remains stably enlarged. Given the globular configuration to the cardiac
 shadow, a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is persistent
 but improving pulmonary edema. Layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar
 opacities suggest compressive atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax.
