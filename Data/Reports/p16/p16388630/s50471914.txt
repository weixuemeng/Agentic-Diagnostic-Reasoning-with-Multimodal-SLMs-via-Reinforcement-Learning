                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post op respiratory failure // r/o
 pneumonia / atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place.  Increased retrocardiac airspace opacity is
 inseparable from the descending aorta, and may be due to worsening
 atelectasis, although infection or aspiration would be difficult to exclude in
 the appropriate clinical context. The right lung remains clear. There is no
 pneumothorax. Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left basilar airspace opacification may be due to worsening
 atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  However, a PA and lateral radiograph is
 suggested to exclude descending aortic pathology.
