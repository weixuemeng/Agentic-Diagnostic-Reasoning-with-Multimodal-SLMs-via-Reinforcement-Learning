                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy presenting with fever.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post tracheostomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable including cardiomegaly.  Although less striking than
 before there are central congestive changes, and in addition, focal opacity in
 the right lower lung best seen on the anterior view.  Pleural effusions have
 resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal opacity in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe;
 differential considerations include pneumonia versus atelectasis.  Correlation
 with clinical presentation is suggested.  Findings also suggesting mild
 vascular congestion.
