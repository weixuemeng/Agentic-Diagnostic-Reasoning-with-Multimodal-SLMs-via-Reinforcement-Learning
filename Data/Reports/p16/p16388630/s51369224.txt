                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach, acute desaturation  // Acute
 pulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 2 days earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild edema have the improved.  Right pleural effusion appears slightly smaller
 with persistent adjacent right middle and right lower lobe opacities. On the
 left, there is worsening retrocardiac opacification, possibly on the basis of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying infectious process is also
 possible in the appropriate setting.
