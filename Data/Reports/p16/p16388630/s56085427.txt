                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, hypoxia, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a right-sided PICC line that terminates most likely at the confluence
 of the brachiocephalic veins.  The heart is enlarged.  There is bilateral
 hilar congestion, and in addition to mild pulmonary edema, asymmetric
 opacification of the left mid to lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild zone pulmonary edema, but with concern for focal
 opacification in the left lower lung which may indicate coinciding atelectasis
 or pneumonia.
