                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weakness and chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The frontal view
 is somewhat limited in overall evaluation due to underpenetration in the
 setting of large body habitus.  Allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs of CHF.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
