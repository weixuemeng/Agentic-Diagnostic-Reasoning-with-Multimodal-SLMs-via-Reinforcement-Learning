                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Agitation, chest pain and leg swelling.  Dementia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  A right mid lung opacity has essentially resolved. Streaky
 opacities at the left lung base have improved and suggest minor residual
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of acute disease.  Low lung volumes and suspected minor
 left basilar atelectasis.
