                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post left-sided thoracocentesis,
 evaluate for pneumothorax and interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  In the interval, a
 left-sided thoracocentesis has been performed resulting in diminished density
 on the left base overlying the enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Pulmonary
 vasculature in the left-sided hemithorax can be identified and is not
 congested.  There is no evidence of remaining pneumothorax in the apical area.
 Right-sided hemithorax is unchanged with unaltered position of previously
 described right-sided subclavian approach central venous line.
