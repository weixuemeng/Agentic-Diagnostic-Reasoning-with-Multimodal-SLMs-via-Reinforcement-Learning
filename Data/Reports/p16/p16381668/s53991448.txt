                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:00 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip
 projecting approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  An esophageal catheter
 courses below the diaphragm with tip projecting over the left upper quadrant,
 likely within the stomach.  There is a large left pleural effusion and small
 right pleural effusion, as seen previously, with underlying left lower lung
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected on this single supine view. 
 Pulmonary vascular prominence persists without radiographic evidence for overt
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of
 overlying pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation and placement of an esophageal catheter in
 standard positions.
