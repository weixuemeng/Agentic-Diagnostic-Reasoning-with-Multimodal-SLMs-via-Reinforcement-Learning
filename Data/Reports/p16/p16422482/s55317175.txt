                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of increased tiredness,
 clear on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position.  Diffuse prominence
 of the hila and bilateral interstitial markings consistent with pulmonary
 edema.  Left greater than right small bilateral pleural effusions are seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette
 mildly enlarged and the aorta calcified.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may
 relate to prominent vasculature and pleural effusions, although underlying
 consolidation from infection cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema and small left greater than right bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Subtle left retrocardiac opacity may relate to edema and
 pleural effusions, although underlying consolidation from infection cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally, on the lateral
 view, more focal opacity projecting over the anterior cardiac silhouette, not
 well localized on the frontal view, consolidation from infection not excluded.
