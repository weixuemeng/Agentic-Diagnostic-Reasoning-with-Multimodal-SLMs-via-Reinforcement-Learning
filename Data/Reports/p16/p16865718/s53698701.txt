                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DVT with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 with otherwise little overall change.  Extensive sclerotic changes in the ribs
 are consistent with known metastatic disease and there is continued blunting
 of the costophrenic angle on the left consistent with pleural thickening.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
