                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no significant interval change
 compared to the prior exam.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Pleural thickening with scarring in the left lung base appears unchanged, as
 well as left apical pleuroparenchymal scarring.  Left sided sclerotic rib
 deformities compatible with known metastatic lesions are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change, with no new areas of
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
