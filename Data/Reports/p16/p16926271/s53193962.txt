                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same evening.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 4 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube has been passed and terminates
 perhaps shortly beyond the gastroesophageal junction.  Findings associated
 with pulmonary edema appear not substantially changed.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions persist.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  Orogastric tube could be advanced
 somewhat if deeper seating in the stomach is desired clinically.  Persistent
 findings associated with pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions.
