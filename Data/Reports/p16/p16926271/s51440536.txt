                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male with a history of CAD (s/p three-vessel CABG),
 partial nephrectomy, and left foot ulcer who was transferred from ___
 ___ for bradycardia. On ECG, he had junctional rhythm approximately 40bpm
 which improved to idioventricular rhythm at 85bpm on dopamine.  // Interval
 change?   Interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the basilar opacification now on the
 right consistent with layering effusion and compressive atelectasis is less
 prominent.  It is unclear whether this represents decreased pleural effusion
 or merely a more upright position of the patient.  Otherwise, little change
 except for removal of the left IJ catheter.
