 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, and as a consequence, the heart appears minimally larger
 than on the previous examination.  Otherwise, there is no relevant change, the
 lung parenchyma is normal.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.  No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.  Minimal tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
