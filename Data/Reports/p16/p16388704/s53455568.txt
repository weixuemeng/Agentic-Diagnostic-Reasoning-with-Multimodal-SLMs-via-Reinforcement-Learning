                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check PICC line.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left-sided PICC line with tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  The heart size is mildly enlarged and is larger than on the prior
 study.  There is obscuration of the left CP angle and it is unclear if this is
 due to a small area of volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  Otherwise, the lungs
 are clear.
