                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST of ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pleural effusion has increased in size and is now small to
 moderate.  Adjacent increasing opacity in left lower lobe is associated with
 volume loss, with posterior displacement of the left major fissure.  Small
 right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed from the prior study, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are also stable in appearance compared to the
 recent study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing left pleural effusion with adjacent left lower lobe opacity
 which likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of volume loss.  However,
 coexisting pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.
