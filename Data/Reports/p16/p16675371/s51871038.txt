  Subtle opacity projects over the lateral right lung base, over the lateral
  right tenth rib ; unclear whether this is external to the patient or
  represents a pulmonary nodular opacity.  Recommend shallow oblique chest
  radiographs to further assess.
  No focal consolidation seen elsewhere.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with DOE and lightheadedness  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, with relative flattening of the diaphragms. 
 Subtle opacity is seen projecting over the lateral right lung base over the
 lateral right tenth rib.  Unclear whether this represents a pulmonary nodular
 opacity versus being external to the patient.  Shallow oblique chest
 radiographs would help further assess.  There is mild left base atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projects over the lateral right lung base, over the lateral
 right tenth rib ; unclear whether this is external to the patient or
