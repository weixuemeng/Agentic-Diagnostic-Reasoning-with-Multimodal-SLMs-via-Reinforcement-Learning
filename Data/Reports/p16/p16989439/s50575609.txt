  1. Faint posterior costophrenic sulcus of airspace opacity may represent very
  early pneumonia or atelectasis depending on the clinical setting.  No other
  acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Hyperexpansion suggesting emphysema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Please note that comparison to old studies can be helpful
 to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild hyperexpansion suggests emphysema.  Faint airspace opacity in the
 posterior costophrenic sulcus may represent very early pneumonia or
 atelectasis depending on the clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 Right hemidiaphragm eventration is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Faint posterior costophrenic sulcus of airspace opacity may represent very
 early pneumonia or atelectasis depending on the clinical setting.  No other
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Hyperexpansion suggesting emphysema.
