                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ AT 19:38 HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding at the
 lung bases.  Ill-defined densities noted particularly in the retrocardiac left
 lower lobe.  No further consolidation or edema is evident.  The mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Density at the lung bases, particularly in the left lower lobe is
 presumed atelectasis given volume loss.  However, an early developing
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Repeat with improved depth of
 inspiration would be helpful, otherwise empiric treatment with short interval
 followup.
