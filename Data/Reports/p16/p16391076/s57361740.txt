                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male patient with DKA status post line placement. Study
 requested to rule out pneumothorax and evaluate central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, 4:14.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable semi erect AP chest radiograph. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left subclavian line tip overlies the right-sided mediastinal portion, at
 the level of the carina and compatible with the SVC. Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged. Symmetrical, bilateral central parenchymal opacities
 are noted as before, consistent with pulmonary congestion and demonstrate
 interval improvement. Hazy densities at the bases of the lungs persist
 suggesting continued presence of bilateral pleural effusions in this
 semi-erect patient. There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left subclavian line tip overlies right-sided mediastinal portion, at level
 of the carina and compatible with the SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2. Interval improvement of pulmonary congestion with continued presence of
 bilateral pleural effusions.
