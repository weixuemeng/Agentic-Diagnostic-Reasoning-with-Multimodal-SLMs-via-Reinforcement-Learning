                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Bilateral
 perihilar and lower lung opacities have slightly improved.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions also appear slightly smaller, but positional differences
 could potentially contribute to this apparent change.  Bilateral retrocardiac
 opacities are unchanged.  No new or worsening lung abnormalities.
