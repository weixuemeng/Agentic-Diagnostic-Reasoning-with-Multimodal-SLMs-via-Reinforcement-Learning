                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute hypoxemia, evaluate for new
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding five portable chest examinations from ___
 through ___.  There is further regression of the previously described
 bilateral extensive pulmonary parenchymal densities.  Specifically, very
 advanced density in the right upper lobe area has undergone marked regression.
 Widespread poorly delineated patchy infiltrates, however, remain.  Noticeable
 is that the lateral pleural sinuses are free and that there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Previously described right internal jugular
 approach wide-bore hemodialysis line remains in unchanged position.  Heart
 size remains normal.  There is no evidence of typical pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further regression of previously described multifocal parenchymal
 infiltrates.  No evidence of any new process.
