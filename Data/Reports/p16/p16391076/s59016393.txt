                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal failure, on hemodialysis with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is
 continued diffuse opacification in the middle and lower lung zones, more
 prominent on the right.  This is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and may
 be slightly worsening since the previous study.
 
 Hemodialysis catheter remains in good position.
