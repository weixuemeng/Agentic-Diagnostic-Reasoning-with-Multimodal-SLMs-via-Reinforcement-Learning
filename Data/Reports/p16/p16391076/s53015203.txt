                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diabetes and ketoacidosis with respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
 Moderate subglottic edema reflects recent tracheal  intubation.  A left
 subclavian central line ends in the upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Uniform opacification at the right base suggests a small subpulmonic pleural
 effusion.  Mild hazy opacification at the left base could be atelectasis or
 aspiration.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right subpulmonic pleural effusion.
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis or aspiration.
 3.  Moderate post-intubation subglottic edema.
