                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough and chest tightness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Streaky
 bilateral mid lung linear atelectasis is seen.  Right basilar opacity may be
 due to atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bilateral mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring.  Subtle
 patchy right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis, although an early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
