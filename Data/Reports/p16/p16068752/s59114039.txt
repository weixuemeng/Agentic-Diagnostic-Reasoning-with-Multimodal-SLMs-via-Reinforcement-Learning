                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change when allowances are made for accentuation by lower lung volumes on
 today's study.  Lungs are clear except for linear bibasilar atelectasis. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute, displaced rib
 fracture is evident on this chest radiograph examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax or grossly displaced anterior rib
 fracture.  Conventional chest radiographs are relatively insensitive for
 detecting anterior rib fractures, and dedicated coned-down rib radiograph at
 the site of point tenderness could be considered for more complete evaluation
 if warranted clinically.
