                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and recent liver resection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a streaky opacity in the right mid lung which has
 coalesced, suggesting scarring or atelectasis, but overall aeration of the
 lungs has improved, including resolution of a band-like opacity in the left
 lower lung.  There is persistent mild-to-moderate elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with a drain projecting over the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air is seen. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis or scarring.
