                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain, possible pulmonary embolus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A small angular opacity at the periphery of the lower pole of the right hilus
 could be due to a superimposition of normal structures.  I would recommend
 oblique views for clarification before assuming that there is a new lung
 lesion.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal and there is no
 pleural abnormality or evidence of central adenopathy.  Extensive spinal
 stabilization hardware is in place, not fully evaluated by this examination,
 but grossly unchanged since ___.  
 
 At the time of review of this study, a chest CTA had already been performed. 
 It showed there was no lung lesion in the right perihilar area.
