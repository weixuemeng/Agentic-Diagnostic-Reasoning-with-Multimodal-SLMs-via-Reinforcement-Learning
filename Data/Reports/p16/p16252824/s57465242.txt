                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MM and RLL pneumonia s/p chest tube.  //
 Please assess for interval change in effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to chest radiograph from 1 day prior, interval decrease in lung
 volumes.  This decreased may account for the more kinked lower appearance of
 the right pigtail catheter.  Multiloculated pleural effusion has not
 substantially changed.  Known loculated fluid along the fissure and
 surrounding likely pneumonia has not substantially changed given for
 differences in technique.  Left-sided pleural fluid/thickening slightly
 increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given the substantial decrease in lung volumes, overall no substantial change.
