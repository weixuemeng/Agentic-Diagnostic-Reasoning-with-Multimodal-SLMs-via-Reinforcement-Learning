                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with kinked chest tube, adjusted  // eval for
 chest tube placement      eval for chest tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 11:38 and
 selected images from a chest CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 14:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi erect technique.  There continues to be more focal nodular opacity
 in the right mid to lower lung as well some lateral pleural thickening, which
 when correlated with the CT dated ___, appears to predominantly
 correspond to a multiloculated pleural fluid collection and combination of
 atelectasis and pneumonia.  Lung volumes remain low.  Linear opacity in the
 left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
