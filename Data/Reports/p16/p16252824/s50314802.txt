                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and rhonchi.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___ chest
 radiographs, chest CT on ___:
 
 Lungs are low in volume, the only focal abnormalities are regions of
 persistent scarring or atelectasis at the lung bases.  There are no findings
 to suggest acute pneumonia or cardiac decompensation.  Osteolytic compression
 fractures in the mid thoracic spine are grossly unchanged since ___,
 but the lateral chest radiograph is not definitive in making comparisons. 
 Multiple myeloma also affects multiple ribs.  Detection of pathologic
 fractures is best obtained by either CT scanning or bone detail, conventional
 radiographs.
