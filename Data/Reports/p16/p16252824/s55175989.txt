 There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the cavoatrial
 junction.  There are low lung volumes.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  There are no pneumothoraces. There are
 several lytic expansile lesions within the ribs more confluent within the
 right upper chest which can be consistent with known multiple myeloma.  These
 appear unchanged.  Cystic lesions within the left proximal humerus are also
 seen.  Several compression deformities of the thoracic and lumbar spines are
 also seen.
