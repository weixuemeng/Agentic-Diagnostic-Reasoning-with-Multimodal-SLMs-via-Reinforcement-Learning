                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma, presenting with cough and abnormal labs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation. Heart size is normal
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There are coarsened interstitial markings with peripheral
 reticular opacities most suggestive of scarring in the mid to lower lungs,
 right > left.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 There are multiple mid thoracic vertebral compression fractures with
 accentuated kyphosis as well as chronic appearing right rib deformity at the
 ___ posterior arch. In addition, expansile lucent lesions of the ___ and ___
 right ribs are noted, concerning for myeloma. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Peripheral reticular opacities, most likely reflect scarring. Comparison
 with prior radiographs would aid in establishing the stability of this
 appearance. The possiblity of  infection is difficult to exclude in the
 correct clinical setting however.  
 2.  Osseous deformities and lucent lesions concerning for myeloma.
