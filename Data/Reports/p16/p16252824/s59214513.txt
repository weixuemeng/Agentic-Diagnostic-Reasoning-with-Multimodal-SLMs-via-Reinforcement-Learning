                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Multiple Myeloma, left rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right chest wall Port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Streaky scarring in the right middle and left upper
 lobe is again seen.  There are extensive expansile lytic rib lesions on the
 right greater than left consistent with healed rib fractures.  Compression
 deformities of multiple vertebral bodies are grossly unchanged.  No definite
 acute left-sided displaced rib fracture is seen.  Diffuse lytic lesions
 consistent with known multiple myeloma are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, similar appearance of the chest.  No definite acute rib fracture. 
 Given extensive myelomatous involvement, a CT should be considered, if
 clinically indicated, to better evaluate osseous structures.
