                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of multiple myeloma.  Presenting with cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___,
 and CT chest dated ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are noted to be low.  Bibasilar scarring is essentially
 unchanged as compared to the prior examination.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. 
 Redemonstrated is evidence of multiple myeloma affecting multiple bilateral
 ribs, as well as the thoracic spine.  Multiple resultatn pathologic
 compression fractures are again seen within the thoracic spine but were better
 characterized by the recent chest CT examination.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Osseous sequelae of multiple myeloma within bilateral ribs and the
 thoracic spine, with multiple resultant vertebral compression deformities.
