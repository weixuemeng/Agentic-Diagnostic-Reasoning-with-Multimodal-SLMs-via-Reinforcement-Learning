                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  Mild diffuse interstitial reticular abnormalities, mainly
 located in the lower lobes, are grossly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax,
 large effusion or new lung abnormalities.  There is improved aeration in the
 right lung.  Multiple osseous lesions are again noted.  Patient has known
 myeloma with unchanged wedge-shaped deformity of mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial abnormality with low lung volumes, likely chronic. 
 If clinically necessary, high-resolution CT could be performed for further
 evaluation.  Component of pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is minimally
 increased atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  Superimposed infection cannot
 be excluded.
