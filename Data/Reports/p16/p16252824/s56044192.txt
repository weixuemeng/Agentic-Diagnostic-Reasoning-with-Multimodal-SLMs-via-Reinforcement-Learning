                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, new chest tube  // eval for
 pneumo, chest tube placement      eval for pneumo, chest tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to chest radiograph dated ___ at 11:15 and
 selected images from a chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ 11:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter which appears to be
 kinked. No pneumothorax; however, the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 diminished given semi-erect technique.  Right mid to lower lung nodular
 opacity and lateral pleural thickening likely correspond to a combination of
 loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis and/ pneumonia when correlated with
 the chest CT dated ___.  No pulmonary edema.  Low lung volumes
 with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  Linear opacity in the left mid
 lung either reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
