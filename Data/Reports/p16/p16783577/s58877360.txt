  Diffuse bilateral airspace consolidations in the setting of recent
  cardiopulmonary arrest likely correspond to diffuse pulmonary edema. 
  Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea.  Enteric tube
  terminates in the left upper quadrant.  Right internal jugular central venous
  line terminates in the upper right atrium.  There is no evidence of
  pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.
