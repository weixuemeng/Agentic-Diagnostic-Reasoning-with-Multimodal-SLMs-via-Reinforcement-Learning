                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory distress  // please evaluate for
 pulmonary edema, infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina.  The right IJ
 central venous catheter is near the cavoatrial junction.  There is interval
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Perihilar and interstitial opacities
 have also increased with increased airspace opacification of the lower lobes. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and diffusely increased interstitial and
 bibasilar airspace opacities are consistent with worsening mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.
