                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with prior pneumothorax  // resolution of apical
 pneumothorax      resolution of apical pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous small right apical pneumothorax has resolved, and there is only a
 small residual right pleural effusion.  Upper thoracostomy tube still in
 position.  A small nodular opacity at the tip of the pleural drain could be an
 artifact of suction, or any small lesion in the lung such as a fluid-filled
 pneumatocele.  If it does not resolve, CT scanning might be helpful in
 assessment.  Left lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
