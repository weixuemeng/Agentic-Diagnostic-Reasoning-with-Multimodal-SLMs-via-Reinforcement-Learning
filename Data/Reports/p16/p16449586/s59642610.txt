                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with alcohol intoxication with low oxygen
 saturation.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette allowing for AP projection and low lung volumes. 
 Patient is slightly lordotic in position and right convex thoracic scoliosis
 and multiple rib deformities on the right are redemonstrated.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Linear opacities in the left greater
 than right base are consistent with atelectasis although aspiration could have
 a similar appearance.  There is no confluent consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis versus aspiration.  No confluent opacity
 to suggest pneumonia.
