                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ years old male patient with cough, evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Multiple old right-sided rib deformities
 related to trauma and a moderate right-sided scoliosis in the upper thoracic
 spine results in asymmetric presentation of the chest on frontal view.  These
 deformities existed already on previous examinations.  Heart size is within
 normal limits and there is no typical configurational abnormality. 
 Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Similar as described on previous examination, there exist some
 widespread increased interstitial markings mostly on the bases which, however,
 appear to be stable in comparison with previous examinations.  Pleural spaces
 are free.  No new acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of acute pneumonia in patient
 with history of cough.
