                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There are hazy bibasilar opacities
 suggestive of effusions.  Underlying atelectasis and consolidation are also
 possible.  Linear opacity in the left mid lung most suggestive of atelectasis.
 The cardiac silhouette appears grossly within normal limits for technique and
 low lung volumes.  Density projects over one of the lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies, from possible prior vertebroplasty.  IVC filter is partially
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy bibasilar opacities suggestive of effusions.  Presumed associated
 atelectasis and possible consolidation.
