                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes.  There is a tubular structure/catheter seen
 projecting over the right upper abdomen, not fully imaged.  There is a patchy
 opacity in the left lung, noted on chest CT from one day prior, better
 evaluated on that study.  Additionally, multiple sub-5-mm pulmonary nodules
 are also better evaluated on chest CT.  There is minimal right basilar
 atelectasis.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine, not optimally
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the left lung, noted on chest CT from one day
 prior, better evaluated on that study.  Additionally, multiple sub-5-mm
 pulmonary nodules are also better evaluated on chest CT.
