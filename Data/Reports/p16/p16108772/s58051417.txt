                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including tortuosity of the aorta and borderline cardiomegaly.  There is a
 mild interstitial abnormality suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy opacities are present at both lung bases, not specific although most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, atypical pneumonia could also be considered.  Also, although
 it is difficult to exclude focal pneumonia at the lung bases, patchy basilar
 opacities with low lung volumes could also be seen with atelectasis.
