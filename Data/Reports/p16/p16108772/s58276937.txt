                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with questionable CHF versus COPD flare,
 has rales on examination, compare with initial chest films from last week.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is now examined in upright position using PA and lateral
 chest views.  Marked right-sided convex scoliosis exists in the upper portion
 of the thoracic spine and results in the scoliosis-related rib deformities. 
 Patient's inspiration has improved dramatically with the diaphragms now being
 almost two rib intervals lower than on the previous study.  The heart size can
 now be assessed with greater accuracy, and the heart size is at most
 borderline.  There is a relative prominence of the left ventricle, a finding
 which in conjunction with the generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta
 speaks in favor of systemic hypertension.  Presently, however, there is no
 significant congestion in the pulmonary vasculature and no evidence of pleural
 effusion in either lateral or posterior pleural spaces exists.  No
 pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  As chest findings are now
 similar to what have been seen on a PA and lateral chest examination, the most
 recent event is likely to be caused by a flare in COPD rather than acute
 cardiovascular failure.
