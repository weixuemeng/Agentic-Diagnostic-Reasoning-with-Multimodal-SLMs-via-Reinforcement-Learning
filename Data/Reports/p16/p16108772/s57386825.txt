                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are low,
 accentuating the vascular structures.  There is a hazy opacity at the right
 base, which given the low lung volumes, is likely atelectasis, although in the
 proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged, and stable from the prior exam.  Tortuosity of the aorta is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Moderate upper
 thoracic dextroscoliosis is stable.  Rib deformities on the right reflect old
 healed injuries.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hazy opacification at the right base, in the setting of low lung volumes,
 is likely atelectasis.  In the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be
 completely excluded.
 
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
