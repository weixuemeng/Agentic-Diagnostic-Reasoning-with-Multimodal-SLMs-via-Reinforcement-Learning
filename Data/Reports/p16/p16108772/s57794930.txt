                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Marked
 tortuosity of thoracic aorta is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy opacity in
 the left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis. 
 Infection in the correct clinical setting cannot be completely excluded.
