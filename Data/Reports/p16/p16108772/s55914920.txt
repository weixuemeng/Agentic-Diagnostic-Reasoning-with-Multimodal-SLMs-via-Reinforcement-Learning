                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is patchy new left basilar opacity slightly silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm on the left; the lateral view in particular depicts a more
 widespread patchy opacity in the left lower lobe, however, for which
 atelectasis or pneumonia could be considered.  There is no definite effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe rightward convex curvature centered along
 the upper thoracic spine with associated deformities among the chest wall
 appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left lower lobe opacification, but potentially due to
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia or inflammatory process of lower airways could also be
 considered, however, as potential etiologies.
