                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF now with acute chest pain, here to evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The chest cage is distorted by moderate S-shaped scoliosis of the
 imaged thoracolumbar spine.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 edema, increased from the most recent prior study.  Retrocardiac opacification
 is unchanged, likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiac silhouette is accentuated by under-inflation of the lungs, but likely
 within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous causing prominence of
 the mediastinum, which is unchanged from prior studies.  The hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema, which is new from the most
 recent prior study.
