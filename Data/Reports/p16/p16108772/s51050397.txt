                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal views of the chest were provided.  There is a spinal
 scoliosis with apparent rib cage deformity which appears unchanged.  The lung
 volumes are low, with subtle reticular nodular opacities in the lower lungs
 which likely represent crowding of bronchial vasculature in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  Please note mild pulmonary vascular congestion would be
 difficult to exclude.  No large effusion is seen, though the left CP angle is
 excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle lower lung reticular nodular opacities which could
 represent bronchovascular crowding/atelectasis, much less likely pneumonia.
