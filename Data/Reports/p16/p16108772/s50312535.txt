                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged.  The same
 holds for the markedly generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  The on next previous chest examinations
 of ___ and ___, identified retrocardiac parenchymal
 densities have now cleared up completely.  As the patient has a significant
 right-sided convex scoliosis in the thoracic area, the retrocardiac
 parenchymal density could only be identified on the lateral view as the heart
 shadow was obscuring major portions of the retrocardiac area.  Comparison of
 the lateral views ascertains that the density has now been normalized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement but no evidence of advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema or pleural effusion. No remaining evidence of
 retro- cardiac parenchymal density observed on previous examinations.
