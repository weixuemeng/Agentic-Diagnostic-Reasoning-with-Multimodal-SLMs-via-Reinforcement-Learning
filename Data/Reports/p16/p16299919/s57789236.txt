                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and mild dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest, AP and lateral.  There is dense, somewhat linear opacity in the right
 lower lobe in a pattern similar to, but increased from the prior radiograph. 
 There is minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis however superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be fully excluded.  Given chronicity, CT should be considered to more
 fully evaluate.
 
 This recommendation was emailed to the ED QA nurses.
