                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with left basilar rhonchi.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 There is a vague area of increased opacification at the right base, which
 probably represents either a combination of vessels or mild atelectatic
 changes.  No evidence of left basilar consolidation, vascular congestion, or
 pleural effusion.
