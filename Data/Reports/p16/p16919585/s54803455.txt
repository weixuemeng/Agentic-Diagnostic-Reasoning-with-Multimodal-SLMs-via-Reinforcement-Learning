 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cabg  // evaluate sternal wires - noted
 for click
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The
 sternal wires are in unchanged position. The lateral radiograph reveals a
 retrosternal air-fluid level, likely caused by a pleural air accumulation with
 some remnant pleural fluid. The lateral radiograph also shows mild to moderate
 bilateral posterior pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema. No visible
 pneumothorax on the frontal image.
