                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with mvc, pain, evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild apparent cardiomegaly is likely exaggerated by AP technique
 interpretation anatomy, as there is borderline pectus excavatum.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. 
 There is no displaced rib fracture.  The sternomanubrial joint is obscured by
 overlying soft tissue structures, but the sternum and xiphoid process are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process.
 2. Apparent mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette may be artifactual. 
 Clinical correlation is requested.
 3. Sternomanubrial joint obscured by overlying soft tissues.
