                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough and wheezing.  Evaluate for acute infectious
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___, ___, and
 ___.  Also, CTA chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are
 slightly underinflated, but there is no focal airspace consolidation.  There
 are bibasilar opacities which likely reflect atalectasis.  The aorta is
 calcified and slightly unfolded, similar to prior.  There is no cardiomegaly. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine are
 similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with opacities at the lung bases which may
 reflect atalectasis but infection cannot be excluded. If indicated, a repeat
 radiograph with better inspiration may be obtained for improved assessment of
 the lung bases.
