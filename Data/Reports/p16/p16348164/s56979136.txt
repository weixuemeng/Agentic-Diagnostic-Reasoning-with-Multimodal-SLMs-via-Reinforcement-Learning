                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of repeated aspirations.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph and CT from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are even lower on the current
 examination as compared to recent prior.  Bilateral basilar airspace opacities
 persist.  Allowing for differences in technique and lower lung volumes, the
 overall severity and distribution of the opacities appear similar.  There is a
 probable residual small left pleural effusion as well.  No right effusion is
 seen.  Interstitial prominence may be related to mild superimposed edema or
 possibly due to bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are similar to prior and within normal limits.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes with persistent bibasilar opacities, likely
 similar to prior examination allowing for differences in technique and related
 to aspiration events.  Assessment for interval development of new
 consolidation is difficult due to low lung volumes and AP technique.  If there
 is ongoing clinical concern, dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs should
 be considered when the patient is clinically able.
