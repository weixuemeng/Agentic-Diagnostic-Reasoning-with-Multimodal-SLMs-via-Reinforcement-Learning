                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach.  The side hole
 is just distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Much of the outer portion of
 the left hemithorax has been excluded from the image.  Some pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is probably still present, and there is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour as on previous study.
