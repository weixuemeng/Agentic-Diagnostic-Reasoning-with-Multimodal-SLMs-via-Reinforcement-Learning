                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, somnolence and leukocytosis despite therapy. 
 Evaluate for any interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: An orogastric tube is present with the port terminating at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Left-sided PICC terminates in the distal superior
 vena cava.  Cholecystectomy clips are again noted.  A catheter projects over
 the soft tissues of the right neck, perhaps within the external jugular vein.
 
 There is improved aeration of the left lung base.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the left lung base.  Given the rapiditiy of
 improvement, the findings are most consistent with aspiration.
