 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minor basilar atelectasis may be present.  Cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
