  Post treatment changes in the right lung with associated right middle lobe
  atelectasis as seen on prior.  More conspicuous  left basilar opacity
  potentially due to atelectasis however new region of consolidation is
  possible.  Two-view chest x-ray may help further characterize.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Additional
 history of right lower lobe lung adenocarcinoma status post CyberKnife.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Posttreatment changes project over the
 right lower lung with fiducial marker and distortion of the underlying lung
 parenchyma with linear opacities.  Some of this is also attributed to the
 right middle lobe atelectasis identified on prior CT.  At the left lung base
 there also areas of relatively linear opacity obscuring the heart border. 
 Superiorly the lungs are clear.  No acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Post treatment changes in the right lung with associated right middle lobe
 atelectasis as seen on prior.  More conspicuous left basilar opacity
 potentially due to atelectasis however new region of consolidation is
 possible.  Two-view chest x-ray may help further characterize.
