                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental state.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Poor inspiratory effort.  There is patchy bibasilar atelectasis; that
 on the right is new while that on the left appears relatively stable from the
 prior radiograph.  As before, the left costophrenic sulcus is not particularly
 well seen on the PA radiograph.  Lateral radiograph again shows bony
 osteopenia and multilevel compression fractures.
 
 CONCLUSION:  New right-sided atelectasis.  Chronic left-sided atelectasis. 
 Somewhat limited study.  No definitive acute findings.
