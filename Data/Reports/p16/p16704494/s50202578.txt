                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer with hypoxia, for VQ scan.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is increased prominence of the pulmonary
 markings suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  In view of the
 hyperexpansion of the lungs, some of this could reflect chronic pulmonary
 disease.  No definite acute focal pneumonia.  Port-A-Cath remains in place.
