                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new OG placement, evaluate OG tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and into the stomach with the tip
 projecting at the level of the pylorus or first portion of the duodenum.  A
 left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged terminating in the low
 SVC.  The endotracheal tube terminates 8.5 cm from the carina, similar to the
 prior study.  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  A moderate
 left pleural effusion is unchanged.  A small to moderate right pleural
 effusion is partially imaged as the right costophrenic sulcus is excluded from
 the field of view.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema is
 similar.  A rounded density in the right upper quadrant may represent a small
 gallstone.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube terminates the level of the pylorus were the first portion of
 the duodenum.
 2. Unchanged low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Endotracheal tube remains 8.5 cm from the carina and should be advanced for
 optimal positioning.
