                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is
 borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There
 is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes without
 overt pulmonary edema. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multilevel degenerative changes are again
 noted in the thoracic spine with anterior bridging osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
