  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Asymmetric right apical density,
  potentially apical scarring however given asymmetry, nonurgent chest CT is
  suggested to exclude underlying mass lesion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with generalized weakness  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are effusion or edema.  Nodular densities projecting over the lung
 bases bilaterally are presumably nipple shadows.  There is asymmetric density
 projecting over the right lung apex, over the lateral right second rib when
 compared to the left.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The
 thoracic aorta is markedly ectatic.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Asymmetric right apical density,
 potentially apical scarring however somewhat asymmetric and mass lesion is not
 excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Nonurgent chest CT.
