                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo male with chronic back pain on methadone s/p MVC with
 sternal fracture, multiple rib fractures, right hemothorax s/p CT placement,
 T11-___ fracture, intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
 multiple rib and sternal fractures, now being treated for HCAP.  // eval PICC
 placement   eval PICC placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___, read in
 conjunction with the torso CT on ___.
 
 Patient has been extubated and radiographic positioning has changed, but it is
 safe to say that there is still marked elevation of the base of the aerated
 right lung.  There is probably still substantial right pleural effusion and
 collapse of the lower lobe, and some atelectasis in the middle lobe.  Left
 lower lobe is still consolidated.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but there
 is no edema.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured, but
 probably unchanged acutely.
 
 Right upper thoracostomy tube in place.  Right PIC line is looped outside the
 chest in the right axilla.
 
 .
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is clinical justification for better assessment
 of the nature of bibasilar consolidation in the volume of pleural fluid, CT
 scanning, ideally with intravenous contrast, would be required.
