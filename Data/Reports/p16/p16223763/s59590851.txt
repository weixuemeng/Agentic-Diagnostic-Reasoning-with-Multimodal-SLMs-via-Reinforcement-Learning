                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hyponatremia  // evaluate for mass, acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  There is a
 focal opacity at the periphery of the left upper lobe projecting over the
 anterior second rib.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal opacity at the periphery of the left upper lobe projecting over the
 anterior second rib.  This may represent a consolidation although it is
 difficult to evaluate given low lung volumes.  Repeat AP and lateral views
 with better inspiration is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat study with AP and lateral view to distinguish
 between consolidation versus possible rib lesion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr.___ by Dr.___ ___ phone at 9:45am
