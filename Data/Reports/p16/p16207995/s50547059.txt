                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mantle cell lymphoma, recent pneumonia, question fluid overload. 
 Worsening effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The patient is probably kyphotic.  In addition, there are low inspiratory
 volumes and the left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The gastric fundus can be
 seen projecting over the cardiac silhouette, which seems to be a function of
 the elevated left hemidiaphragm.  There is negligible pleural fluid and no
 CHF.  There is atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes, slightly worse than on the prior
 film, though these are likely accentuated by patient kyphosis and elevated
 hemidiaphragms.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for more
 complete assessment.  No obvious effusions.  The possibility of a subpulmonic
 effusion would be difficult to exclude on this film.
