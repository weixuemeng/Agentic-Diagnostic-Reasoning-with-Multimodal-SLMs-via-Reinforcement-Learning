                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain, evaluate lungs.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is a right subclavian PICC line with its tip likely within the proximal
 superior vena cava.  Lung volumes remain low with persistent elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm and patchy bibasilar opacities which could reflect
 atelectasis and/or lobar collapse, less likely bibasilar pneumonia.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning and technique between studies.
