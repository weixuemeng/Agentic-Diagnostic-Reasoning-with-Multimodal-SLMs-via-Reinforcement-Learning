                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with NHL and PE.  Worsening cough and mild
 hypoxia.
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is markedly elevated, attributable to severe splenomegaly. 
 Small nodular opacities in the lungs are most readily visible in the axillary
 region of the right at the level of the third and fourth anterior ribs, but
 more numerous on the chest CTs performed concurrently, reported separately. 
 Atelectasis at the left lung base is due to hemidiaphragm elevation, which
 also partially obscures normal cardiac silhouette.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion.
