                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fevers, on chemotherapy, evaluate
 for interval change in form of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  As before, heart size cannot be evaluated
 because of obscuring structures with patient and elevated left-sided
 hemidiaphragm.  No significant interval change can be identified with the
 preceding portable chest examination of ___.  Thus, no evidence of new
 pulmonary abnormalities in comparison of these two portable chest examinations
 with one day examination interval.
