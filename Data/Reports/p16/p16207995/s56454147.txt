  LUE PICC in the proximal SVC Low lung volumes, bibasal opacities, increasing
  left basal opacity, may represent pneumonia. PA and lateral radiographs can be
  obtained for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Left PICC tip is in the proximal SVC.  Bibasilar opacities have worsened; this
 could be due to worsening bibasilar atelectases, but pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are probably
 unchanged.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  There are low lung volumes.
