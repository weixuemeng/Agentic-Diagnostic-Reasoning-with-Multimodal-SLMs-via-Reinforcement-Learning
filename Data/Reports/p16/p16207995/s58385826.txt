                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Thrombocytopenia and elevated liver function tests.  Possible
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is markedly elevated.  There could be severe splenomegaly
 or other mass effect in the left upper abdominal quadrant.  Both pulmonary
 hila are mildly enlarged.  The contour in the right suggests mild enlargement
 of the pulmonary artery.  On the left, there could be adenopathy as well, but
 there is no extensive mediastinal adenopathy.  Heart size is normal.  There is
 no pleural effusion.  Slight indentation in the cervical trachea could be due
 to a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland.  Clinical correlation
 advised.
