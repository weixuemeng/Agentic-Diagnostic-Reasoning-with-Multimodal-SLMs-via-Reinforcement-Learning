                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and worsening desaturation, to assess for pulmonary edema
 after fluids.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is
 increased bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  This could well reflect
 overhydration in a patient with multifocal pneumonia.
