                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, increased blood sugar  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Despite that, there is likely mild pulmonary edema given
 prominent interstitial markings and new peribronchial cuffing.  Bibasilar
 subsegmental atelectasis is present. Blunting of the costophrenic angles on
 the frontal radiograph is likely due to prominent overlying soft tissues. The
 heart mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed.  Marked thoracic spine
 kyphosis with extensive multilevel degeneration is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
