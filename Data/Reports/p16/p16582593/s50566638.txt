 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis
 which is likely due to poor inspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hyperlucency in the left apex may represent tiny pneumothorax,
 but can be further evaluated with an expiratory view.
