 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stable
 with a calcified, somewhat tortuous aorta.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions
 may be present.  There is prominence of the interstitial markings diffusely
 and bilaterally, as also seen on prior studies, suggesting mild interstitial
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is chronic severe compression of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation.
