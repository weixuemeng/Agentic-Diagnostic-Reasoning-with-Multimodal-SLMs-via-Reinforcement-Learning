                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal
 contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is worsening pulmonary edema, now
 moderate in extent.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction
 is unchanged.  There are multilevel degenerative changes within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, worse compared to the prior study with probable
 small pleural effusions bilaterally.  No mediastinal widening.  If there is
 continued concern for aortic dissection, please note that a chest CTA is
 recommended.
