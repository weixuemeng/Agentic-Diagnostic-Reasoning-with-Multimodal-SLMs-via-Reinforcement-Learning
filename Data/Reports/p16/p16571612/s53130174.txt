                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Interval left subclavian line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the same date obtained approximately 1.5 hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided subclavian
 central venous catheter with tip projecting over the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  An endotracheal tube and an esophageal catheter are in
 unchanged position.  Again seen are diffuse ill-defined bibasilar opacities,
 as well as more reticular opacities with bronchiectasis consistent with
 chronic fibrotic change.  No significant pleural effusion is seen.  The heart
 size is normal.
