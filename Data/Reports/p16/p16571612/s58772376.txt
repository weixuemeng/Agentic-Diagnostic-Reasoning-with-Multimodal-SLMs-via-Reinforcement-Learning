                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and elevated white blood cell count.  Intubated at outside
 hospital.  Evaluation of endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.  Review of subsequent CT
 of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities at the lung bases.  More
 reticular opacities are consistent with chronic fibrotic changes.  No supine
 evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.  The heart size is
 within normal limits.  An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip
 approximately 3 cm above the carina.  An esophageal catheter is in place with
 tip and side port within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hazy opacities at the lung bases with chronic fibrotic changes.  Given
 clinical presentation and fever, acute superimposed pneumonia is a concern on
 this radiograph, though is not clearly confirmed on the subsequent CT.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube and esophageal catheter in standard positions.
