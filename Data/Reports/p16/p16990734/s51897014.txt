                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with respiratory distress  // ? acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and increased interstitial markings
 likely represent mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  There are likely small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect dependent
 pulmonary edema.  The heart remains enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by interstitial edema.  More confluent basilar
 opacities may reflect dependent edema, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia
 should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
