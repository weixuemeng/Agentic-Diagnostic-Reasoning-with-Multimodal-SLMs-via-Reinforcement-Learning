                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of chf with doe  // eval edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, CT C-spine dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated
 with a small left pleural effusion. Associated opacity at the left lung base
 most likely represents atelectasis versus pneumonia. There is no overt edema.
 Mediastinal contour is normal. A calcified nodular structure again seen
 projecting over the right upper lung likely costochondral calcification, as
 partially seen on a CT C-spine from ___. No convincing signs of edema. No
 pneumothorax. Bony structures are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with basal opacity likely atelectasis versus
 pneumonia. Stable cardiomegaly.
