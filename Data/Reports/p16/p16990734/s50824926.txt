                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF and COPD p/w acute SOB  // e/o
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Even allowing for the projection, there is mild cardiomegaly.  There is
 persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.  Increased opacity at the right lung
 base is more conspicuous than on the prior study.  Given the lack of
 associated volume loss, appearances are suspicious for superimposed infection.
 There is persistent prominence of the bilateral hila with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Background changes of atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base suspicious for superimposed
 infection.
