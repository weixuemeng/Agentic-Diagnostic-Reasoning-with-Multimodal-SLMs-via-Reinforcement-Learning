                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath.  Evaluate for infiltrate or
 edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided.  There is
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings, likely
 representing mild pulmonary edema.  There are bilateral pleural effusions,
 small on the right and moderate on the left.  Right basilar opacities may
 again be due to pulmonary edema; however, infection is also possible.  The
 heart remains enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 
 2.  Right basilar opacity which may be also edema; however, infection cannot
 be excluded.
