 device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, and endotracheal
 tube terminating in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, approximately 6.5 cm
 from the carina, and an enteric tube terminating in the stomach.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and the lungs are well
 expanded without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Widened right AC joint is compatible with grade 3 injury, of unclear
 chronicity.

 upper thoracic trachea, approximately 6.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 tip within the stomach.
