                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with falls, chest pain, upper and lower back pain, ABD pain
 with vomiting.  Eval for acute injury, gross aortic pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, there are continued low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 unchanged and unremarkable.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal consolidation.  Unchanged appearance of thoracic aorta.  However,
 considering concern for aortic pathology, dedicated CTA of the chest may be
 considered if warranted clinically.
