                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 left cardiac border is obscured which usually indicates opacity in the
 lingula, but this appearance is fairly similar to the prior examination and
 probably represents minor scarring or atelectasis of doubtful significance. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is similar mild relative
 elevation of the anteromedial right hemidiaphragm.  The patient is also status
 post incompletely characterized lower anterior cervical fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
