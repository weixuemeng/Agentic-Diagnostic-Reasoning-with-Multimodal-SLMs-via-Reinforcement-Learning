                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with abnormal electrolytes and altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and normal
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  A ring-like opacity seen only on
 the lateral view is likely a confluence of shadows, however shallow-oblique
 radiographs should be obtained to exclude the possibility of a cavitary lung
 lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Ring-like opacity seen only on the lateral view is likely a confluence of
 shadows, however steep oblique radiographs (___ and ___) should be obtained to
 exclude the possibility of a cavitary lung lesion.
 
 Note:  Impression #2 was emailed to the Emergency Department Quality Assurance
 Nursing group for follow-up, since the patient was discharged from the ED at
 the time of attending review.
