                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Recent ST elevation myocardial infarction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The left posterior costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded
 making it difficult to exclude a pleural effusion.  There is probably a trace
 pleural effusion, however, detectable on the left side.  A small round
 hyperdense focus in the right mid lung is most consistent with a nipple
 shadow, or perhaps less likely a possibly calcified pulmonary nodule. 
 Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Probable nipple shadow on the
 right; when clinically appropriate confirmation with an additional PA view
 including nipple markers is recommended.
