 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a previously identified right-sided PICC
 line. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged in position.
 A loculated right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size, now
 mild-moderate. Additionally, a small right basilar pleural effusion is
 slightly larger. Focal airspace in the right middle lobe has increased. No
 evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac size is within normal limits. Aortic
 knob calcifications are again noted.

 1. Increased right middle lobe airspace opacity, suggestive of aspiration
 versus pneumonia.
 2. Increased right basilar and right loculated pleural effusions, now
 small-moderate.
