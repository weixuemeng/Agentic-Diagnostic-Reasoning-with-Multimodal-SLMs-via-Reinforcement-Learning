                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Semi-erect, portable frontal chest radiographs again demonstrate a right PICC
 with the tip in the mid SVC and multiple sternal wires.  Lung volumes are low,
 with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding. There is increased opacity at the right lung base, which could
 represent a small pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, but
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is also mild pulmonary edema.
 There is a small amount of pleural fluid seen within the left fissure.
 Retrocardiac opacity is likely secondary to atelectasis, and is slightly
 increased compared to the prior chest radiograph. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right base opacity, which could represent a combination of small right
 pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, but a superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded. Retrocardiac/ left base opacity is likely related to
 atelectasis.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
