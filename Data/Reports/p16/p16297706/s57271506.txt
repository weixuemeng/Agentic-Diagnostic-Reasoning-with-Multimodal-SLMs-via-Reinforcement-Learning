                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral loculated pleural effusions s/p
 b/l chest tube placement  // Please eval for interval change in b/l pleural
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC ends in the mid to low SVC. Bilateral pigtail catheters project
 over the lung bases. Sternotomy wires are redemonstrated. There is a
 cholecystostomy tube in place.
 
 Rounded opacities throughout the right lung correspond to loculated pleural
 fluid, as seen on the CT from ___.  There is no definite residual
 left pleural effusion. There is either band like atelectasis within the right
 mid lung or a small amount of fluid in the minor fissure. There is mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 A tiny left apical pneumothorax has nearly resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Residual mutliloculated right pleural effusion.
 2. Resolution of left-sided pleural effusion.
 3. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 4. Near resolution of tiny left apical pneumothorax.
