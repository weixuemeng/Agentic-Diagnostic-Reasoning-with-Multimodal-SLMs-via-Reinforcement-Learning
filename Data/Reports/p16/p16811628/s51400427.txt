                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and chills, dry cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Airspace
 consolidation is seen within the right upper lobe and right middle lobe
 concerning for pneumonia.  Left lung mostly clear, though mild lower lung
 opacity may represent additional site of pneumonia.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense consolidation within the right upper lobe and portions of
 the right middle and left lower lobes compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
