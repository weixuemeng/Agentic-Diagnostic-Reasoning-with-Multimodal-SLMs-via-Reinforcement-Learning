                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible infectious process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the right base medially.  This was in an area of previous
 pneumonia and could represent substantial clearing or possibly reoccurrence. 
 The area of increased opacification at the left upper zone has essentially
 cleared.  Old healed rib fractures are again seen.  Probable calcified
 granuloma is seen in the left apex.
