                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lateral decubitus chest radiograph was obtained to evaluate
 for possible right pneumothorax.  It demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax.
 Additional AP semi-erect chest radiograph is submitted for review and
 demonstrates apparent worsening of bilateral heterogeneous airspace opacities,
 as well as widening of the vascular pedicle.  Observed rapid change in
 opacities could potentially represent pulmonary edema superimposed upon a
 known history of pneumonia.  Rounded lucencies are again demonstrated within
 the areas of consolidation in the mid and lower right lung regions, and could
 reflect areas of spared lung parenchyma or cavitation.
