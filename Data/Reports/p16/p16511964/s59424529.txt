                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Widespread bilateral
 pulmonary opacities appear slightly improved, which may in part be due to
 differences in lung volumes between the studies.  Right hemidiaphragm contour
 appears unusually sharp, a finding that can be seen in the setting of a
 basilar pneumothorax, although no discrete visceral pleural line is evident to
 confirm this diagnosis.  If warranted clinically, a left lateral decubitus
 radiograph of the right lung could be performed to confirm or exclude right
 pneumothorax or free intraperitoneal air, as communicated to Dr. ___ by
 phone on ___ at 8:11 a.m. at the time of discovery.
