                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening NPH symptoms for 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Evaluation of the lung bases is
 somewhat limited due to the presence of low lung volumes, with patchy
 opacities at the bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Mild
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
