                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // please evaluate for acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is
 borderline enlarged, likely exaggerated due to technique.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unremarkable given lordotic technique.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No definite focal consolidation is
 identified, however, the lateral film is considerably motion degraded, which
 limits evaluation.  No gross effusion.  Small posterior effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.  Note made of old healed rib fractures on both the left
 and right sides.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute intrathoracic abnormality.  No frank consolidation is
 identified, though patchy basilar infiltrates would be difficult to exclude on
 these images.
