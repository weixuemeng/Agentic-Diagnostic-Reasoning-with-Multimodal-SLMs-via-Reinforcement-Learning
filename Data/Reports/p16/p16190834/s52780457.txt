                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  Irregular opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle
 likely represents combination of basal atelectasis in conjunction with
 crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Evidence of
 multiple old left posterolateral rib fractures, at least involving ribs 6, 7,
 and 8, are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Multilevel old left posterolateral rib
 fractures.
