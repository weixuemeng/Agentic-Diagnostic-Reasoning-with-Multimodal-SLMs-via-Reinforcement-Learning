 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, no
 pulmonary edema is seen. Subtle right basilar opacity likely represents
 crowding of vascular structures. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
