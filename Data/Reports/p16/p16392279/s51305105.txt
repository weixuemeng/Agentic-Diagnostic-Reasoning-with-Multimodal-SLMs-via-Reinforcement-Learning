                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New right internal jugular line placement, here to evaluate line
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous line is in place.  There is
 sharp angulation at two points in the catheter in its course within the soft
 tissues of the neck.  The tip terminates at the level of the brachiocephalic
 vein.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low, but
 the lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia or a pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is gasless.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of kinking within the right internal jugular venous
 catheter which may obstruct function.  Recommend repositioning.  Otherwise,
 unremarkable radiograph of the chest.
