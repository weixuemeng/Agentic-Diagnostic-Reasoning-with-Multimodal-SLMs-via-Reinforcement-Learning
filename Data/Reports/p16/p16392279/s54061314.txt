                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status and low oxygen saturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, perihilar opacities may relate to pulmonary edema.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, underlying infection is not excluded.  There are no large
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are likely accentuated by the low lung volumes and AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, perihilar opacities and prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 is most likely due to pulmonary edema.  Underlying infectious process is
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, consider repeat
 after any diuresis.
