                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral knee pain and chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has been near
 complete resolution of previous right lung basal pneumonia and mild edema, but
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists even though heart size is normal
 and there is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near complete resolution of previous right lower (and posssible middle) lobe
 pneumonia.  Resolved edema, normal heart size, but chronic vascular
 overcirculation persists, can be due to tachycardia or otherwise hyperdynamic
 circulation.
