                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Central line placement, confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:18.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter which terminates in the mid SVC.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight prominence of the
 hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Perihilar opacities,
 improved since the prior study, perhaps in part due to deeper inspiration. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminating in the mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Interval decrease in perihilar opacities in part be due to deeper inspiration
 or decrease in fluid overload with mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement/congestion remaining.
