 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The patient has a large hiatal hernia. The Dobhoff tube tip ends in the
 stomach just distal to the hiatal hernia, however the radiolucent portion of
 the tube is within the hiatal hernia. This should be advanced prior to use.
  Again seen is opacity projecting over the right chest compatible with
 alveolar edema, fluid in the fissure, and likely also some fluid accumulating
 in the chest. This is similar in appearance compared to prior. An underlying
 infectious infiltrate can't be excluded
