                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of 3
 exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear opacity in the left mid lung zone is new from the prior
 exam, and likely represents atelectasis.  There is persistent scarring at the
 right base with a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening, which has
 slightly increased in size since the prior exam.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Apical scarring and pleural thickening
 appears stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left mid lung atelectasis.
 2.  Minimal interval increase in the amount of right pleural thickening. 
 Stable right basilar parenchymal scarring.
 3.  No evidence of a fracture.
