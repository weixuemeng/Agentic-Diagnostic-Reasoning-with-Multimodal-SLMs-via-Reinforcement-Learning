                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with COPD, cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear hyperexpanded suggestive of chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease. A focal nodule is noted posterior to the sternum.
 Additionally, there is enlargement of the left main pulmonary artery.  Cardiac
 silhouette is normal.  Bibasilar opacities are visualized likely
 representative of bronchiectasis and fibrosis.  Calcifications of the origin
 of the great vessels are noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. There are bibasilar parenchymal opacities likely representative of chronic
 scarring. 
 2. There is a small retrosternal nodule. Follow up with CT is recommended. 
 3. Left pulmonary artery appears prominent suggestive of pulmonary artery
 hypertension or pulmonic stenosis.
