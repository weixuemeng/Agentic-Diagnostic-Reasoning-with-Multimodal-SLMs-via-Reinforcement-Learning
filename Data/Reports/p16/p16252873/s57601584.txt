 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued right pleural
 effusion that may be slightly worse or merely reflecting slight difference in
 patient position.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size
 in this patient, who has intact midline sternal wires following previous CABG
 procedure.  No definite vascular congestion at this time.
