                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is interval increase in
 currently moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Post-sternotomy wires are stable.  The slight right mediastinal
 shift is consistent with the presence of atelectasis underlying the pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
