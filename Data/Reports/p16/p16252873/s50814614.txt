                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumothorax or hemothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right
 pigtail catheter remains in place and there is a small apical pneumothorax. 
 Little change in the small pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at
 the right base.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with evidence
 of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
