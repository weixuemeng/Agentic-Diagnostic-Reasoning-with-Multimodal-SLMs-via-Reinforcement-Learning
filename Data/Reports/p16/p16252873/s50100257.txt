                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small-to-moderate right hydropneumothorax has increased since ___. 
 Consolidation in the right lower lobe, best appreciated on the lateral view in
 the anterior medial basal segments is unlikely to have been traumatized during
 thoracentesis unless a lateral approach was used.  Whether this lung lesion
 needs to be investigated depends upon the nature of the pleural fluid
 aspirated, particularly its cytology and status as a possible exudate.
 
 Left lung is clear.  Small left pleural effusion evident only on the lateral
 view is probably not new.  Heart size top normal.
