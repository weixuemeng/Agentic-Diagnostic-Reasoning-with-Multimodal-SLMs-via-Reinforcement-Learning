                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with bilateral rales and pleuritic chest
 pain, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest is provided.  No pneumothoraces are
 seen.  Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. At the left lower lobe, there is an ill-defined opacity which
 could be consistent with an infectious process in the correct clinical
 setting, or aspiration. There is mild right basilar atelectasis.   
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill defined left lower lobe opacity, possibly infection versus
 aspiration.
