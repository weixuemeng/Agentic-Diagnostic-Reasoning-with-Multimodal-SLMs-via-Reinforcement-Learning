                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained the same day earlier at 02:36 a.m.
 
 AP chest radiograph was reviewed.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is substantial improvement up to almost
 complete resolution of severe pulmonary edema.  Still present small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted, left more than right.  Questionable infectious
 process in the left lower lobe potentially can be suspected, followup with
 chest radiograph is recommended to establish complete resolution of this still
 present asymmetric left lower lobe opacity.
