                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia and hypertension.  Query infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  There is probably a normal heart size allowing for projection. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions much larger on the left side.  There is a small
 amount of bronchial wall thickening and irregularity in the retrocardiac
 region on the left, probably reflects some atelectasis.  There is some
 bronchial wall thickening on the right side also identified.  The left
 subclavian stent is identified.  Heavy vascular calcification is noted.
 
 Reference to prior studies is made.  When compared to the most recent study,
 there is probably less overall congestive change, but this has revealed the
 lower lobe bronchial wall thickening.  This is nonspecific, may reflect either
 failure or a bronchial infection.  There is no pneumonia.  The left lower lobe
 effusion may be marginally bigger than on the prior study.
