 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is limited by patient's inability to cooperate and the lateral
 view is nondiagnostic.  Stable prominence of the interstitium likely due to
 reported history of COPD.  No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia
 identified on the frontal radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definitive acute intrathoracic process.  If continued concern,
 could repeat conventional radiograph with lateral view.
