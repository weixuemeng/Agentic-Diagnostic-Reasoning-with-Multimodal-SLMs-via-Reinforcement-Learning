                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain of the L-spine status post fall.  Evaluate for traumatic
 injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is seen with bilateral interstitial vascular markings
 consistent with mild edema.  The lungs do not have any pleural effusions,
 focal opacities or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits. No rib fractures or acute vertebral height loss is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No displaced
 fractures seen, but if there is continued concern for a rib fracture, then a
 dedicated rib series is suggested.
