  1.  Area of opacity right lung base, which could represent atelectasis but
  which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical
  setting.
  
  2. No definite rib fracture, although standard chest radiographs are
  insensitive for a rib fractures.  If concern for fracture persists, dedicated
  rib films with sites of focal tenderness marked with a BB would allow for
  better assessment.
  
  3.  Chronic prominent interstitial markings, similar prior exams.
  
  Findings communicated to Dr. ___ at 10:02 a.m. on ___ by phone.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall and chest wall pain  // presence of rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to prior exams with associated slightly
 increased bronchovascular crowding. Chronic prominent interstitial markings
 are again seen, similar to prior exams.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  Possible right basilar atelectasis. Subtle right basilar patchy opacity
 may be due to atelectasis, underlying subtle consolidation due to aspiration,
 contusion, or pneumonia not excluded. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  No definite
 rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle right basilar patchy opacity may be due to atelectasis, underlying
 subtle consolidation due to aspiration, contusion, or pneumonia not excluded.
 
 2. No definite rib fracture, although standard chest radiographs are
 insensitive for a rib fractures. If concern for fracture persists, dedicated
 rib films with sites of focal tenderness marked with a BB or CT is more
 sensitive.
 
 3.  Chronic prominent interstitial markings, similar prior exams.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings communicated to Dr. ___ at 10:02 a.m. on ___ by phone.
