                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Schizophrenia, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, presents with
 hypoxia, being treated for pneumonia and COPD, UTI, question new cause of
 hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  The
 patient has been intubated with the tip of the ET tube located at least 2.7 cm
 above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is also seen with its tip in the left
 upper abdomen.  Since the prior exam, there has been interval development of
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, predominantly ground-glass and nodular,
 most likely indicative of pulmonary edema.  In addition, there are likely
 small bilateral effusions, hilar engorgement is also noted.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation and NG tube placement with appropriate
 position of tube.  Interval development of pulmonary edema with probable small
 bilateral effusions.
