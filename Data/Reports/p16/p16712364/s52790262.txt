                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and hypoxia.  Evaluate for fluid overload and/or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest was
 acquired.  Lung volumes are slightly low, decreased compared to the prior
 study.  Left retrocardiac consolidative opacification and right lower lung
 patchy opacities are increased compared to the prior study, possibly secondary
 to atelectasis, although an infectious process could have a similar
 appearance.  Mild perihilar fullness is suggestive of mild vascular
 congestion.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal size.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 suspected.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, possibly secondary to
 atelectasis, although aspiration pneumonitis and/or pneumonia could have a
 similar appearance.  Clinical correlation recommended.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
