                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with mild dyspnea, incr O2 requirement, hx COPD and
 CHF  // Acute CP process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild pulmonary edema. 
 Asymmetrical right basilar opacity may reflect asymmetrical edema and less
 likely a ease superimposed pneumonia. . Prominence of the hila is again noted
 and reflects a combination of enlarged pulmonary arteries and lymphadenopathy
 as seen on prior CT scan. Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also seen to
 better detail on that study. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful
 to exclude the possibility of coexisting right lower lobe pneumonia
 2.  Enlargement of bilateral hila reflecting a combination of enlarged
 pulmonary arteries and lymphadenopathy.
