                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with overdose, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with similar enlargement of the hila bilaterally. Mild pulmonary
 edema is slightly worse in the interval, somewhat exaggerated due to the
 presence of low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is noted.  No pleural
 effusion appears to be present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Unchanged enlargement of both hila, compatible with
 hilar lymphadenopathy and enlarged pulmonary arteries.
