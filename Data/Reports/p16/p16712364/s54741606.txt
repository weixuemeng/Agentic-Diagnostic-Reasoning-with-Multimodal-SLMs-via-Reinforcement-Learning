 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, leukopenia, questionable infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has increased.  There is a general bilateral increase of
 interstitial markings and the lateral radiograph shows subtle fluid markings
 of the interstitium.  There are no air bronchograms or pleural effusions.  The
 hilar structures are borderline in diameter.  Overall, the image is suggestive
 of mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  No additional areas of
 consolidation, evocative of pneumonia, are visible on the radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax.
