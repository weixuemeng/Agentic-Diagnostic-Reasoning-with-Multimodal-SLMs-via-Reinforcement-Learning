                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ventricular tachycardia, ICD on
 amiodarone, evaluate for infiltrate related to amiodarone toxicity.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  On the present frontal view, the patient
 makes a very poor inspirational effort resulting in high positioned diaphragms
 and thereto related crowded appearance of the basal pulmonary vasculature. 
 Heart size is not increased and no pulmonary vascular congestion has
 developed.  As before, a permanent pacer is located in left anterior axillary
 position being connected to a total of three intracavitary electrodes.  One of
 these is an ICD device that terminates in the right ventricle.  A second line
 is a probably abandoned old right ventricular electrode.  A third electrode
 terminates in the right atrium lateral posterior wall area and is located in
 unchanged position and comparison is made with the previous examination one
 and a half years ago.  Appearance of lungs is unchanged paying attention to
 differences in inspiratory degree.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates or
 interstitial fibrosis changes cannot be identified.  No pneumothorax is seen
 in the apical area.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no significant interval change since
 ___.  No suspicious findings for amiodarone toxicity.
