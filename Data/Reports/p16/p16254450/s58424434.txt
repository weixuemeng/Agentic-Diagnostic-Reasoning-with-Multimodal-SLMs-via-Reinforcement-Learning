  Lower lung volumes accentuate mild pulmonary edema. Unchanged cardiomegaly
  with retrocardiac opacification likely a combination of effusion and
  atelectasis although superimposed pneumonia is possible. Interval removal of
  left internal jugular sheath. Unchanged position of right internal jugular
  central venous catheter.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p Asc.Ao. dissection desaturating  //
 ?pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary
 edema have mildly increased in severity. These increase might be emphasized by
 the overall decrease in lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The
 venous introduction sheet on the left has been removed.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
