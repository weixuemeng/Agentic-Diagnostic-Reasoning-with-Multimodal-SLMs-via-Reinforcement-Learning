                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, new diagnosis is myeloma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rightward shift of mediastinal structures with volume loss in the right lung
 is re- demonstrated. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again
 noted along with a moderate size hiatal hernia. The mediastinal contour is
 similar with the lobulated contour of the aortic arch compatible with known
 thrombosed aneurysm.  Moderate circumferential pleural thickening is again
 demonstrated involving the right hemithorax along with a moderate size right
 pleural effusion, not substantially changed in the interval. Right basilar
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis. Left lung is grossly clear without new
 focal consolidation. No pneumothorax is detected. No pulmonary edema is
 visualized.  Numerous compression deformities are seen again within the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior exam. Redemonstration of right
 pleural thickening and moderate size right pleural effusion with associated
 right basilar atelectasis. Unchanged lobulated contour of the aortic arch
 compatible with thrombosed aneurysm. Moderate hiatal hernia. No new focal
 consolidation.
