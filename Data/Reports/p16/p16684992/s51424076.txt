 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:49 AM
  
  1. Stable right pleural margin thickening, consistent with known pleural-based
  abnormality.
  2. Stable chronic right lung volume loss and right basilar opacity, possibly
  scarring, atelectasis, or underlying mass. Interval resolution of right mid
  lung air-fluid level. Possible superimposed right pleural effusion.
  3. Progression of multiple lower thoracic vertebral compression deformities,
  age indeterminate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with a history of a right-sided pleural
 abnormality on prior CT, here with shortness of breath, evaluate for effusion
 or mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is thickening of the right
 pleural margin, consistent with known right-sided pleural-based abnormality.
 The right mid lung air-fluid level is no longer seen. Chronic right basilar
 opacity, possibly representing scarring, atelectasis, or underlying mass, and
 chronic volume loss of the right lung are overall not appreciably changed
 since ___, and are better assessed by CT. There may be a superimposed
 right pleural effusion. A hiatus hernia is seen. Multiple compression
 deformities involving the lower thoracic vertebrae are worsened since
 ___ and ___, age indeterminate. There is no left pleural
 effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable right pleural margin thickening, consistent with known pleural-based
 abnormality.
 2. Stable chronic right lung volume loss and right basilar opacity, possibly
 scarring, atelectasis, or underlying mass. Interval resolution of right mid
 lung air-fluid level. Possible superimposed right pleural effusion.
 3. Progression of multiple lower thoracic vertebral compression deformities,
 age indeterminate.
