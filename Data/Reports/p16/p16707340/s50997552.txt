                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  Within the limitations of
 technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within
 within normal limits.  Mild left basilar atelectasis is suspected but
 otherwise lungs appear clear within the limitations of technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
