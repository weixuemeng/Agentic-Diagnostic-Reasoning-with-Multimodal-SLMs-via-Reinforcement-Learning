                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nonspecific complaints.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Aside from streaky opacification of the right costophrenic sulcus suggesting
 minor atelectasis or scarring, the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion.  There is an eventration of the right hemidiaphragm with
 associated left basilar opacity which is probably attributable to associated
 atelectasis.  Scoliosis appears unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basilar opacities most suggestive of atelectasis with no
 definite evidence for acute disease.
