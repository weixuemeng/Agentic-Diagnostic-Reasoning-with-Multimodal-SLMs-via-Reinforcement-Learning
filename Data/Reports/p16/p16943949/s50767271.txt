 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  An endotracheal tube remains in place with the
 tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  There is a worsening area of focal
 opacity at the right lung base which may represent an evolving pneumonia,
 although patchy atelectasis would also be in the differential.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
