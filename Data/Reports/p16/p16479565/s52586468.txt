                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new ETT  // ETT placement? OG tube placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 30 minutes prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The nasogastric tube has been repositioned from the left lower lobe bronchus
 to the stomach, and passes out of view.  Endotracheal tube ends 3 cm above the
 carina in standard position.  A 3 cm long catheter projecting over the left
 upper is not identified.  It should be sought on subsequent studies to make
 sure it is not internal.
 
 Right infrahilar consolidation is either pneumonia or atelectasis. Severe
 cardiomegaly has particular large atria, and the mitral annulus is extremely
 heavily calcified, but there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema, or
 mediastinal venous distenstion.   A right skin fold should not be mistaken for
 pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is small if any.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 3 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube ends
 in the stomach.
 
 Small region of right lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly, predominantly biatrial .
