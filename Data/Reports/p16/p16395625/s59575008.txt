                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T12 fracture  // Aspiration overnight,
 look for acute changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 09:55.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Biapical pleural thickening.  There are linear opacities at
 the bases bilaterally, representing atelectasis.  There is a subcentimeter
 dense nodule, at the left apex, which represents a calcified granuloma.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is status post vertebroplasty
 at multiple thoracic and lumbar levels.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear opacities at the bases bilaterally, which likely represents atelectasis
 due to low lung volumes, however aspiration cannot be excluded.
