                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Per the radiology technologist, the patient was altered and would
 not hold still while the images were being obtained.  There is opacity over
 the right mid-to-lower lung worrisome for pneumonia.  There is also left
 basilar opacity which could be due to additional focus of infection or
 atelectasis.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left upper
 abdomen.  Old posterior right sixth rib fracture is again seen, similar to
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid-to-lower lung consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Patchy left base opacity may be due to additional site of pneumonia and/or
 atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.
