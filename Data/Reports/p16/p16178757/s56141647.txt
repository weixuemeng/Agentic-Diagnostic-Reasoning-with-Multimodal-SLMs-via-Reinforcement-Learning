                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-transfusion shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of a calcified aorta. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Prominence of central pulmonary arteries is again
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 The areas of possible opacification in the left mid zone are not as
 definitively appreciated on the current study, possibly due to changes in the
 degree of obliquity of the patient.
