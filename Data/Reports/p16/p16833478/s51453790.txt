                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L pleural effusion, s/p chest tube eval for
 interval change  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in position compared to the prior
 study.  A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal
 SVC or right atrium.  There is a small amount of subcutaneous air in the left
 chest wall.  No pneumothorax seen.  The the previously demonstrated left
 apical pneumothorax is not clearly seen.  Small right pleural effusion. 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is less well seen than on the prior study. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change.  Unchanged right pleural effusion
 with likely compressive atelectasis.
