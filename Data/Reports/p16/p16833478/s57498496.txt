 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter, terminating in the proximal to mid SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated
 by AP technique. There is minimal left apical pleural thickening/
 calcification. There is minor left basilar atelectasis/ scarring.  There is a
 tubular structure projecting over the lateral left upper abdomen, unclear
 whether this is external or internal to the patient.
