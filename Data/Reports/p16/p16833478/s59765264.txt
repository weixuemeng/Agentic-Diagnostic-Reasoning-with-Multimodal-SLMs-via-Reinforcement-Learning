 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:59 AM
  Right Port-A-Cath remains in the right atrium.  Left pigtail catheter is in
  the left lower lung.  Compared to the study 5 hours prior opacity at the left
  base continues to improve.  Opacity at the right base is also slightly
  improved, possibly reflecting resolving atelectasis and/or effusion.  There is
  no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CT draining now with CP, SOB  // ?
 re-expansion pulm edema      ? re-expansion pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recent ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No appreciable left pleural effusion or pneumothorax, pigtail pleural drain
 still in place along the lateral chest wall.
 
 Persistent left basal consolidation could be atelectasis but is concerning for
 possible pneumonia.  Opacification at both lung bases is probably in part
 dependent edema.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.  Heart size normal.
 
 Right central venous infusion catheter ends in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
