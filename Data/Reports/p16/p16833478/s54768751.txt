 Left internal jugular central line unchanged in position. The heart remains
 enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. There is now
 bilateral hilar fullness and interstitial indistinctness suggestive of mild
 interstitial edema and pulmonary venous hypertension.  Interval development of
 retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or
 pneumonia should be considered in the correct clinical setting.  No
 pneumothorax.  Relatively low lung volumes.
