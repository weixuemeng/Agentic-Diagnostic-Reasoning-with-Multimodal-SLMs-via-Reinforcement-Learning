                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath
 and weight gain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left base
 opacity is seen, which could be due to a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The right
 lung is clear, although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  The aorta is calcified.  Degenerative
 changes are seen at the acromioclavicular, shoulder joints, and along the
 spine.  Small 3-mm calcification projecting over the soft tissue along the
 lateral left humeral head may relate to calcific tendinosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity likely represents combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
