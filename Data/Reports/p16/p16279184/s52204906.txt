                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumonia, increased oxygen
 requirements, evaluate for suspected increased infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within
 normal limits.  Comparison of the portable chest examination demonstrates
 increased number of infiltrates in comparison with the previous study.  The
 new infiltrates are present in the left lower lobe lateral area and scattered
 densities are also observed to have increased in the left upper lobe area. 
 Similar right-sided basal infiltrates occupy now the cardiodiaphragmatic
 triangle on the right base.  The pulmonary vasculature does not show increased
 congestive pattern and lateral pleural sinuses are free, thus excluding
 massive pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased widely spread bilateral pulmonary parenchymal processes
 since next preceding examination one day ago.
