                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness and gait imbalance.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is of normal
 size.  An ill-defined opacity is present in the right upper lobe laterally. 
 Bilateral hila appear slightly enlarged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe ill-defined opacity, likely reflective of
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Hilar prominence is suggestive of
 underlying lymphadenopathy, and further evaluation with chest CT can be
 obtained in this patient with a history of sarcoidosis.
