                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lung cancer and fatigue
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  Minimal atelectasis is
 noted in the lung bases.  Focal rounded opacity within the right upper lobe
 measuring approximately 9 mm corresponds to an area of ground-glass
 opacification on the previous PET-CT and appears unchanged.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Paraseptal emphysema is again noted at the lung apices.  There is no acute
 osseous abnormality.  Degenerative changes are again demonstrated in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Atelectasis in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  Unchanged focal
 rounded opacity in the right upper lobe which corresponds to an area of
 nonspecific ground-glass opacification on the previous PET-CT.
