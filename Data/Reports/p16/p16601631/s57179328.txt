                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  History of idiopathic
 pulmonary fibrosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest.  Coarse interstitial markings seen throughout the
 lungs compatible with patient's known history of fibrosis.  There is a new
 region of consolidation at the right lung base.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities also appears slightly more conspicuous, potentially due atelectasis
 given eventration of left hemidiaphragm which is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is suggestion of a hiatal hernia with
 increased lucency overlying the heart.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings compatible with patient's known IPF with new superimposed region of
 consolidation at the right lung base.  This may be due to component of
 atelectasis or infection in the proper clinical setting.
