                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic lung cancer with left upper lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is still extensive
 opacification anteriorly paralleling the chest wall, consistent with left
 upper lobe collapse.  However, on the frontal view, the degree of collapse
 appears to be slightly less prominent.  A large left hilar mass is again seen.
 
 Right lung is essentially clear.
