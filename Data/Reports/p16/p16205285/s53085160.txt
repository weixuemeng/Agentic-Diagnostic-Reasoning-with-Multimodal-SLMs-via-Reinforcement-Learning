                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 likely due to a small pleural effusion. Right basilar opacity may represent
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains markedly
 enlarged. Aorta calcified and tortuous. There is persistent prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature, possibly due to engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity may be due to combination of small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Persistently
 enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild central vascular engorgement.
