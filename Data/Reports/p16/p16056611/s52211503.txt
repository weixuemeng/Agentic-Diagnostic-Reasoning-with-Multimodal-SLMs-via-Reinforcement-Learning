                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p mechanical fall on left side  // eval for rib
 fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to scout image from chest CT from ___
 and chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal right mid lung linear atelectasis/ scarring is again seen. No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Right paratracheal opacity adjacent to the anterior right first rib likely
 corresponds to vascular structure as seen on CT from ___.
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine. No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No displaced fracture seen. If high clinical
 concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series or chest CT is more sensitive.
