                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with vomiting and elevated WBC, assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  On the lateral
 view, there is area of increased opacity projecting posteriorly in the lower
 lung which may correspond with a subtle opacity in the right medial
 cardiophrenic recess on the frontal projection.  While this finding was not
 definitely identified on the prior exam and therefore may represent a focal
 consolidation, though the possibility of a nodule is not excluded.  Aside from
 this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  The heart size
 is stable and top normal in size.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged with an
 unfolded thoracic aorta.  The bony structures are intact.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes with anterior osteophytes in the thoracic spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the posterior right medial lung base which was not
 clearly seen on prior exam and is somewhat atypical in appearance for
 pneumonia.  Consider repeat chest radiograph post-treatment to ensure
 resolution or CT may be performed to further assess.
