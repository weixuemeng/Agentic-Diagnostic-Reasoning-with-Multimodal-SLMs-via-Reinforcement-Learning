                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer, now with new
 right pulmonary lesion, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a persistent
 ill-defined opacity in the right medial cardiophrenic recess which projects
 over the left atrium on the corresponding lateral radiograph.  This opacity is
 not appreciably changed from ___.  The lungs are otherwise clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within normal limits.  The
 thoracic aorta is unfolded with mild tortuosity of the descending thoracic
 aorta.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted with bridging
 osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent ill-defined opacity at the right medial lung base.  A
 followup CT is recommended for further evaluation, particularly in the setting
 of prior malignancy, to exclude metastasis.
