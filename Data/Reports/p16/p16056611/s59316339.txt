                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  VATS right lower lobe wedge resection, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 substantially increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  As a
 consequence, areas of atelectasis that pre-existed at the right and left lung
 bases have partially or completely resolved.  Soft tissue defect in the left
 chest wall.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  The hilar and mediastinal structures are normal.  No evidence
 of acute lung disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  The lateral
 radiograph shows extensive degenerative vertebral disease.
