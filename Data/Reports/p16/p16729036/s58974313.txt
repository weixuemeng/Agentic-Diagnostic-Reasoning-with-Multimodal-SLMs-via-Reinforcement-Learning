                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dry cough for several days, elevated white blood cell
 count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight increase in opacity projecting over the lung bases, on the frontal
 view, not well substantiated on the lateral view, and may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infectious process is not entirely excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
