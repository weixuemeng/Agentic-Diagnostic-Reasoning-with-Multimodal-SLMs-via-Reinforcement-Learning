                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall, injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is minimal left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The bones are diffusely
 osteopenic, making evaluation for subtle fractures suboptimal, although no
 definite acute fractures seen.  Mild anterior wedging of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is grossly stable.  Right upper quadrant surgical clips are
 again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Diffuse osteopenia.
