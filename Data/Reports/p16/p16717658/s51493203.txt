                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively normal pulmonary
 vessels, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pericardial effusion. 
 Opacification at the left base is consistent with some combination of volume
 loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  The monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.
