                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pericardial tamponade now with hypoxia.  Please evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is continued opacification of the left lung base with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, again consistent with pleural effusion
 and consolidation.  Increased haziness at the right lung base may also
 indicate a small pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiac
 silhouette appears smaller than on the most recent prior study.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  There has been interval placement of a tube
 overlying the lower left hemithorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Continued moderate left pleural effusion with left lower lobe
 collapse. Increased small right pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema.
