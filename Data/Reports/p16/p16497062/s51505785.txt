                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p CABG, new bigeminy // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central line has been removed. The lungs are well expanded and
 clear. There has been resolution of the previously seen left base atelectasis.
 There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, which may reflect
 pleural thickening versus small bilateral pleural effusions. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are seen, consistent with a history of CABG.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Blunting of the costophrenic angles may
 reflect pleural thickening versus small bilateral pleural effusions.
