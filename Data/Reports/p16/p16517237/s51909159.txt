                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after stroke with shortness
 of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial.  The replaced mitral valve is noted.  There is
 mild vascular congestion and minimal interstitial opacities, but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is demonstrated, large.  Minimal
 amount of left pleural fluid is noted but potentially underestimated on this
 portable radiograph.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The ET tube tip is
 6.3 cm above the carina.
