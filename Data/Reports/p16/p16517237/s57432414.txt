                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of stroke.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4.3 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach.  A left
 subclavian central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid SVC. 
 These are all unchanged from the prior exam.  Again, in the right upper lung
 zone, there is ill-defined rounded 12 mm opacity.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Sternal wires are intact.  A prosthetic valve is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
 2.  Rounded opacity in the right upper lung zone.  Recommend a non-emergent
 chest CT for further characterization.
 
 Results were discussed with the neurology resident caring for the patient by
