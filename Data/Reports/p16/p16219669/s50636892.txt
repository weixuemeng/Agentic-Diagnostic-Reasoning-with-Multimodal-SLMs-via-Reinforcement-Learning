                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall from standing, confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle could
 suggests a trace left pleural effusion.  Atelectasis is seen in the lung bases
 without focal consolidation.  No large pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.  Multiple ovoid and
 rounded ossific densities within the right shoulder likely reflect loose
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
