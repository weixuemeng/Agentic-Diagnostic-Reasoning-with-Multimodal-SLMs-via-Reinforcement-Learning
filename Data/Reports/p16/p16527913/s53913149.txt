                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Loculated hydropneumothoraces are present in the left hemithorax
 anteromedially, and are overall probably not appreciably changed compared to
 the prior study allowing for positional differences.  The patient is status
 post left upper lobe resection with expected post-operative volume loss. 
 Post-operative small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study, and
 a very small right pleural effusion is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent loculated left hydropneumothoraces status post left
 upper lobe resection.
