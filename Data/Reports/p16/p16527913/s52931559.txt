                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and CT abdomen of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval worsening of consolidation in the right middle and right
 lower lobes, as well as development of new consolidation in the left lower
 lobe.  Previously reported focal opacity in the left upper lobe has slightly
 improved, however.  The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Small pleural effusions are new.  Increased lung volumes with increased AP
 diameter suggest the possibility of underlying emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multifocal consolidation consistent with a multifocal
 pneumonia, possibly due to clinically suspected aspiration.  Followup chest
 x-rays in four to six weeks after appropriate antibiotic therapy are
 recommended to ensure complete resolution, particularly of the more focal
 opacity in the left upper lobe, in order to exclude the possibility of a
 pulmonary neoplasm.
