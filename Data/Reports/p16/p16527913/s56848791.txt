                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nonproductive cough and vomiting and worsening abdominal pain.  Rule
 out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is
 opacification involving the right middle and left upper lobes concerning for
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  Coronary calcifications are noted, otherwise,
 the mediastinum is normal.  The imaged upper abdomen is remarkable for dilated
 loops of bowel which are better evaluated on the dedicated abdominal
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right middle and left upper lobe opacities worrisome for pneumonia
 and/or aspiration.  Followup chest radiographs are recommended to ensure
 clearance.
