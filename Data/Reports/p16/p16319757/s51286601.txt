                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Opacity
 projecting over the lung bases is likely enlarged part due to overlying soft
 tissue and makes evaluation of the lung bases suboptimal.  On the lateral
 view, no large pleural effusion, or evidence of focal consolidation is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Suboptimal evaluation of the lung bases due to overlying soft tissue, however,
 on the lateral view, no large pleural effusion or focal consolidation seen.
