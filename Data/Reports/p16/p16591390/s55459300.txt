                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.  Known pulmonary metastases.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There are widespread nodules of medium size throughout each
 lung, but more extensive and lower than upper lungs, most suggestive of
 metastatic disease.  Although this appearance may obscure subtle evidence for
 pneumonia, there is no definite secondary process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread metastatic disease.  No definite evidence of acute
 superimposed process.
