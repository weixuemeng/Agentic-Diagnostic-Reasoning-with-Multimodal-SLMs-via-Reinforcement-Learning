                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient and an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post CABG with sternotomy wires seen well aligned. 
 There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  Significant bilateral interstitial
 pulmonary edema is seen with associated septal lines.  There are bilateral
 pleural effusions, moderate of the right and mild on the left.  There is a
 poorly defined opacity seen within the right middle and right lower lobes, and
 while this may be secondary to asymmetric edema, the localized distribution of
 the opacification suggests a potential pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax
 identified.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No bony
 abnormality is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly and widespread interstitial edema. More confluent opacity in
 right mid and lower lungs may reflect asymmetrical edema, but infection should
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Follow up radiographs after
 diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
