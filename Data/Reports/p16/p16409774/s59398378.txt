                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with end-stage renal disease status post pneumonia
 and empyema.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest x-rays were obtained.  Our records do not include a
 previous exam for comparison.  Note is made of sternotomy wires and surgical
 ___ related to prior CABG.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and there
 is moderate widening of the thoracic aorta.  There is prominent pleural
 scarring on the right side and blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus
 presumably related to prior empyema; however, there is no evidence of free
 fluid.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided pleural scarring and blunting of right costophrenic sulcus, but no
 pleural effusion.
