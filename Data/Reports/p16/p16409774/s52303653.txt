                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously visualized right basilar opacity has increased and is most likely
 representative of an infectious process.  Left basal atelectatic changes are
 again noted.  Otherwise, bilateral interstitial markings are again noted,
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contours appear stable when the patient is post CABG.  No acute fractures are
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progression of previously visualized right lower lung opacity consistent with
 right lower lobe pneumonia. Additionally, there is increased left basilar
 opacity which represent atelectasis or be a part of a multifocal infectious
 process. Mild pulmonary edema persists.
