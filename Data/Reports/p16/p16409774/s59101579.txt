                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours is accompanied by
 worsening diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema.  A more confluent area of
 opacity in the right lower lobe may reflect superimposed pneumonia.  Moderate
 right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged.
