                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with numerous right lateral rib fractures and
 diffuse crepitus, found to have a right apical pneumothorax and subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Evaluate for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval development of a
 large left pneumothorax.  Slight rightward shift of the mediastinum suggests
 tension.  The right apical pneumothorax is no longer seen. Subcutaneous and
 mediastinal emphysema is unchanged, as are multiple lateral right rib
 fractures.  Right base atelectasis is slightly increased.  The heart size
 remains normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New large left pneumothorax with rightward shift of the mediastinum
 suggestive of tension.  
 
 2.  Slight increase in right base atelectasis.  
 
 3.  Resolution of a small right apical pneumothorax and unchanged subcutaneous
 and mediastinal emphysema.  
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by ___, MD, to
 ___, NP, at ___ on ___, immediately upon discovery.
