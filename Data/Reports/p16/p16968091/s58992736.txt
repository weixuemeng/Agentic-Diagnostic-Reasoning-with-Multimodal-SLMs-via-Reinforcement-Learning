                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, with subcutaneous and
 mediastinal emphysema after fall and fracture of multiple lateral right ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 every ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates subcutaneous and
 mediastinal emphysema, which is unchanged to minimally decreased compared to
 prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low and right base
 atelectasis may be slightly increased.  Right lateral rib fractures are
 identified but better assessed on recent CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Largely unchanged subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema.  
 
 2. No pneumothorax. 
 
 3. Possibly slightly increased right base atelectasis.
