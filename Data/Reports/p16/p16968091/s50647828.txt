 callus formation, like the right ninth posterior rib.  A small amount of right

 anteriorly and laterally.  No left pleural effusion is present but there is
 mild left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.

 1.  Multiple healing right-sided rib fractures and small likely loculated
 right pleural effusion.
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
