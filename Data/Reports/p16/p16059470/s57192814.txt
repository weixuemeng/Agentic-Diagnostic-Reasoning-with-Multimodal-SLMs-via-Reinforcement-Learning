 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___, ___.  CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:   Limited evaluation due to respiratory motion especially in the
 lower lungs.  The previously seen right basilar patchy opacity appears
 improved. A granuloma is seen in the right upper lobe. The interstitial
 markings are slightly prominent due to patient's known emphysematous changes
 of the lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  An ICD
 device is seen. RUE PICC line ends in the distal SVC.  There are no displaced
 rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited, negative. PICC in appropriate position. Limited
 evaluation due to motion artifact, repeat CXR might be considered.
