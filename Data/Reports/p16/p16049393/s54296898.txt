                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory distress and severe COPD. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
 retrocardiac patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.  There is mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, most significant at the bases, which is slightly improved. 
 There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis.
 2.  Persistent although somewhat improved mild interstitial pulmonary edema,
 worst at the bases.
