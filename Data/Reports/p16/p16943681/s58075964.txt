 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly has
 increased compared to the previous examination.  The aortic knob is densely
 calcified.  Moderate pulmonary edema is worse in the interval. More focal
 opacification in the right lung base could reflect an area of infection. 
 Small right pleural effusion appears new.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Punctate calcifications in the right apex appear unchanged.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.

 1. Moderate congestive heart failure with small right pleural effusion and

 2. More focal opacification in the right lung base could reflect an area of
 infection.
