  Compared to the earlier study, the lungs seem slightly better aerated,
  although with persistent perihilar opacities, likely due to developing
  multifocal pneumonia as described earlier.  Pulmonary edema is mild.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute SOB desat to ___%  // r/o aspiration 
 r/o aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has improved since earlier in
 the day, largely due to better lung volumes.  Whether this is widespread
 pneumonia or asymmetric edema is radiographically indeterminate, although I
 expect both are present.
 
 There is also been consistent fullness to the lower pole of the right hilus,
 possibly due to adenopathy.  Heart size is top-normal.  Mitral annulus
 calcification is very heavy, which can contribute to acute mitral
 regurgitation.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large.  No
 pneumothorax.
