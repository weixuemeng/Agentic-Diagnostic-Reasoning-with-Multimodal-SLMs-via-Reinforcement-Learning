                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied
 by pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral interstitial opacities.  The
 interstitial opacities appear more symmetrical than on earlier today study,
 favoring asymmetrical edema over atypical pneumonia.  Continued radiographic
 followup would be helpful to ensure resolution in order to exclude either
 atypical pneumonia or a more chronic interstitial abnormality.
