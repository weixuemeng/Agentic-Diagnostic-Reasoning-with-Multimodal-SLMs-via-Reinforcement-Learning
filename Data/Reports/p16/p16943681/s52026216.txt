                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/recent PNA, back with cough  // ___F w/recent PNA, back with
 cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  The study is read in comparison with prior chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The overall appearance of the chest is similar compared to the prior study,
 with perhaps mild interval increase in interstitial prominence.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists, and moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is re- demonstrated, and not significantly changed. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Overall similar appearance of the chest compared to the prior study with
 mildly increased interstitial edema.
 2. Persistent retrocardiac opacity, compatible with recently diagnosed
 community-acquired pneumonia.  Repeat after treatment suggested to document
 resolution.
