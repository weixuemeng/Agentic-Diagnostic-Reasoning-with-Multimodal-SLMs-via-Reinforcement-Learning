                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, worsening shortness of breath overnight.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ in
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low, similar to prior exam.  Increased interstitial
 markings are seen throughout the lungs, left greater than right, which may
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial pulmonary markings, left greater than right, which may
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  If this does not resolve with treatment
 for pulmonary edema, this appearance could also reflect an atypical pneumonia
 or less likely lypmhangitic carcinomatosis.
