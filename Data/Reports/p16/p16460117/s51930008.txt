                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent shortness of breath, ? etiology
 // ___ year old woman with persistent shortness of breath, ? etiology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ in ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are fully expanded.  Interval improvement of moderate
 pulmonary edema.  However there are residual interstitial opacities which
 likely represent chronic interstitial changes from multiple prior CHF
 exacerbations.  The cardio mediastinal silhouette is not enlarged and there is
 no associated vascular engorgement or pulmonary effusions.  The proximal
 trachea is slightly more deviated to the left which may indicate the presence
 of a right goiter.  Interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Scoliosis of thoracic spine is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  A possible right thyroid goiter.  Please correlate clinically.
