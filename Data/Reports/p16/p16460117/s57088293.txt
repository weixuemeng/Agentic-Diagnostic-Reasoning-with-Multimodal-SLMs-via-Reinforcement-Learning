                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new onset atrial fibrillation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base with peribronchial
 cuffing could reflect atelectasis, though infection is not completely
 excluded. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized. There are multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine. S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is also
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal left basilar patchy opacity. This could reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.
