                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension and nausea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contour is similar.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly
 suggests trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities in lung bases
 may reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures of multilevel severe degenerative
 changes.  Compression deformity of a low thoracic vertebral body, similar to
 the previous examinations.  Extensive degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint is again noted.  There appears to be chronic inferior
 subluxation of the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with trace bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but early infection or
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
