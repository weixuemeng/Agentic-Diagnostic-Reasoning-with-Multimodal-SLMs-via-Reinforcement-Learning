 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.  The previously noted right upper
 extremity PICC line has been removed.  There is a left-sided pleural effusion
 which is at least moderate in size with associated left basal compressive
 atelectasis.  Aside from right basal atelectasis, the right lung appears
 clear.  The heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is prominent
 though unchanged.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with associated compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Low lung volumes limits assessment.
