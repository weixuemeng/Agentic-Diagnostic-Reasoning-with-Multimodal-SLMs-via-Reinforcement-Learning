                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Apparent rightward mediastinal widening is likely due to
 accentuation of tortuous vessels by patient rotation and low lung volumes,
 particularly given absence of a mediastinal abnormality in this region on
 recent chest CT of ___.  However, repeat radiograph with
 improved lung volumes and positioning would be helpful to confirm this
 impression.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size.  The lungs are clear
 except for minor atelectasis at the lung bases and a questionable small right
 pleural effusion.  No visible pneumothorax.
