                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever status post chemotherapy, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two AP projections through the chest were obtained.  A large left
 pleural effusion has substantially increased in size since ___.  There
 is minimal vascular redistribution and mild cardiomegally.  The right lung is
 clear without effusion, consolidation or pneumothorax.  An oval opacity
 projects over the ___ left anterior interspace.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left effusion.  The additional presence of a pneumonia or
 renal metastasis cannot be delineated.  Repeat radiographs after diuresis will
 be helpful.  CT may eventually be required to better characterize the left
 lower lobe process and left upper lobe opacity.
