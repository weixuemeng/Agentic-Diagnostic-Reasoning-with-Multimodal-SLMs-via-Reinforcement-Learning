                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:18 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Small pneumothorax after thoracentesis, evaluate for worsening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs, ___:
 
 Even though some chest radiographs yesterday suggest a small left apical
 pneumothorax, none is seen currently.  Heterogeneous consolidation in the left
 lung raises concern for pneumonia, but I would not be surprised if there are
 several nodules of substantial size in the lower portion of the lung
 particularly.  Heart size is top normal.  Small left pleural effusion
 persists.
