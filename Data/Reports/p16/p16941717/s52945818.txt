 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate mild cardiomegaly, similar
 as compared to ___.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The heart is again enlarged.  There is a mild diffuse interstitial
 process without focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural

 cardiomegaly, the possibility of pulmonary congestion could alternatively be
 considered in the appropriate setting.
