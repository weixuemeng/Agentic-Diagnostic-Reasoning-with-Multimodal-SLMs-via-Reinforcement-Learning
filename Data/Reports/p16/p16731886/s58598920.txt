                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  An area of
 scarring at the right lung base is better assessed on the prior CT from
 ___.  There is also mild scarring in the inferior lingula which likely
 accounts for the subtle opacity abutting the left heart border.  There is no
 new consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pneumothorax seen.  There is
 mild blunting of the right CP angle which could indicate a tiny pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Bony structures are intact.  Multiple surgical clips are noted in the right
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Foci of of scarring in the lower lungs.  Possible tiny right
 pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
