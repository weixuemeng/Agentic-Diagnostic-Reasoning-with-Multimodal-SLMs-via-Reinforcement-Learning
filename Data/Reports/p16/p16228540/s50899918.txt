                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and hypoxemia, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph, ___:
 
 The lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Local thickening of the left lower
 costal pleural margin at the level of the anterolateral left sixth rib is more
 pronounced today than it was in ___.  This could be either deposition of
 subcostal fat or a small lipoma, but is unlikely to be of clinical
 significance in the absence of referable signs and symptoms, such as local
 tenderness or pain with breathing.
