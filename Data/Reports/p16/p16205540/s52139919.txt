                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever of unknown source.  // Rule out
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC line is present, tip near SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 A Dobbhoff type tube is present.  Radiopaque tip appears to to have advanced
 and now lies beyond the field-of-view of these images.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis similar to the prior
 study.  There is increased retrocardiac density and blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study, compatible with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possible small left effusion.
 
 No CHF.  No right-sided infiltrate or effusion.  Platelike atelectasis the
 cardiophrenic region is similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac density with probable small left effusion could reflect
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, but is not significantly
 changed compared with ___.  No new infiltrate identified.  Right
 cardiophrenic angle atelectasis is similar to the prior study.  Inspiratory
 volumes remain low.
