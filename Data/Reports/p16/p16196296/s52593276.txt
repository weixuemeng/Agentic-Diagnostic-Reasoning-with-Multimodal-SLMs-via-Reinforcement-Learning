                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is subtle hazy opacification within the left lung base, which may reflect an
 area of atelectasis or developing infection.  No definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There are no acute
 osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity within the left lung base, which could reflect an
 area of atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
