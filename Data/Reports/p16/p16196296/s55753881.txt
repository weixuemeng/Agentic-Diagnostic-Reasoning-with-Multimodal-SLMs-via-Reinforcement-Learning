 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, asthma, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lateral radiograph now
 confirms the presence of a right lower lobe opacity, strongly suggestive of
 pneumonia.  Enlargement of the right hilus, indicative of hilar
 lymphadenopathy, persists.  There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly but no
 evidence of pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
