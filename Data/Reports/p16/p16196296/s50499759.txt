                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  CTA chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Hazy opacification at the left lung base is slightly improved from
 ___.  A small left pleural effusion has resolved.  A small opacity
 at the right base is unchanged from the prior radiograph.  These hazy
 opacities likely reflect infection with superimposed scarring.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Unchanged right basilar opacification may reflect infection with associated
 scarring.
 2. Improved left basilar opacification and resolved left pleural effusion.
