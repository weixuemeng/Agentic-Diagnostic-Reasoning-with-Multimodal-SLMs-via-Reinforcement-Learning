                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is new since the prior study,
 suggesting small right pleural effusion with overlying right base atelectasis.
 Additional basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis although consolidation
 due to infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion, new since prior study.  Basilar opacity may be
 due to atelectasis, however, underlying infection/pneumonia is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
