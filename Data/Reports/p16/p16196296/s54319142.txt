                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and COPD with worsening dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is increased opacification of the right lung base suggestive of an early
 developing infectious process.  Minimal opacity is also noted in the left lung
 base and likely atelectasis.  Right pleural effusion has resolved with a small
 left pleural effusion may now be present.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
 No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increase newly increased opacities at the right lung base suggestive of an
 early developing right lower lobe pneumonia. Minimal opacity is also noted in
 the left lung base and likely atelectasis.  Aspiration should be excluded as a
 cause in the proper clinical setting.
