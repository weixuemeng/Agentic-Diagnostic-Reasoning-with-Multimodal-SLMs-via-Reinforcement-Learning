 FINDINGS:  Opacity at the right lower lobe maybe focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or atelectasis. The right hilus is prominent which may be due to
 adenopathy as seen on the prior CT and a combination of pulmonary artery
 hypertension.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Osseous structures are intact.

 chest radiograph is recommended.
