                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever, on chemo.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen
 terminating in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction.  There is mild left basilar
 atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  There is possible minimal
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which may be due to trace
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
