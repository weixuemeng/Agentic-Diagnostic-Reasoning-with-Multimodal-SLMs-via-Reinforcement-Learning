                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath device terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Lung volumes are
 low with a patchy left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen. Right
 lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus could indicate a trace left pleural effusion. Multiple
 clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen. Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures is compatible
 with known widespread sclerotic metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes, but infection cannot be completely excluded. Minimal blunting of
 the left costophrenic sulcus could suggest a trace left pleural effusion. 
 Diffuse skeletal metastases.
