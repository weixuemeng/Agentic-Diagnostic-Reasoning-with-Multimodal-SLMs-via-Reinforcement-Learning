                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, on chemotherapy, history of metastatic breast
 cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate a left chest
 wall Port-A-Cath with tip in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are low with linear
 opacity in the left lung base, most likely atelectasis.  A tiny left pleural
 effusion would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal and stable.  No pneumothorax or convincing signs of pulmonary edema. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal atelectasis with possible tiny left pleural effusion. 
 Otherwise unremarkable, though lung volumes are low.
