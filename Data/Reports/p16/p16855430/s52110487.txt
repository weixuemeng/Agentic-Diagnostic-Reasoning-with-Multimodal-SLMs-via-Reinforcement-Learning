 tract infection.

 atelectasis.  The opacities on the right persist, and the vascular diameters
 have decreased but have still not returned to normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.

 improvement but not complete resolution of the pre-existing pulmonary edema,
