                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal lateral views chest performed. A left upper extremity PICC
 has been removed.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains chronically and moderately enlarged.  There are
 small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions which have increased in size
 from prior.  Additionally, enlargement of the azygous vein with indistinctness
 of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with congestive failure.  More
 focal appearing consolidations are seen in the middle lobe and a lower lobe,
 probably left.  There is no pneumothorax.  The imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2. Opacities within one of the lower lobes, probably the left, and in the
 middle lobe could represent more focal consolidations.  Either repeating the
 study after diuresis or obtaining oblique views would be helpful in
 clarification.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 08:37 AM on
 ___.
