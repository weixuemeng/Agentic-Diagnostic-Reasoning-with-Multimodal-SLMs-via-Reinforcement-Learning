                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Left PICC is in stable position, tip in
 the mid SVC.  There has been interval progression of the bilateral parenchymal
 opacities more so on the left which appears more confluent in the perihilar
 region most compatible with pulmonary edema.  More dense retrocardiac opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm suspicious for superimposed effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progression of pulmonary edema and persistent left effusion.  Superimposed
 infection would be difficult to exclude.
