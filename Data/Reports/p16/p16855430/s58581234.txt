 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CHF, DVT/PE and gout.  Question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Previously identified left PICC line is no longer seen. 
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There are indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings suggestive of fluid overload.  There are also possible small
 bilateral pleural effusions noting that lateral view is limited secondary to
 patient's arms obscuring visualization.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable.  Degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joints
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Finding suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion with possible
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
