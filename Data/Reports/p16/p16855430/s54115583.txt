                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema, similar compared to the prior
 exam, with a small to moderate left pleural effusion, also relatively
 unchanged.  Probable small right pleural effusion is likely present.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Left basilar opacification likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and unchanged small to moderate left and small right
 pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects compressive
 atelectasis.
