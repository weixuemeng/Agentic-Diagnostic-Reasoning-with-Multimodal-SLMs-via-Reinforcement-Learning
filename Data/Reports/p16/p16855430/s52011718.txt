                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC displaced after dressing change, here to evaluate PICC
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC has been re-positioned with the tip now terminating in
 the left brachiocephalic vein.  Replacement is recommended.  There are
 persistent low lung volumes and increased opacification of the right lung base
 reflecting increased small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening
 atelectasis.  Left basilar atelectasis is also increased.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged without overt
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged but
 stable.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic knob
 is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retraction of the left PICC with tip terminating in the left
 brachiocephalic vein in comparison to ___.  Replacement is recommended.
 2.  Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis with
 decreased lung volumes from ___.
 3.  Unchanged mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 12:10 p.m.
