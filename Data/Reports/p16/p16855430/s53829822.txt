                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chills and sweats.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild to moderately enlarged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Although not nearly as striking is the prior study,
 the pulmonary vascularity is indistinct, and the appearance suggests mild
 vascular congestion, without definite focal opacity.  Hemidiaphragms are
 flattened.  Fissures are minimally thickened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
