                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, now with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is increased opacity at the left lung base, with associated volume loss.
 This could represent worsening of effusion and atelectasis, though developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Additional increasec opacity in the right
 suprahilar region may reflect additional focus of airspace disease. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs remain well aerated.  A small amount of right pleural
 fluid is present.  Heart size is persistenly enalrged.  There is pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without frank edema, which is little changed from prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left basilar and right upper lung opacity could reflect
 developing pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
