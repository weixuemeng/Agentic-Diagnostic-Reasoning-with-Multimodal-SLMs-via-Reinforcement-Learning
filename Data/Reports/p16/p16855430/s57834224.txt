 There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC,
 appropriately sited.  Heart size is enlarged but stable.  There is a
 persistent left retrocardiac opacity and likely left-sided pleural effusion. 
 There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of
 minimal fluid overload, slightly worse than on the prior study.  No
 pneumothoraces are seen.
