                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, afebrile, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 improved aeration of the bilateral upper lungs; however, there is persistent
 if not slightly improved bibasilar opacifications, possibly due to atelectasis
 and bilateral pleural effusions, though superimposed infectious process is not
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of upper lungs with stable if not slightly
 improved bibasilar opacifications, likely a combination of atelectasis and
 effusions, though pneumonia is not excluded.
