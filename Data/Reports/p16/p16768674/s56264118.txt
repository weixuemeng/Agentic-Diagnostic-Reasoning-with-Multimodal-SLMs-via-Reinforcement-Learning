                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with trauma  // trauma pan scan      trauma pan scan
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Supine positioning and low level inspiration exaggerating mild enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Upper mediastinal contours are normal.  Vascular
 crowding makes it impossible to exclude interstitial pulmonary edema, but the
 lungs are probably clear.  No pleural abnormality.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
