                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Suspected aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates a
 moderate left pleural effusion with interval increase in the opacification of
 the left lower lobe.  The left upper lobe and the right lung are clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion.  The heart is top normal
 in size, stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate left pleural effusion with interval increase in
 left lower lobe opacity.  This may represent worsening compressive
 atelectasis; however, consolidation due to an infectious process cannot be
 ruled out.
