                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and abnormal laboratory values.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is
 unchanged, likely top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Moderate-sized left pleural effusion appears unchanged.  There is associated
 left basilar opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. A trace right
 pleural effusion appears resolved. The right lung is clear.  No pulmonary
 vascular engorgement or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change in left moderate-sized pleural effusion and left
 basilar compressive atelectasis.
