                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CKD and CHF. Crackles on exam. Complaining of cough.  //
 Pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Right IJ access dialysis
 catheter extends to the left of midline likely via left-sided SVC a with tip
 projecting over the region of the right atrium.  In addition, a left chest
 wall AICD noted with lead following the course of the dialysis catheter to the
 left of midline likely via a left-sided SVC with the tip in the expected
 region of the right atrium.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
 are noted.  There is subtle consolidation in the right middle lobe which is
 concerning for pneumonia.  Background emphysema is noted.  A tiny right
 pleural effusion is present.  Left lung is clear.  No signs of edema.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  No acute bony
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right middle lobe pneumonia, small right pleural effusion, emphysema.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
 3. Dialysis catheter and AICD lead course into the right atrium by way of what
 appears to be a left-sided SVC.  Please correlate clinically.
