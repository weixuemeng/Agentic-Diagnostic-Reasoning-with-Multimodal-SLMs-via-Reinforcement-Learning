                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new stroke  // Shortness of breath
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly again noted.  Compared to ___, there is a new
 small left pleural effusion, with underlying atelectasis.  The previously seen
 small right effusion may be slightly larger.  Small lucent locule at the right
 cardiophrenic angle is of uncertain etiology, but is unlikely to represent a
 pneumothorax unless there has been recent intervention.  Previously seen
 vascular plethora has resolved.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of vascular plethora.  No evidence of CHF. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged but unchanged.
 
 New small left effusion with underlying atelectasis.  No definite infectious
 infiltrate.  Small right pleural effusion is slightly larger.
 
 New lucent locule in the right cardiophrenic region, of uncertain etiology or
 significance --___ to this area on followup films is requested.  A
 loculated pneumothorax or bleb might account for this appearance, but unless
 there has been recent intervention, pneumothorax is considered unlikely. 
 Alternatively, this could represent artifact due to localized scarring.
