 Postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has not changed
 since ___.  If there is a pericardial effusion it is not hemodynamically
 sufficient to distend mediastinal veins.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged,
 although improved and there is no appreciable pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are small but unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
