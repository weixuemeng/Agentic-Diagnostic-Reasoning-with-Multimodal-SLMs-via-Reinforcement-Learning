                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, the right
 apical pneumothorax has improved. The distance between the right apical pleura
 and second rib is 1.8 cm.  Mediastinal structures are midline.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions remain unchanged. 
 Opacities at lung bases are most readily explained by atelectasis.  However,
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improving small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities most readily explained by atelectasis; however, early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded, and close monitoring is recommended.
