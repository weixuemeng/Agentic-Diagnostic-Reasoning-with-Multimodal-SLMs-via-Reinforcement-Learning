                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR, reintubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 7:44.
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is low, directed towards the right mainstem
 bronchus.  The Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach.  There has been interval
 placement of a chest tube with the tip projecting over the left lung base with
 a new moderate-sized left pneumothorax.  The right chest tube is unchanged in
 position with the tip still in the chest wall.  The right pneumothorax has
 resolved.  The right PICC and left internal jugular catheters are unchanged in
 position, ending in the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Otherwise, there is little change in mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Moderate left pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
 
 2. Interval resolution of right pneumothorax.
 
 3. Endotracheal tube is low, directed towards the right mainstem bronchus and
 should be pulled back to avoid bronchial intubation.
