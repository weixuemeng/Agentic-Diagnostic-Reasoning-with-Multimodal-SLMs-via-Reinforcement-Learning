                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post CABG/AVR and status post
 right thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 7:35.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As oppose to earlier film, there is a right apical hyperlucent
 zone. Despite the fact that no pleural line is seen, a pneumothorax must be
 suspected. Right pleural effusion has decreased. There is increased
 opacification of the left lower lung likely related to a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Right PICC line terminates in the upper
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right apical hyperlucent zone with no definite pleural line,
 concerning for a new pneumothorax. Recommend followup upright chest
 radiographs within ___ hours.
