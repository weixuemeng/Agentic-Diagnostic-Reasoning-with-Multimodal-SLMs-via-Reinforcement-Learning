                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough, and weight gain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a mild predominantly central
 interstitial abnormality with peribronchial cuffing that is not striking but
 appears increased from baseline examination.  This is not entirely specific
 but would be compatible with airway inflammation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature centered along the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected mild interstitial abnormality, which could probably be
 explained by airway inflammation, although other etiologies such as mild
 pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia are possible.
