                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed at ___ earlier the same day at 4:04
 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There are multiple skin-folds
 projecting over the right hemithorax in a different configuration compared to
 prior.  Of note, lung markings are not seen at the periphery on the right nor
 on the left, which is likely due to technique and patient as opposed to
 confirmatory evidence of a pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected right-sided skin-fold mimicking a pneumothorax;
 however, confirmation with PA and lateral performed in the radiology
 department to eliminate this finding is suggested to confirm.  Findings were
 discussed with ___ resident at 9:20 p.m. on ___.
