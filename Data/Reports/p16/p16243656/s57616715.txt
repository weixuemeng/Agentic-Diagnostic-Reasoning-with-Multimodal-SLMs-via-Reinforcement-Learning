                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or loculated areas of hydropneumothorax.  Opacification at the
 right base is again seen, consistent with combination of pleural fluid and
 volume loss in the lower lung.  The left lung is essentially clear.
