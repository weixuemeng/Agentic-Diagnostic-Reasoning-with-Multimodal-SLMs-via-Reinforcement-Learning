                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures or pneumothorax.  Assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The right-sided moderate
 pleural effusion has increased with progressive obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm, suggesting a subpulmonic component.  Accompanying atelectasis
 is also increased.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated
 with out evidence of pneumothorax.  Trace left pleural effusion may also be
 present.  Otherwise the left lung is well aerated.  The heart and mediastinum
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increase in moderate right-sided pleural effusion, possibly with a
 subpulmonic component.
