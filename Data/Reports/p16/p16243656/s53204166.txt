                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures and hemopneumothorax, evaluate for
 progression.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and a CT
 chest dated ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated are multiple right-sided rib fractures, some of which are
 segmental and consistent with a flail chest.  There is a stable right-sided
 apical pneumothorax, as well as multiple stable appearing hydropneumothoraces
 within the right lower to mid hemi thorax.  There are several right-sided
 perihilar / basilar opacities noted, improving and more fully characterized as
 atelectasis on the recent chest CT.  A small, left-sided pleural effusion is
 noted, similar in size as compared to the prior examination.  The heart size
 is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Multiple contiguous right-sided rib fractures, suggestive of flail chest. 
 
 
 2.  Stable appearance of a right-sided apical pneumothorax, and multiple
 loculated, right-sided hydropneumothoraces.  
 
 3.  Improving right perihilar/ basilar atelectasis.  
 
 4.  Stable, small left-sided pleural effusion.
