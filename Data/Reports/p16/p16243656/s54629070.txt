                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion and hemothorax, improved on last radiograph. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there continues to be a moderate right pleural
 effusion/hemothorax with considerable atelectasis of the right lung. 
 Additionally, at the right base, there is increasing consolidation which may
 be a functioning of worsening atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia.  The left
 lung is well aerated with no pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again noted.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of right basilar consolidation which may be a
 function of atelectasis or concurrent pneumonia.  Continued moderate right
 pleural effusion/hemothorax.
