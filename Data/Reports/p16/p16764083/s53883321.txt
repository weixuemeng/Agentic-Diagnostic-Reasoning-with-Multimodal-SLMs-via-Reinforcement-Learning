                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ player, struck board with right chest.
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax. The mid-sternum (upper body) is bowed posteriorly, but there is
 no cortical break. The presternal soft tissue may be swollen.  There is no
 retrosternal pleural or anterior mediastinal abnormality. The region can be
 readily evaluated by palpation to see if this is a normal anatomic variant or
 the result of trauma. No displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Sternal abnormality could be normal anatomic variant or result of
 trauma, recent or remote.  Clinical examination can differentiate. Please note
 that radiography is not sensitive for chest wall trauma.
