                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAD, HTN, CKD, DM2, now with pleuritic
 chest pain  // consolidation, congestion, PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat improved compared to the prior study.  The trachea
 is central.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  Heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  Prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary
 vascular structures is less apparent than on the prior study.  No frank
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion seen.  Degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in lung volumes likely resulting in less convincing
 evidence of congestive heart failure.  No frank pulmonary edema seen.
