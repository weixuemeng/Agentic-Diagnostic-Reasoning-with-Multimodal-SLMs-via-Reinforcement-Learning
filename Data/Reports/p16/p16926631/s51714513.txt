                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DM2, CKD, HTN, HLD, presented with
 dysarthria and L facial droop  // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low resulting crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular
 structures.  This likely contributes to the appearance of congestive heart
 failure with borderline, cardiomegaly, prominent hila and prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of mild congestive heart failure likely related to the low
 lung volumes.  No focal consolidation seen.
