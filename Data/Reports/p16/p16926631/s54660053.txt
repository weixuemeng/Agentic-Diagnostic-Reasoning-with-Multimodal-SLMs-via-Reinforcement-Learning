 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is
 top normal.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
