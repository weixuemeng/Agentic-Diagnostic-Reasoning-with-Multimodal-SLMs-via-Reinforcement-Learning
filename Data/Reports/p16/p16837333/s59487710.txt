  1. Endotracheal tube terminates within the right mainstem bronchus.
  Repositioning recommended.
  
  2. Prominence of the right hilum could reflect underlying lymphadenopathy
  versus underlying lesion. Comparison with prior chest examination is
  recommended if available. If unavailable, further evaluation with chest CT
  recommended if clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post transfer. Evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates in the in the right mainstem bronchus. An
 orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, tip is not included on this
 examination, but the side hole is well within the stomach. Patient is slightly
 rotated. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Mild focal rounded prominence of the right mid hilum may reflect an enlarged
 vessel or lymph node. There is calcification of the aortic knob.  Linear
 opacities are seen within the right lung base, suggestive of atelectasis.
 Additionally, multiple surgical clips are seen overlying the right lung base.
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small
 pleural effusion. There is prominence of the right hilum. No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates within the right mainstem bronchus.
 Repositioning recommended.
 2.  Focal prominence of the right hilum is nonspecific, and can be evaluated
 with dedicated chest CT on a nonemergent basis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Discussed with ___ on ___ at 12:10 PM.
