                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease. 
 However, no acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
