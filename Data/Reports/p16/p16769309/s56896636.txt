                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with productive cough, possible fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings are seen bilaterally; however,
 there is no confluent consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits, noting mildly tortuous aorta.  Mild hypertrophic
 changes seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs which can be seen in
 the setting of chronic lung disease, however, may also be due to mild
 interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation suggested.
