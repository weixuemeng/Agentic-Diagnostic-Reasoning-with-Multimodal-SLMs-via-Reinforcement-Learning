                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with profound diaphoresis  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Atelectasis is noted at the right lung base and within the left retrocardiac
 space.  Otherwise, there is no evidence for lobar consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits, allowing for technique and lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar and left retrocardiac atelectasis.
