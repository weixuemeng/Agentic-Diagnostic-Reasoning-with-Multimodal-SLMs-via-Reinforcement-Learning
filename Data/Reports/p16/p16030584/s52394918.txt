                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:41 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there may be very slight improvement at the left
 base, as the left hemidiaphragm is now slightly better defined.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.
