                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and CHF, now with positive blood culture.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.  
 
 There is moderately severe cardiomegaly. As before, the mediastinal silhouette
 is also quite prominent. There is patchy opacity at left greater than right
 bases.  The differential diagnosis includes pneumonic infiltrates.  There is
 upper zone redistribution.  Allowing for an under penetrated film, I doubt
 overt CHF.  No gross effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominence of both the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, similar to the
 film from one day earlier.
 
 2.  Patchy opacity both bases.  The differential diagnosis includes pneumonic
 infiltrates.
