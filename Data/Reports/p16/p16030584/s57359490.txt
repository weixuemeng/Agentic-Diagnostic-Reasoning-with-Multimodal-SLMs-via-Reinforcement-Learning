                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, exam consistent with pulmonary edema, question COPD pulmonary
 hypertension at ___, images not available.  Question COPD, CHF.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is possible background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  There is
 marked cardiomegaly.  There is patchy opacity at the right  greater than left
 lung bases, concerning for pneumonic infiltrate or area of aspiration.  The
 lungs are slightly better aerated than on the outside films from ___ dated
 ___.  The hila are prominent and could reflect the presence of pulmonary
 hypertension, but this should be best assessed on a PA view with good
 inspiration after resolution of the acute process.  Possibility of a
 superimposed component of CHF cannot be entirely excluded.  No gross effusion
 is identified, though the left costophrenic angle may be blunted.
