 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Radiopaque aortic valve replacement is noted.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Linear opacities in the right lower lobe likely
 represent basilar atelectasis.  There is blunting of the right greater than
 left posterior costophrenic angles which may represent trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top normal.  Median sternotomy wires are noted. Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right basilar atelectasis
 
 2.  Blunting of the right greater than left posterior costophrenic angles may
 be compatible with bilateral trace pleural effusions.
 
 3.  No focal consolidation.
