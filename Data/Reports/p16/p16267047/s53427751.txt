                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are again noted.  There
 is an asymmetric right basilar opacity which is also seen on the lateral view.
 Given the low lung volumes this may be due to atelectasis however an infection
 is not completely excluded.  The right midlung nodular opacity is again seen
 in different location when compared to prior, now no longer overlying the same
 rib and may represent a calcified granuloma.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear
 and there is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint right basilar opacity potentially due to atelectasis given the low lung
 volumes noting that infection is not excluded.
