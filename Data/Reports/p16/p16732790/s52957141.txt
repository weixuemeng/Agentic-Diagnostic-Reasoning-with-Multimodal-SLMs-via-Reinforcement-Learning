                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with episode agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis with minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle on the lateral view suggestive of a trace pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  Deformity of the right fourth rib
 posteriorly is unchanged and may reflect a remote fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
