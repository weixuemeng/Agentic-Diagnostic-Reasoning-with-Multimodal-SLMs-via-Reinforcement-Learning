                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF and chest pain, evaluate for acute cardiac
 versus pneumonia versus PE.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes.
 Port-A-Cath remains in unchanged position.  Cardiomediastinal contour is
 unchanged and again demonstrates minimal cardiomegaly.  Calcifications along
 the tracheobronchial tree and the aortic arch are also noted.  Linear
 opacities at the bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  Cephalization of the
 vessels suggests mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, new from the prior exam.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and unchanged small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2. Chest radiograph is not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary embolism
 and Chest CTA is recommended.
