                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and history of cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The examination is limited by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning.  The
 heart size is not well assessed on this lordotic view but appears enlarged. 
 There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with tip terminating in the lower IVC. 
 There is left greater than right small pleural effusions with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Perihilar vascular prominence is suggestive of fluid
 overload.  No acute bony abnormality is identified.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of congestive heart failure including apparent large heart
 size, small pleural effusions and prominent perihilar pulmonary vasculature.
