                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hematemesis in a patient with recent Billroth II
 surgery.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison with CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions appear to be slightly increased as well as there
 is slight interval progression of bibasal opacities, most likely reflecting
 areas of atelectasis, but infectious process is a possibility.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum seen on
 the current examination.
