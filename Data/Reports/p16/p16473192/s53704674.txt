                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ESRD, SLE, recent admission for RUE fistula
 infection here for new LUE swelling and pain.  // ? lung consolidation,
 cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate moderate cardiomegaly.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  A 1.1 x
 1.6 cm well-circumscribed oval opacity within the right upper lung zone
 peripherally appears calcified, no correlate on the lateral chest radiograph. 
 Unclear if this is within the lung parenchyma or alternatively to the
 overlying soft tissues.  Streaky opacity at the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No opacity convincing for pneumonia is seen.  Surgical clips
 project over the subcutaneous tissues of the arm on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Oval apparently calcified opacity projecting over the right upper lung
 zone on the frontal view is without a correlate on the lateral view.  Unclear
 if within the lung parenchyma.  Additional oblique views would be helpful for
 localization.
