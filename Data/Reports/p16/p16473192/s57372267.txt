 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 5.7 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below
 the diaphragm with tip in the gastric body, side port is in the region of the
 GE junction.  Lung volumes are lower and there is bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Right basilar focal opacity behind the heart may also be due to atelectasis
 though infection would be difficult to exclude.  There is superimposed mild
 pulmonary edema and a suspected small left pleural effusion. Degree of
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities which may be due
 to atelectasis though on the right, infection would be difficult to exclude.
 Enteric tube side port in the region of the GE junction and should be slightly
 advanced for optimal positioning.
