                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of renal cell carcinoma and recurrent
 right pleural effusions presents with dyspnea and right sided chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive pleural based metastatic lesions are again noted within the right
 hemi thorax, increased in size compared to the previous radiograph ___.  Additionally, there is a is small right pleural effusion, perhaps
 similar in size compared to the previous radiograph.  Worsening opacification
 within the right lung base may reflect increased atelectasis, but infection is
 not excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours otherwise appear
 unchanged.  Left lung remains clear without new focal consolidation.  There is
 no left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature does not appear engorged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive pleural based metastases within the right hemi thorax, increased in
 size compared to the previous radiograph.  Small right pleural effusion
 appears somewhat similar compared to the prior radiograph.  Worsening
 opacification in the right lung base may reflect increased atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.
