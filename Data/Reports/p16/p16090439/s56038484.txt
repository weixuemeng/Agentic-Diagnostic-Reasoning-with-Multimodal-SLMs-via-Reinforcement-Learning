                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with renal cell carcinoma on chemo w/ EKG changes from
 urgent care  // eval ? effusion, cardiomegaly, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear in vertically oriented opacity at the periphery of the right lung is
 suggestive of scarring, unchanged.  Additional more rounded opacities
 projecting over the lateral aspect of the right lung superiorly and at the
 midlung are likely pleural-based and are compatible with pleural-based tumor. 
 Low lung volumes are noted.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right-sided pleural based tumor
 and basilar scarring, as seen on CT scan from earlier the same day.
