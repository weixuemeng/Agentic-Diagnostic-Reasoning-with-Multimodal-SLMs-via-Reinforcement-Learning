                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC effusions s/p pleurodesis chest-tubes 
 // interval change.      interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ 11:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable erect chest film ___ at 09:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in pleural-based peripheral opacities in the right
 hemithorax favoring increasing loculated pleural fluid and associated adjacent
 atelectasis or consolidation. Possible loculated small right apical
 pneumothorax. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. Linear opacity at the
 left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pulmonary edema.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.
