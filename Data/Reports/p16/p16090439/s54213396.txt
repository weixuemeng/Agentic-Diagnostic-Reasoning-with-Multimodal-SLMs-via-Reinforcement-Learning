                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MPE (Met RCC) s/p thoracoscopy and talc
 pleurodesis ___ with apparent loculated effusion on CXR this AM. ___ CT
 placed  // ? PTX. tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the most recent on ___ at
 06:36 and chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with
 terminates over the right hemi thorax/ right upper abdomen. A chest tube is
 again seen in unchanged position.
 
 The size of a a large multiloculated right pleural effusion is stable compared
 to the prior examination done earlier this morning. No pneumothorax is
 identified. Opacity at the right base is consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion, also similar in extent. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable. The left lung appears clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter without significant
 interval change in the size of a large multiloculated right pleural effusion.
 Right basal opacity is most consistent with some compressive adjacent
 atelectasis.
