                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with aortic knob calcifications again demonstrated.  The patient is status
 post right upper lobectomy with fluid noted in the right upper hemithorax,
 similar to that seen on the prior CT.  There is no focal consolidation, new
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax otherwise demonstrated.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post right upper lobectomy with expected postoperative changes. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
