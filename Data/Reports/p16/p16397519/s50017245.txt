 FINDINGS:  A small loculated pleural fluid collection is present adjacent to
 the right lateral costophrenic sulcus and is new since ___ CT.  Appearance
 of right hemithorax is otherwise similar to previous chest CT, with post right
 upper lobe resection changes including loculated fluid and/or thickening at
 the right apex and reduced volume of the right lung.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable with moderate hiatal hernia.  Prominence of left pulmonary
 vascularity appears unchanged.  There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
 Fiducial seeds are observed within the imaged portion of the right upper
 abdomen.
