                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm from the carina.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but accentuated as result of
 low lung volumes.  Mediastinal widening is likely due to supine AP technique
 and low lung volumes.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  More focal patchy opacity in the
 retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration
 cannot be completely excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected on this supine exam.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  More focal retrocardiac
 opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.
