                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:56 a.m.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present -- the tip lies
 approximately 16 mm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- tip extends
 beneath the diaphragm, off film.  A right IJ central line is present, tip
 overlies distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due to rotation, but is
 not grossly enlarged.  Assessment of the hila is limited.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild vascular blurring, with thickening along the minor
 fissure, suggesting mild CHF.  There is atelectasis at the left base, similar
 to prior.  No gross effusion.  Aside from retrocardiac density, no frank
 consolidation identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube approximately 16 mm above the carina, relatively low.  Clinical
 correlation regarding possible slight retraction requested.
 
 2.  Other lines and tubes as described.
 
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis, with some patchy increased retrocardiac density.
 
 4.  Mild CHF.
