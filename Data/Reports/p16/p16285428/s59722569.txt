 FRONTAL SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm
 above the carina.  The upper enteric tube follows the expected course, with
 the side port in the stomach, although the tip is not seen.  The right
 subclavian catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are lower
 than on the prior study and the patient is rotated to the right.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is very mild. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged allowing for position and technique.
