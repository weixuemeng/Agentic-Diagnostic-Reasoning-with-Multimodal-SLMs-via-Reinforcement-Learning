                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is of normal size.  Slight rightward shift of the
 mediastinum is similar to prior, and likely due to thoracolumbar scoliosis. 
 Posterior costophrenic angles are minimally blunting and trace pleural
 effusions are not excluded.  Right base linear opacity is compatible with
 scarring.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascular
 markings are normal.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung base linear scarring with possible trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.
