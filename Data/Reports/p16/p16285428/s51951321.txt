                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although the left costophrenic
 angle is not included on the frontal view.  A band-like posterior opacity in
 the lower lobe is most consistent with atelectasis or scarring.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized,
 limiting visualization.  An irregular appearance to the right posterolateral
 eighth rib was not present before suggesting a new fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided eighth rib fracture without displacement.  No
 evidence of acute disease.
