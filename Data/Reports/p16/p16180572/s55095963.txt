                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with normal heart size. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The lungs are well
 expanded with relative paucity of pulmonary markings at the apices consistent
 with emphysema.  Patchy opacity at the right lung base is slightly improved
 but not completely resolved in may indicate superimposed infection or
 aspiration.  There is no pneumoperitoneum.  Mildly displaced right posterior
 rib fracture is better assessed on recent CT.
 
 Comparison to the prior outside hospital CT shows a nodular opacity at the
 right lower lobe measuring 2.3 x 1.4 cm (series 5a, image ___).  An ascending
 aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.5 cm is present.  Coronary artery disease is
 severe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval worsening of right base patchy opacity, consistent with infection
 or aspiration.
 2.Nodular opacity at the right lung base on recent CT, which may reflect
 pneumonia or aspiration.  However, lung cancer is a possibility.
 3.  Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.5 cm.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up chest CT 6 weeks after appropriate treatment for
 infection is recommended for further evaluation of nodular opacity in the
 right lower lobe.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:46 PM.
