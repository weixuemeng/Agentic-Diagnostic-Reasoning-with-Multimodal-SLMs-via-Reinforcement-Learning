 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much better
 inspiration.  There again is patchy opacification at the right base and
 probably left as well, which could represent merely atelectasis but is
 worrisome for superimposed aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 Otherwise little change.  Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
