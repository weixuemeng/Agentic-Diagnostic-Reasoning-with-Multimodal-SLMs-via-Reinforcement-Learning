                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M s/p fall, L posterior 7th rib fx and possible ___, ___
 and ___ fx  // r/o any new fx, r/o ptx and pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT scan dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are increasing patchy opacities and volume loss in the right lower lobe.
 Chronic coarsening of the reticular opacities and mild hyperinflation related
 to chronic pulmonary disease.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is
 unfolding and prominence on ascending thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions.  A minimally displaced posterior 6th rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing opacity and volume loss of the right lower lobe.  This likely
 represents worsening atelectasis, however superimposed aspiration or pneumonia
 can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
