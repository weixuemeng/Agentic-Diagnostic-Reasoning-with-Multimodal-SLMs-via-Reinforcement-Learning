                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M afib on coumadin s/p fall in shower with left posterior ___
 rib fracture and possible ___, ___, and ___ fractures  // interval change on
 xray re lung expansion and R mid opacity     interval change on xray re lung
 expansion and R mid opacity
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued
 heterogeneous opacification in the right mid zone consistent with pneumonia. 
 Opacification at the right base again is consistent with pleural fluid and
 atelectasis.
 Otherwise little change.
