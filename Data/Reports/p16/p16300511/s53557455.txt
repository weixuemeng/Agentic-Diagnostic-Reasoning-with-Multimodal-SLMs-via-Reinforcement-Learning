 INDICATION:  Smoke inhalation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  A
 plate-like opacity in the left lower lobe is probably due to atelectasis
 although not entirely specific.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity at the lung left lung base, not entirely specific although probably
 compatible with atelectasis.
