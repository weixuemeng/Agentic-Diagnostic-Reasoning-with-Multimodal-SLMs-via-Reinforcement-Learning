                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lupus and fever, cough malaise, few
 crackles at the bases  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No recent radiographs available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Heart size top-normal.  No pulmonary edema.  Vague
 increased density in the lower lung zones.  No pleural effusion.  No hilar
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague increased density in the bilateral lower lung zones may represent micro
 atelectasis (secondary to low lung volumes) or early airspace consolidation. 
 Unfortunately a pneumonic process cannot be excluded with absolute certainty
 and clinical correlation is advised.
