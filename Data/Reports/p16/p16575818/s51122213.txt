 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ? aspiration  // eval for aspiration pneumoitis
 or pnuemonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle increase in opacity along the medial right lung base may be due to
 overlapping vascular structures although a subtle aspiration is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting. No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle patchy opacity at the medial right lung base best seen on the frontal
 view may be due to overlap of vascular structures although underlying
 aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
