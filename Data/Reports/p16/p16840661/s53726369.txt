                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib pain following cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are high, with
 flattening of the diaphragms, most compatible with chronic obstructive lung
 disease.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits and unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.  There is mild basilar platelike atelectasis or scarring.  No
 fractures are detected, although sensitivity for osseous injury is limited
 with this technique.  Wedge compression deformities are again seen at the
 lower thoracic spine.  Posterior lumbar fusion hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis/scarring. No definite rib fracture.
