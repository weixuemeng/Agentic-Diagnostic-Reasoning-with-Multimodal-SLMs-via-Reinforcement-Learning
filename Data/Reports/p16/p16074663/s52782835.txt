                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and hepatitis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Single frontal view shows some enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  This
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
