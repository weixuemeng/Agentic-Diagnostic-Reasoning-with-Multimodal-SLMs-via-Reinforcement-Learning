                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity appear similar compared
 to the previous study, potentially atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Bronchovascular structures are crowded due to low lung volumes without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac patchy opacity likely reflects atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
