                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Right fourth rib pain in the axial after a fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild to
 moderate cardiac enlargement including a left ventricular configuration.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  Streaky scarring in the lingula is unchanged. 
 Fissures are  slightly thickened, which is somewhat increased suggesting mild
 vascular congestion.  There is a new trace pleural effusion on the left. 
 Slight pleural thickening of the right is probably unchanged.  Increased
 interstitial opacity in the right lower lung, although regional, may represent
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  No definite fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild vascular congestion.  No definite rib fracture
 identified.  Dedicated rib series would be more sensitive to detect rib
 fracture if needed clinically.
