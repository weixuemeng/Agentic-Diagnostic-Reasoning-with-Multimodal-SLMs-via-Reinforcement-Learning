                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ICD  // eval for lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ICD is in place.  1 lead overlies right atrium AND AN other overlies the
 right ventricle.  The third lead courses posteriorly and lies in the expected
 location of the coronary sinus.
 
 There is a small effusion at the right costophrenic angle.  There is probable
 atelectasis with a small curvilinear sliver of air in between.  This is less
 likely to represent a RIGHT LUNG BASE pneumothorax, as there is no
 corresponding abnormality on the lateral view.  Left costophrenic sulcus is
 clear.
 
 No overt CHF or focal infiltrate identified.  No apical pneumothorax detected.
 
 Background hyperinflation likely present, similar to prior
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ICD leads over right atrium, right ventricle, and in region of coronary sinus.
 
 Probable atelectasis and small right pleural effusion new or more pronounced
 than on ___.  Right lung base pneumothorax is considered much less
 likely.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
