                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with multiple rib fractures and small left
 pneumothorax.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study CTA ___.
 
 Small left pneumothorax is better seen in prior CT.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are midline.  Cardiac size is normal.  Multiple left rib fractures
 are again noted.  Small left effusion has increased.  Left basal opacities
 have increased, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration.  Opacities in the
 right lower lobe are grossly unchanged.
