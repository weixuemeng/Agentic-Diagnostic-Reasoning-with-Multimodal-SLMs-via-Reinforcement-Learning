 Streaky opacity in the right lower lung is likely atelectasis.  Interstitial
 abnormality most prominent at the left base likely reflects combination of
 atelectasis and emphysema. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is chronic elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There is no pneumothorax.

 Bibasilar atelectasis and severe emphysema better depicted on prior chest CT.
