                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure, status post intubation and
 bronchoscopy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:25 p.m.
 
 There remains essentially complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with
 leftward shift of the mediastinum.  Small linear branching lucencies in the
 left mid zone are newly visible on this exam.  Otherwise, no significant
 interval change.  
 
 A new ET tube is present, but the carina is difficult to define -- the ETT tip
 may lie approximately 6 cm above the carina. The left subclavian PICC line tip
 is unchanged, overlying the proximal SVC.  An electrode-type device now
 overlies the upper left lung near the thoracic inlet.  Tubing/catheter seen
 over the upper abdomen, with tip overlying uppermost left abdomen, unchanged.
 
 Incidental note is made of dense bilateral carotid artery calcification and
 degenerative changes in the cervical spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially no change in complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax and leftward shift of the mediastinum.
