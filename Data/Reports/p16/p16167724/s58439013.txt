                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Squamous cell carcinoma, now increased hypoxia, question worsening
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Compared with film from ___ at 4:30 a.m., there is now new complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax, with apparent shift of mediastinum to
 the left.  The possibility of elevation of the hemidiaphragm cannot be
 excluded, as it is obscured on this film.  The right lung shows some faint
 opacity at the base medially, presumably atelectasis.  Previously seen small
 right effusion is not currently visible.  No CHF demonstrated in the right
 lung. 
 
 A left PICC line is present, location of the tip is unchanged and presumably
 relates to the proximal SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  Note is made of two
 subsequent chest x-rays currently on PACS, the most recent of which
 demonstrates marked improvement in the left lung opacity.  Please see separate
 reports from those exams.
