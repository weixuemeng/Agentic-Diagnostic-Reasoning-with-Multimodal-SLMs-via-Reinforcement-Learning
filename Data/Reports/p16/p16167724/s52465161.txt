                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth, recurrent aspiration, left
 lung whiteout, status post bronch.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 23:46 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, there has been considerable improvement in the
 appearance of the left lung.  Much of the lung is now well aerated.  Some
 residual faint opacity is seen in the mid and lower zones, with increased
 retrocardiac density.  This likely reflects a combination of residual
 atelectasis and/or small amount of residual pleural fluid.  The possibility of
 an underlying pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.  There does
 appear to be some residual volume loss on the left, with slight leftward shift
 of the mediastinum.  Again seen is some opacity in the right
 infrahilar/cardiophrenic region, ? atelectasis.  No right-sided effusion. 
 Doubt overt CHF.  
 
 ET tube tip at the level of the midclavicular heads, approximately 7 cm above
 the carina.  PICC line grossly unchanged. Abdominal catheter or tube again
 noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked interval improvement in the appearance of the left lung.
