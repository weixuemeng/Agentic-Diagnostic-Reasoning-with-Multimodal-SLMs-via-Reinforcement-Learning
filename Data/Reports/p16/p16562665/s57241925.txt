                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R VATS blebectomy/pleurodesis for recurrent
 PTX  // r/o ptx, htx (obtain ___ at 0500h)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right lung makes it difficult to assess
 for subtle pneumothorax.  The possibility of a small right apical pneumothorax
 cannot be excluded, particularly in light of a thin linear density along the
 superolateral right chest wall.  There are also known bullous changes at the
 right lung apex.  There is only mild patchy opacity at the right lung base,
 consistent with atelectasis.  This includes changes in the right cardiophrenic
 region, which are slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.  Equivocal
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Right pigtail catheter
 remains in place.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Left lung remains
 grossly clear, without CHF or focal infiltrate.  Minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base.  No gross effusion.  Bullous
 change in the right paratracheal region.  No obvious pneumothorax on the left.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for obscuration by overlying subcutaneous emphysema, a small right
 apical pneumothorax is suspected.  This could be slightly larger than on the
 prior study.  This is, however, is difficult to confidently assess due to
 overlying subcutaneous emphysema and right apical bullous change.
 
 Otherwise, the overall appearance is quite similar.  Patchy atelectasis and/or
 scarring at the right cardiophrenic angle is again seen, slightly more
 pronounced.  Doubt CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion.
