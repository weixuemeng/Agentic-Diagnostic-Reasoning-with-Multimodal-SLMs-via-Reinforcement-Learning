                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p blebectomy + pleurodesis s/p ___ CT placement  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 12:25, the small right apical pneumothorax
 remains visible, but is very slightly smaller.  Again seen is the right
 pigtail catheter overlying the lateral upper lateral right chest and the right
 chest tube.  Also again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema overlying the
 right hand to a small extent the right chest and, to a small extent, the left
 axilla.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Retrocardiac left base
 atelectasis is slightly increased.  Right cardiophrenic atelectasis is
 slightly improved.  No CHF.  No gross effusions, though small bilateral
 effusions would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight interval increase in the right apical pneumothorax.  A small
 residual pneumothorax remains visible.
 2. Right-sided catheter and chest tube in place, similar to the prior study. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema again noted.
 3. Bibasilar atelectasis, with Tesla interval increase on the left and slight
 interval improvement on the right.
