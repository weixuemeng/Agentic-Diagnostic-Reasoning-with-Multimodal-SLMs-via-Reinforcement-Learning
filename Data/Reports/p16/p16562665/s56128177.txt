 reaccumulation of the right-sided pneumothorax is seen.  Mild pleural
 thickening at the right costophrenic angle.  Retrocardiac opacity and air
 bronchograms are noted at the left lower lobe, possibly reflecting chronic
 atelectasis and scarring but acute infection cannot be excluded.  Correlation
