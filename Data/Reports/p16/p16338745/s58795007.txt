                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  A moderately extensive opacity at least predominantly
 localizing to the anterior segment of the left upper lobe suggests pneumonia. 
 Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most consistent with pneumonia in the left upper lobe.
