                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for an acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is a mild diffuse interstitial abnormality, which can be seen in
 the setting of chronic lung disease. There is a 3.5 cm cystic lesion in the
 right upper lobe, unchanged. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal
 airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Heart is normal size. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 There are severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint.
 Deformity of the right humerus may reflect prior fracture, however, this is
 incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Increased interstitial abnormality likely reflects colonic lung disease,
 however, nonemergent high-resolution chest CT could be considered.  The right
 upper lobe cystic abnormality could be evaluated at that time as well.
