 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are now moderate-sized bilateral layering effusions with patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities suggestive of compressive lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable, although cardiac size is difficult to assess due to the pleural
 effusions.
