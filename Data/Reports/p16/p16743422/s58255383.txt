                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough for two months with yellow phlegm.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, most likely
 reflecting pleural thickening.  Some atelectatic changes are seen at the
 bases.  However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  
 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged without vascular congestion.
