 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:19 PM
  Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with stable atelectasis.  Some
  tenting and blunting of the right hemidiaphragm is likely from some scarring. 
  A small right effusion cannot be completely excluded.  Increased pulmonary
  vasculature and interstitial prominence is likely from mild pulmonary edema. 
  In the right infrahilar region, increased opacification is likely from
  prominent vessels and some atelectasis, though attention on follow-up exams is
  recommended to exclude developing infection.  Stable cardiomegaly and
  extensive pericardial thickening/calcification.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate possible consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, heavy pericardial calcification, and pulmonary vascular
 congestion are chronic.  Mild interstitial abnormality is new, possibly edema,
 there is no pleural effusion.  Greater opacification in the infrahilar right
 lung could be atelectasis, and there is a wedge-shaped area of possible
 consolidation at the right lung apex.  Oblique views should be obtained to see
 if we can determine whether there is good radiographic evidence of pneumonia,
 and if the findings of that study are equivocal, I would endorse chest CT
 scanning immediately.
