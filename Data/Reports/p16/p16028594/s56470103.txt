                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Likely DKA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, as also seen previously, with blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle, similar in appearance to the prior study from
 ___.  Mitral annulus calcification is seen.  There is mild right base
 atelectasis.  Subtle right base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis,
 although an early infectious process is not entirely excluded.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild right base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis,
 although an infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle with overlying atelectasis/scarring.
