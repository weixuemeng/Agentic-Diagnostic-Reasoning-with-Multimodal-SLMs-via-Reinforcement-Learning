 pre-existing right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in extent but still
 occupies a substantial part of the right hemithorax.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left
 lung. No pulmonary edema.  Non-characteristic atelectasis in the retrocardiac
 lung regions.
