                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___,
 right shoulder radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  3.4 cm rounded opacity
 within the right middle lobe corresponds to the mass seen on previous CT. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Chronic bilateral rib fractures are again demonstrated as well as a healed
 fracture of the right proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Re- demonstration of right
 middle lobe mass, better seen on recent CT.
