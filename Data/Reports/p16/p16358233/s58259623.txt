                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 HISTORY:  History of pneumonia.  Prescribed Zithromax, but did not take meds,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis may also be
 present.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  On the frontal view,
 there is an ill-defined somewhat rounded opacity in the lateral right
 mid-to-lower lung, difficult on this study to discern whether osseous or
 pulmonary in nature due to the overlying soft tissue.  Consider oblique views
 or outpatient CT for further evaluation.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 Rhere is suggestion of old anterior right seventh rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate interstitial edema.  Cardiomegaly.
 2.  Ill-defined rounded opacity measuring approximately 1 cm projecting over
 the lateral mid-to-lower lung, difficult to discern whether osseous or
 pulmonary in nature particularly given underpenetration due to patient's body
 habitus.  Suggest oblique views or nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.
