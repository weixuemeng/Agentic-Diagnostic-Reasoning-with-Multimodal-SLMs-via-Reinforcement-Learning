                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rigors, immunosuppressed on chemo, concern
 for possible pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contour is similar.  Right middle lobe mass is again noted, as seen on the
 previous exam.  Mild pulmonary edema is new in the interval.  Additionally,
 patchy ill-defined opacities are seen in the lung bases, also progressed since
 the previous study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Focal
 areas of right lateral pleural thickening with adjacent chronic rib fractures
 are again noted.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are also again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Worsening ill-defined patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded.
 3. Re- demonstration of right middle lobe mass.
