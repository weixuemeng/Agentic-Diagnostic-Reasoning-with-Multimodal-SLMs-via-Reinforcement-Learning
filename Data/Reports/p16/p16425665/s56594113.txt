                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is a relatively focal patchy
 opacity projecting over the right upper lung.  Additionally, there is a patchy
 opacity projecting over the right lung apex.  The left lung is grossly clear. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal with possible mitral annulus
 calcification.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Surgical clips in the right
 upper quadrant are presumed from prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical opacity of unclear etiology or chronicity. 
 Correlate with any history of tuberculosis.  Additional small patchy opacity
 in the more inferior right upper lung could be due to additional site of
 infection or inflammation.  Pulmonary contusion not excluded in the setting of
 trauma.  No definite displaced fracture identified, however, CT is more
 sensitive.
