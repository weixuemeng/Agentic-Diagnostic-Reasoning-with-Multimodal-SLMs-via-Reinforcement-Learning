                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is upward retraction of the hila related to fibrotic
 changes in the apices, most likely reflecting old granulomatous disease. 
 However, no acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
