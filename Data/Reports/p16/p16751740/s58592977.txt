                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:37 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after middle cerebral artery coiling.  New left
 subclavian line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 11:38 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the new left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, or ipsilateral mediastinal widening.  A right upper
 paramediastinal fluid collection, either pleural or extrapleural fluid, is
 more localized medially.  Viewed prospectively, it would have raised concern
 for local bleeding, but subsequent chest radiographs through ___ at 4:39
 a.m. available at the time of this review showed improvement.  Its precise
 nature is indeterminate, and dependent on clinical history, (unfortunately)
 not provided with this imaging request.  New opacification projecting over the
 entire right hemithorax is probably a combination of posteriorly layering
 pleural effusion, persistent right lower lobe collapse, and new edema or
 atelectasis in the upper lobe.  Of these only right lower lobe collapse is
 still present as of ___ at 4:39 a.m.:
 
 ET tube is in standard placement at the thoracic inlet, and upper enteric
 drainage tube ends in the stomach.  Left lung is clear, and the heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
