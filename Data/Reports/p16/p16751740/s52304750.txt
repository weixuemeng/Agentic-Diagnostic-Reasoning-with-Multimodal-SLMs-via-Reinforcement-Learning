                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with status epileticus, intubated for airway
 protection.  // evaluate ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable. New patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect focal atelectasis or aspiration, but short-term followup radiographs
 may be helpful to exclude infection.
