 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC, having been slightly
 withdrawn in the interval.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 Diffuse pulmonary opacities are progressed, consistent with progression of
 pulmonary edema.  No definite pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous
 structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC terminates in mid-to-lower SVC following partial
 withdrawal.  Progression of bilateral opacities consistent with worsening
 pulmonary edema.
