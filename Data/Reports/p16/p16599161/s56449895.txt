                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CABG, AVR, question resolution of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer.  Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, nasogastric
 tube, endotracheal tube and left chest tube are unchanged.  Left-sided pacer
 remains in place.  Lung volumes remain low.  There are likely small layering
 effusions, left greater than right, with associated retrocardiac consolidation
 likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There has been interval appearance of mild perihilar edema.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax
 is somewhat diminished given supine technique.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable in this post-operative patient status
 post median sternotomy for CABG.
