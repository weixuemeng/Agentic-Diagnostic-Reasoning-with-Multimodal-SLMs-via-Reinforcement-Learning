                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with endotracheal tube, check position after
 adjustment and evaluate for mediastinal widening.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 847.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.
 The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, left chest tube and left pacer
 are likely unchanged in position.  There is a nasogastric tube coursing below
 the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Lung volumes remain markedly
 diminished with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable in this post-operative patient status post
 median sternotomy for CABG.
