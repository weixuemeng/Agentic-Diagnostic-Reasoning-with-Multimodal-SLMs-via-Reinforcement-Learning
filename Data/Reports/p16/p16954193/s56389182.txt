                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GI bleed (likely diverticular), colitis,
 rising white blood cell count  // R/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to prior examination dated ___, there has been no
 significant interval change. Again, the lungs are hyperexpanded bilaterally
 with flattening of the hemidiaphragms and apical scarring, compatible with
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Redemonstrated is a right apical
 airspace consolidation. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. A large hiatal hernia is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe airspace consolidation, compatible with pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Recommend followup chest radiographs in 4 weeks
 following appropriate therapy to document resolution.
