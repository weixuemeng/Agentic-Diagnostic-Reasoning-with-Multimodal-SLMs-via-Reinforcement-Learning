                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right upper lobe opacity, similar to ___ examinations. There is subtle increase in opacity at the right and left
 lung bases, possibly reflecting atelectasis, though underlying new
 consolidations cannot be entirely excluded. There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged right upper lobe opacity. If this does not resolve following
 treatment, a CT examination should be considered.
 2. New subtle right and left bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 though early consolidations cannot be excluded.
