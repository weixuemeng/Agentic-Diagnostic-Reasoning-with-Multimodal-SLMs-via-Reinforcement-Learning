                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 within normal limits.  Prominence of the right mediastinum may be due to
 tortuous vessels but is not well evaluated.  Hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
 2.  Prominence at the right mediastinum.  This most likely due to tortuous
 vessels but could be further evaluated with CT if clinically indicated. Since
 chronicity is unknown, if clinical suspicion for ascenidng aortic aneurysm, is
 high, do CT
