                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right fight with assault to chest.  Left chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest. 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is patchy opacity at both bases, which
 presumably represents atelectasis. No frank consolidation.  There is no chf,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragms.  No rib
 fracture identified on these lung-technique films.  
 
 IMPRESSION:   Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 acute pulmonary process identified.
