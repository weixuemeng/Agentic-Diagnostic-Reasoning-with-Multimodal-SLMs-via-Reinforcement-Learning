 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral crackles.  Suspect CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has increased since ___.  There is, however, no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, interstitial edema, or appreciable pleural
 effusion.  Mediastinal veins have increased in caliber only moderately. 
 Differential diagnosis of the interval changes is right heart failure or new
 pericardial effusion.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified and somewhat
 tortuous but not clearly aneurysmal.  Heavy atherosclerotic calcified plaque
 is seen on the lateral view at the origin of the head and neck vessels.
