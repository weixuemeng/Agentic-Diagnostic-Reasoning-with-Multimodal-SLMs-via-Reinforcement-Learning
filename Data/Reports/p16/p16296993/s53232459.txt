                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of asthma and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 Exam is limited due to poor inspiratory effort and AP technique.  Within this
 limitation, there is no large confluent consolidation identified. 
 Costophrenic angles are sharp and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to poor inspiratory effort, no definite large
 confluent consolidation, however.  If desired, repeat with better inspiratory
 effort can be performed.
