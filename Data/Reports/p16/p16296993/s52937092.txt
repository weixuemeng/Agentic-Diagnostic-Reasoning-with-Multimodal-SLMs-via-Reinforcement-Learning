                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta and calcification along the arch.  Patchy linear opacification
 in the left lower lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a prominent epicardial fat pad
 near the cardiac apex.  Mild leftward convex curvature is noted along the
 thoracic spine with mild degenerative changes.  The bones appear probably
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
