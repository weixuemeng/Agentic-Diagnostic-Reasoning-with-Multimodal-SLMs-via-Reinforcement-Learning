                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and crackles.  History of congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is again calcified
 with similar unfolding.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is again a small eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minimal atelectasis.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion, although small
 pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
