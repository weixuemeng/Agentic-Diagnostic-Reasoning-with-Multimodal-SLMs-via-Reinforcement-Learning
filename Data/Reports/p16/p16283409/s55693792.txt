                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low with persistent moderate relative elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right side.  Patchy opacities in the
 lower lungs can probably be attributed to atelectasis in that setting. 
 Limitations of technique makes it difficult to exclude subtle pneumonia,
 however.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity, which can probably be attributed to
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, although it is difficult to
 completely exclude pneumonia.
