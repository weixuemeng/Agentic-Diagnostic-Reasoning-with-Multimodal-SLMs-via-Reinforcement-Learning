 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, there
 is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying mild basilar
 atelectasis.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  The previously seen left lower
 lobe opacity is less apparent and has essentially resolved.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
