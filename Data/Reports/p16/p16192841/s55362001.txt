                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing shortness of breath, new oxygen
 requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears normal.  The mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 Prominence of both hila may reflect underlying lymphadenopathy. Extensive
 nodular opacities are noted diffusely in both lungs, but particularly within
 the lung periphery.  More focal opacity within the right lung base could
 reflect an area of infection.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is also likely present. Gaseous distention of
 colonic loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse nodular opacities in both lungs concerning for widespread metastatic
 disease.  More focal opacity in the right lung base could reflect an area of
 developing infection.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Correlation with any previous imaging or history of malignancy is recommended,
 and if there is no recent chest CT performed or known diagnosis of metastatic
 disease, a chest CT should performed.
