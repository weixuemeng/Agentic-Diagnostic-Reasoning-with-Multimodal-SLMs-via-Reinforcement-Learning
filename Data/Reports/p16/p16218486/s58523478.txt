                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough and hypotension  // eval infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low. Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is again noted. Left lung base is poorly assessed. The mid upper
 lungs appear well aerated. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size
 appears enlarged of the right heart border is obscured. Mediastinal contour
 stable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Suboptimal assessment of the left
 lung base. Otherwise unremarkable. Consider dedicated PA and lateral
 radiographs with more optimal inspiratory effort to better assess.
