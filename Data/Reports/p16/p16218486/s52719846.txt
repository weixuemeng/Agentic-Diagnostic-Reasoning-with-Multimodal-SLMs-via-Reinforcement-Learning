                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm has further increased.  As a consequence,
 an atelectatic zone of right basal lung parenchyma is seen, notably on the
 lateral image.  This zone has already existed on occasion of a previous CT
 examination from ___.  It is not possible to radiographically
 determine whether this atelectatic zone also contains infectious components.
 
 In the well-ventilated lung areas, however, there currently is no evidence of
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette, mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
