                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and sore throat.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are streaky
 posterior basilar opacities in the left lower lobe and probably in the lingula
 which are more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia, although an
 infectious process is difficult to completely exclude.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the mid thoracic spine with slight
 minimal wedging of mid thoracic vertebral bodies that appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacities, more suggestive of atelectasis
 than pneumonia, although an infectious etiology is difficult to entirely
 exclude.
