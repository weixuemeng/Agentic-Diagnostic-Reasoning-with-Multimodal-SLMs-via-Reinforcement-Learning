 INDICATION:  Evaluation of pleural effusion in patient with dyspnea and
 wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 most recent prior, on the frontal view, the costophrenic angles are sharper,
 however, on the lateral view the bilateral pleural effusion appear relatively
 unchanged.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions appear improved on the frontal
 view and unchanged on the lateral view.
