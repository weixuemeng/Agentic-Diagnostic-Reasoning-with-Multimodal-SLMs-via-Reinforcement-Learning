                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and worsening oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 00:26.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is an
 increased diffuse interstitial abnormality consistent with worsening pulmonary
 edema.  Additionally, there is increased opacification at the right base which
 may be due to a consolidation, atelectasis or asymmetric edema.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are moderate in size, and have increased since the prior
 exam.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The heart remains moderately
 enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening pulmonary edema, which is now moderate.
 2.  Increased opacification at the right base may represent pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Alternatively, may be due to atelectasis or
 asymmetric edema.
 3.  Increase in size of bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
