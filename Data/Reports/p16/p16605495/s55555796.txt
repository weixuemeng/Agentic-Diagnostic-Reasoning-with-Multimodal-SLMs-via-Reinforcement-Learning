                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever.  Assess for infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 0 ___, ox ___ ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bibasilar, left
 greater than right, opacities better assessed on same day CT abdomen and
 pelvis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal
 contour, and hila are unremarkable.  The aorta is tortuous.
 Visualized osseous structures are notable for chronic deformity of the right
 humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar, left greater than right, opacities, most
 consistent with atelectasis and possible chronic aspiration, better assessed
 on same-day CT abdomen and pelvis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation recommended to assess for infection.
