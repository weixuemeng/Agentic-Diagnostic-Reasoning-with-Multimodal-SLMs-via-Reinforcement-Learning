                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and same-day CT abdomen pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views the chest provided.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion with bilateral lower lobe and left perihilar consolidations
 likely representing atelectasis, though difficult to exclude a component of
 pneumonia.  There is no overt edema.  No large pneumothorax.  Heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  Chronic deformity of
 the right humeral neck noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar and left perihilar opacities likely atelectasis versus pneumonia. 
 No overt edema.
