 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  EMS, leukocytosis, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  No
 pleural effusions.  No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  A
 lucent line seen projecting over the upper right hemithorax continues over the
 midline and the left lung apex and is likely caused by either a skinfold or a
 foreign object outside of the patient.
