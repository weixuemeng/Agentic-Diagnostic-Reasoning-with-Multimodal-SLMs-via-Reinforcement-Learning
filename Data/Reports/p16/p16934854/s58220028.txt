                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lungs are
 grossly clear except for a minimal area of increased opacity in left
 retrocardiac region, which most likely represents localized atelectasis. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Increased lung volumes
 suggest underlying COPD.
