                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP view of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen compared
 to prior.  There are bibasilar opacities with more dense consolidation
 identified in the retrocardiac region which silhouettes the descending
 thoracic aorta and medial hemidiaphragm.  Superiorly the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged given differences in positioning and
 technique.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities, more confluent at the left lung base compared to the
 right.  Although a component of this may be due to atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is also possible particularly on the left.  PA and lateral views
 with improved inspiratory effort may help further characterize if desired.
