                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slight decrease in
 the opacification at the right base with continued opacification at the left. 
 These findings are consistent with atelectasis, though the possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Monitoring and support devices remain in standard position.
