                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is similar moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 compared to the left.  A prominent pericardial fat pad is again noted along
 the left apex, obscuring the costophrenic sulcus, and accordingly making it
 difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion.  There is no evidence for
 pleural effusion on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.  Although right
 basilar opacity has mostly resolved, leaving only a streaky residual linear
 opacity suggesting minor scarring or atelectasis, there is a patchy new
 retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe, raising concern for pneumonia. 
 Atelectasis would be a differential consideration, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe, non-specific possibly due
 to pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
