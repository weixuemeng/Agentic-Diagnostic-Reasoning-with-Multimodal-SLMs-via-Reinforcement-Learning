                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Bibasilar opacities have markedly improved consistent with improving
 aspiration pneumonia.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly is difficult
 to evaluate given the projection and low lung volumes.  Left IJ catheter tip
 is in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
