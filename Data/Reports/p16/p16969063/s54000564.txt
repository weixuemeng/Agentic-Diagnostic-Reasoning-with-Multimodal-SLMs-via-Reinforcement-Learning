                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There are low lung volumes.  Linear opacities in bilateral
 lung bases once again likely represent atelectases.  No pneumothoraces are
 seen.  Small pleural effusion may be seen on the left side or this maybe
 related to pericardial fat.  Bones appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes.  If clinical
 suspicion for pneumonia is high, suggest repeat PA and lateral views with
 better inspiration.
