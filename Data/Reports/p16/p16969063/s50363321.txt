                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Long hospital stay with frequent suctioning and worsening hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change
 and no evidence of acute abnormality.  Atelectatic changes are again seen in
 the left base with otherwise little change.  Displacement of the lower
 cervical trachea to the right is again seen, consistent with thyroid
 enlargement seen on a prior CT scan.
