                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 measures approximately 5.6 cm above the carina.  Left IJ catheter tip is at
 the mid portion of the SVC.
 
 Continued opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the
 hemidiaphragm.  This is worrisome for aspiration pneumonia, though atelectasis
 and small effusion could present a similar pattern.  There is again
 retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe
 with probable associated pleural effusion.
 
 Mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels could reflect some element of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
