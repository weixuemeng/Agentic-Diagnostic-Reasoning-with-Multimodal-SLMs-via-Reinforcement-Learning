                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  The patient's chin
 overlies the left lung apex, partially obscuring the view.There are low lung
 volumes.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is stable and most likely due to overlying soft tissue, although an
 underlying small pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  Right base
 atelectasis is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
