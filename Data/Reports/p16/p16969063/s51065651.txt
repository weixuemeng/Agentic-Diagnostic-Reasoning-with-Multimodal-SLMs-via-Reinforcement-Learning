                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature shows upper zone redistribution with indistinct margins suggesting
 mild vascular congestion.  There is also more focal but vague patchy
 opacification at the left lung base, the latter possibly atelectasis.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate
 right-sided diaphragmatic elevation appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild vascular congestion.  Patchy left basilar opacification,
 which is probably compatible with atelectasis but the possibility of infection
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  In that event
 short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
