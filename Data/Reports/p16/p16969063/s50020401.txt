                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  Lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating heart size, which is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Undulating contours of aortic calcifications could represent an
 ectatic aorta.  Retrocardiac and right lung base linear opacities are
 compatible with atelectasis.  Indistinct appearance of the left costophrenic
 angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and possible small left
 pleural effusion.  
 2.  Heavily calcified and tortuous aorta, which could be re-evaluated with
 conventional radiographs.
