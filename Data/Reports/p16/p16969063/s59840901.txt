                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with PICC line has been pulled back 1-2 cm. 
 Evaluation for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ at time 09:16.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval repositioning
 of the right PICC line which now terminates in the low SVC.  Previously
 demonstrated left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged since the prior
 radiograph.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval repositioning of right PICC line which now terminates in
 the low SVC.  Otherwise, unchanged since the prior study.
