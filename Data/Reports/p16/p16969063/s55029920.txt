                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory failure.  Assess for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm
 above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is positioned within the stomach. 
 Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The heart
 size is top normal.  Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis. 
 No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and bibasilar
 opacities, most likely atelectasis have been present for at least several
 months.
