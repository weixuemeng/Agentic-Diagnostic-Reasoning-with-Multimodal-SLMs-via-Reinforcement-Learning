                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON STUDY:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increase in degree of right hemidiaphragm elevation is accompanied
 by opacity in the right retrocardiac area which likely represents atelectasis
 given a combination of diaphragmatic elevation and inferior right hilar
 displacement.  Left lung is grossly clear except for minimal linear
 atelectasis at the base.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 positional differences between the exams.  Left superior mediastinal widening
 with tracheal deviation is consistent with known thyroid lesion on prior CT
 torso.
