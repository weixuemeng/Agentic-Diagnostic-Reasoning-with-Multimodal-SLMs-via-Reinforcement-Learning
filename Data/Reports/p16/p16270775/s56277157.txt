                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits.
 Within the limitations of AP portable technique including with low lung
 volumes, the right lung is probably clear.  However, opacity projecting over
 the mid to upper lung is concerning for pneumonia. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the left lung.
