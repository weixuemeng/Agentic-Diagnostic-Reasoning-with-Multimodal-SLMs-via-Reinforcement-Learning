                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable supine frontal view of the chest.  
 
 The patient is very rotated.  The lung bases are almost uninterpretable given
 the low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Supine positioning is
 contributing to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung bases are almost uninterpretable given the low lung volumes and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Supine positioning is contributing to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Recommend repeat chest radiographs with emphasis on good
 inspiratory effort to assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
