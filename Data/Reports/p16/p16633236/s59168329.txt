                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question acute process.  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, suggesting the likelihood that streaky
 left basilar opacities constitute minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 at the upper limits of normal size.  There is slight unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 osseous structures show minimal degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
