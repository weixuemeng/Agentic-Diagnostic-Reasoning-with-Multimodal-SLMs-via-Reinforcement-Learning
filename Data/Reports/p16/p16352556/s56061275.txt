                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with congenital heart history  // eval for lead
 and generator
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pericardial leads are present terminating overlying the anterior right
 ventricle and a second more posteriorly. Lungs are well expanded and clear. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Small diameter sternotomy wires are
 consistent with history of congenital heart history, the most inferior of
 which is fractured. A lobulated contour of the right heart border and middle
 mediastinum is of unclear significance without priors for comparison, likely
 due to congenital history.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pericardial leads are present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
