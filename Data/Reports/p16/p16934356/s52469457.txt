                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hoarseness, cough, weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is a nonspecific area of increased
 opacity projecting over the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view, which
 abuts a slightly anteriorly displaced right major fissure.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Note is made
 of a healed right upper rib fracture. There are degenerative changes along the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Short radiographic followup within six to eight weeks is
 recommended to document resolution, in order to exclude a neoplastic process.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 11:00 AM, time of discovery.
