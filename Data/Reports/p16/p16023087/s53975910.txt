                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with behavioral change, wheezing, and new oxygen
 requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.  There is mild
 interstitial edema.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart and mediastinal
 contours; there is likely underlying mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Increased density at the right lung base likely represents
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized right pleural effusion and mild interstitial
 edema.  Increased density at the right lung base, likely atelectasis, but
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Follow-up imaging after treatment is
 recommended. 
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by
 ___ by telephone at 3:15 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial
 review of the study.
