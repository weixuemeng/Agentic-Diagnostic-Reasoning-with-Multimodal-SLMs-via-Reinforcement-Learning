                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:15 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with schizophrenia and altered mental
 status, question infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 14:31.
 
 A single portable AP chest film, ___ at 8:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes with layering right effusion and patchy
 opacity at the right base most likely representing compressive atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Assessment of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours is challenging given patient rotation on the current
 examination.  There is prominence of the ascending aorta, which could just
 reflect an unfolded tortuous aorta, but raises the possibility of an ascending
 aortic aneurysm.  Correlation with the patient's more remote chest films would
 be advised.  Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the vasculature and no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No
 pneumothorax.
