                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Steady decline in mental status over the last month.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, in unchanged positions.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacities in the
 lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen, and no focal consolidation is demonstrated.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine with anterior bridging
 osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
