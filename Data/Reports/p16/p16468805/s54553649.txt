                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A poorly defined area of consolidation within the lateral segment
 of the right middle lobe appears similar compared to the previous study from
 earlier the same date performed at ___, but is improved in
 extent when compared to an older radiograph from ___ on ___.  There
 remains bronchial wall thickening and adjacent streaky peribronchiolar
 opacities in the right lower lobe on the lateral view, which may reflect
 additional involvement in the right lower lobe by this infectious process. 
 Minimal heterogeneous opacities in right upper lobe are also again
 demonstrated.  Remainder of the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal right lung anormalities, likely multifocal ifnection,
 have improved since a prior radiograph of six days earlier.  Consider a
 followup chest x-ray in four weeks to document complete resolution.
