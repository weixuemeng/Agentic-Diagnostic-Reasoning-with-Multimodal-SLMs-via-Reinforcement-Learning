                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old female with new onset of atrial fibrillation.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size continues to be at the upper limits of normal with
 enlargement of the left atrium and right ventricle; these findings suggest
 both pulmonary hypertension and mitral stenosis.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable and within normal limits.  The lungs are clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mildly kyphotic appearance of the spine
 with minimal degenerative change.  It is unchanged from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlargement of the right ventricle suggest pulmonary hypertension
 while enlargement of the left atrium suggests mitral valve stenosis.
