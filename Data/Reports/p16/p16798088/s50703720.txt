                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mitral regurgitation and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued stable
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively normal pulmonary
 vessels.  This raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or even pericardial
 effusion, though there are no radiographic signs to support the latter
 diagnosis.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
