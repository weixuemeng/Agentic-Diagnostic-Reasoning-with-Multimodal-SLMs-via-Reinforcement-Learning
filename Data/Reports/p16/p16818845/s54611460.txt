                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Pulmonary sarcoidosis, asymptomatic, re-assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Substantial dextroscoliosis is re-demonstrated with associated tortuosity of
 the aorta.  Heart size is top normal, stable.  Overall, there are preserved
 lung volumes.  Nodular opacities in the left mid and lower lobe and to lesser
 extent in the right lung appear to be slightly more prominent than on the
 prior study.  Although it might potentially represent sarcoidosis that has
 developed in the interim, additional etiologies cannot be excluded. 
 Comparison with more recent prior studies is recommended.  Otherwise, chest CT
 would be appropriate next step.
