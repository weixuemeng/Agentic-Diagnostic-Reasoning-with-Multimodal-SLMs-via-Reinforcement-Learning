                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with stroke.  Study requested to rule
 out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate. There is a vague
 suggestion of a linear opacity at the left lower lung which could possibly
 represent pneumonia. Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague suggestion of a linear opacity at the left lower lung
 which, in the proper clinical scenario, could possibly represent pneumonia.
