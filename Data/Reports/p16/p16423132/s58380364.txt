                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx of brain aneurysms, acute slurred speech  //
 CT: eval for ICHCXR: eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Possible hyperinflation and flattened diaphragms, which could reflect presence
 of COPD.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone redistribution, without other
 evidence of CHF.
 
 No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  No focal opacities to suggest
 aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodule is detected.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Incidental note is made of shallow concavities with sclerotic borders seen
 along the inferior edge of the medial clavicles, right greater the left,
 representing normal variant rhomboid fossae.
 
 Incidental note made of ossification of the apparent opacification of the
 right renal collecting system likely related to CT angiogram obtained
 immediately prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.  No evidence of pneumonic infiltrate or
 aspiration pneumonitis.  No radiographic evidence of malignancy.
 
 Possible hyperinflation, suggestive of background COPD.
