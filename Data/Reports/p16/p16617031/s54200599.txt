                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  History of chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 aorta is also mildly tortuous.  Moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is noted with patchy opacities in the right middle lobe, most suggestive of
 associated atelectasis.  A possible nodular focus projects over the left mid
 lung measuring about 5 mm.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Fissures are mildly thickened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload.  
 
 2.  Basilar opacity suggesting probable atelectasis.  
 
 3.  Nodular focus projecting over the left mid lung, possibly a summation
 artifact.  However, in short-term follow-up, standard PA and lateral
 radiographs are recommended in order to reassess.
 
 Recommendation for follow-up xrays discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ by telephone.
