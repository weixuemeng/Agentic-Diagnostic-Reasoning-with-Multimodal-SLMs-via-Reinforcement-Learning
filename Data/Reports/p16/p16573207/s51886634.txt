                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers and pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known left basal
 pneumonia is slightly more extensive than on the previous image.  The lateral
 radiograph documents that the pneumonia extends in the entire left lower lobe,
 with exception of the apical segment.  Multiple air bronchograms are seen.  No
 safe evidence of a reactive pleural effusion.
 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
