                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Question aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 4 cm from the carina. 
 NG tube seen with tip in the gastric body, side port past the GE junction. 
 Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam and there is secondary
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  More confluent bibasilar opacities
 are seen projecting in the retrocardiac region.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET and NG tubes as above.  Bibasilar opacities, potentially due
 to atelectasis; however, aspiration or infiltrate are also possible.
