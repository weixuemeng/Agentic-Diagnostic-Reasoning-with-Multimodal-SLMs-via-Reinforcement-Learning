 due to large body habitus and low lung volumes. There is mild hilar
 engorgement and possible mild pulmonary edema. No convincing signs of
 pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. The
 mediastinal contour appears somewhat prominent likely due to position and AP
 technique. Otherwise no change
