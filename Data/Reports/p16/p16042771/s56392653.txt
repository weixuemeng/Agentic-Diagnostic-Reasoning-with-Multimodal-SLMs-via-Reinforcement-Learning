  1.  Enlarged right hilum which may reflect lymphadenopathy vs. prominent
  enlarged pulmonary artery.  This can be assessed non urgently by chest CT. 
  Alternatively, prior imaging would be helpful to document stability.
  
  2.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of acute intrathoracic process.

 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and
 hypertension, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is prominence to the right perihilar region which may reflect prominent
 vasculature or lymphadenopathy.  The lungs and pleural spaces are essentially
 clear without evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The heart is
 enlarged.  There is a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Aortic arch calcifications are
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Mild degenerative changes
 are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
