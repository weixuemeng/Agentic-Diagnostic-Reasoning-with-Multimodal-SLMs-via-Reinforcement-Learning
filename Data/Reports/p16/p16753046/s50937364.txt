 decreased.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is stable.  There is a 2
 x 4 cm lobulated opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view.  This appears to correlate with a left paraspinal contour on the
 frontal view.  This was definitely not present in ___, the last time that a
 true lateral radiograph was obtained.  Further imaging evaluation with CT
 should be considered.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Questioned lobulated opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine may

 evaluation.
