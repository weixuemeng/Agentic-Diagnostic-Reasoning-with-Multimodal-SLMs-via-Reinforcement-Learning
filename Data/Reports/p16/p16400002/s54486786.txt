                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP semi-erect portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with fall yesterday, tenderness in
 neck and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Prominent costochondral calcifications are seen.  There is slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, though
 a trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is likely left base atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to
 overlying soft tissue though trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
