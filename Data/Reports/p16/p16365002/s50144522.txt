                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left sided weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the
 left upper lobe, overlying the left fifth posterior rib, may be within the
 osseous structures or reflect a pulmonary nodule.  Lungs are otherwise clear
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  4 mm nodular opacity projecting over
 the left upper lobe may be within the bone or within the lung parenchyma. 
 Consider shallow oblique imaging or comparison with prior radiographs for
 further assessment.
