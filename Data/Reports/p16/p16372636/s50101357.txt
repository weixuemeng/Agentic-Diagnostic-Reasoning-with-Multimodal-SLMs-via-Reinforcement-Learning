                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall, no blood thinners, left hip
 fracture.  Please see the entire femur and for traumatic injuries.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Lower lobe bronchiectasis is noted.  The heart is normal in size.  There are
 surgical clips projecting over the right breast.
 
 No displaced rib fractures are noted.  Although no acute fracture or other
 chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient
 for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the
 demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the
 location of any referable focal findings  should be clearly marked and imaged
 with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
