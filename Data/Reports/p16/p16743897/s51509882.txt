                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, a right
 pleural effusion has nearly resolved, with no visible pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 present, improved on the right but worse on the left compared to the prior
 study.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is also slightly increased in
 size.
