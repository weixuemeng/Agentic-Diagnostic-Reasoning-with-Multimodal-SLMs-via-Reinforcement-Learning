                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with gastric cancer, pneumonia, and worsening
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-sized right pleural effusion and trace left pleural
 effusion appear similar compared to prior.  Consolidation at the right base
 likely represents compressive atelectasis, but underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath appears similarly positioned.  Pigtail catheter projects over the
 right upper quadrant.  Additional hardware projecting over the left upper
 quadrant appears similar on this view.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate right and trace left pleural effusions, with
 underlying right lower lung consolidation, which could represent atelectasis
 or pneumonia.
