                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip remains low lying, terminating approximately 2.4 cm
 from the carina.  An enteric tube remains in unchanged position.  Left sided
 chest tube remains with associated subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral
 chest wall, with previously noted kinking of the distal aspect of the tube now
 resolved.  Known small left pneumothorax appears grossly unchanged.  Aeration
 of the left lung base also appears slightly improved reflecting day
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Multiple left-sided rib
 fractures are again noted.  Remainder of the examination is otherwise
 unchanged.  There is no rightward shift of mediastinal structures.
