 INDICATION:  NEW dobhoff placement. ___ year old woman with multiple rib fx,
 polytrauma from ___.  // Dobhoff placement.  Check plcmt.  New dobhoff.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube is seen in the mid stomach with the stylet pulled back 3.0 cm
 from the armored tip. The ET tube is in standard position.  Right PICC
 terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged from prior.  Left chest tube is at the
 apex.
 
 The heart size is accentuated by lordotic view, though unlikely enlarged
 compared to prior.  The pulmonary vessels are mildly engorged without evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
 
 There are rounded opacities in the right lung partially overlying the anterior
 ribs, which may represent pneumonia or healing rib fractures.  Left upper lung
 appears improved in aeration compared to prior.  Again seen is small left
 apical pneumothorax smaller and extra pleural or loculated pleural hematoma in
 the left upper chest, unchanged from prior. No significant pleural effusion is
 seen.
 
 Multiple left rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube in the mid stomach with the stylet pulled back 3 cm from the
 armored tip.
 2. Multiple rounded opacities in the right lung, may be pneumonia or healing
 rib fractures.  Repeat radiograph with minimal objects overlying the patient
 is recommended.
