                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and pre-syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  The lung volumes are low and the right hemidiaphragm is moderately
 elevated compared to the left.  This appears substantial and may be due to an
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, enlarged liver or phrenic nerve
 paralysis.  The lungs appear clear aside from streaky right basilar opacity
 associated with the elevated hemidiaphragm on the right.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.
