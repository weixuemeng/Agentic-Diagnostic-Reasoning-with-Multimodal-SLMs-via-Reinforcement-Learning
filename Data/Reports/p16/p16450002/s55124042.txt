                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypertension, HLD, now with
 shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement.  The
 configuration indicates a prominence of the left ventricular contour to the
 left and posteriorly.  Left atrial enlargement mild.  The thoracic aorta is of
 ordinary dimension but mildly elongated.  No local contour abnormalities
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  There is moderate degree of demineralization of the
 vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine with moderate accentuation of the
 kyphotic curvature and mild degree of degenerative changes, but no evidence of
 vertebral body compression fracture exists.  Similar degree of degenerative
 changes existed already on the preceding examination of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement, left ventricular prominence
 compatible with clinical diagnosis of hypertension.  There is no evidence of
 acute pulmonary vascular congestion or acute infiltrates.  Stable degenerative
 changes in thoracic spine.
