                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough SOB and possible LLL opacity on
 portable plain film evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and outside hospital
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior chest radiograph, pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild pulmonary edema have improved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is crowding of the infrahilar vessels, compatible with
 atelectasis, improved compared with a ___.  A left hemidiaphragm is
 not distinctly visible.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle is
 consistent with a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening.  There is
 no gross pleural effusion and no pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. 
 Background COPD again noted.  The cardiomediastinal contour is stable
 including cardiomegaly and mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries
 suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Biapical pleural-parenchymal
 scarring is similar to the recent prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary
 edema.
 2. Small residual pleural fluid and/or thickening and left infrahilar
 atelectasis again noted.
 3. Hyperexpansion suggesting COPD.
 4. No focal consolidation
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:50 AM, 1 minutes after
