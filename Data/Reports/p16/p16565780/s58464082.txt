                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dysphagia, increased cough and dyspnea. 
 Evaluate for consolidation.  // evaluate for consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous ___ in chest x-ray exam atropine for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 is increased retrocardiac opacity.  While this could represent atelectasis,
 the differential diagnosis includes infection or aspiration.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right base is also present.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. COPD and cardiomegaly.
 2. Mild vascular plethora consistent with mild CHF.
 3. Patchy opacity left base consistent with atelectasis, the differential
 diagnosis includes infectious infiltrate or changes due to aspiration.
