                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // eval for ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right hemithorax postsurgical changes are again noted with volume loss likely
 related to prior resection. Please correlate clinically. There is loculated
 pleural fluid fluid at the right apex and right lung base, moderate in overall
 volume. The cardiac size is moderately enlarged. There is no focal pulmonary
 consolidation or pneumothorax. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Postsurgical changes in the right hemi thorax likely reflect prior
 resection with a moderate loculated right pleural effusion. Please correlate
 with prior imaging studies and clinical history.
 3. Cardiomegaly.
