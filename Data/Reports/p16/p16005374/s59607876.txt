                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever and tachypnea, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low.  There is a retrocardiac streaky opacity which could represent a
 left lower lobe pneumonia.  Crowding of bronchovasculature likely accounts for
 the subtle opacity adjacent to the right heart border.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear
 stable and normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity which could represent left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
