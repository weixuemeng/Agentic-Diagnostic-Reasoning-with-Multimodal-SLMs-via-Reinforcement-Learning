 INDICATION:  Patient with cough since ___ days involves the right chest and
 sinus syndrome, rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimal linear opacities at costodiaphragmatic angle are probably atelectasis
 rather than infection.  The lungs are hyperinflated related to MPOC. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Small linear opacities at costodiaphragmatic angle are probably atelectasis. 
 Beginning of pneumonia cannot be totally excluded in appropriate clinical
 settings.  
 
 The results have been posted to the radiology dashboard for direct
