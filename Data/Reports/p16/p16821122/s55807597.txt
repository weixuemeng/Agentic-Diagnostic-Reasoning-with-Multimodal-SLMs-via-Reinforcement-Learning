                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited by motion artifact and low lung volumes. 
 Allowing for these limitation, there are no focal parenchymal opacities. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with the exception of a
 tortuous aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes; otherwise, unremarkable chest radiographic
 examination.
