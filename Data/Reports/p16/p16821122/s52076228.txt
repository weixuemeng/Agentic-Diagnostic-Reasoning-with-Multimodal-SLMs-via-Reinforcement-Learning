                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, evaluate for pneumothorax,
 effusion, consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable allowing for differences due to a
 suboptimal inspiratory effort.  There is a tortuous thoracic aorta, as on
 prior exam.  The hila are within normal limits.  There is evidence of prior
 right rotator cuff repair.  Slightly increased opacity projecting over the
 right mid lung on AP view likely represents crowding of normal structures. 
 Otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle right lower lobe opacity likely represents crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 pneumothorax or effusion.
