                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic chylothorax, status post
 chest tube and PleurX, status post clamping of tube, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding studies obtained
 2 and 6 hours earlier.  Marked cardiac enlargement as before.  Position of
 right-sided chest tube as well as smaller draining catheter unchanged. 
 Unaltered position of previously described left-sided PICC line terminating in
 lower SVC and probably approaching right atrium.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  As before, markedly congested vascular pattern in lungs and
 evidence of bilateral pleural effusion.  The congestive vascular pattern
 persists and may even have increased further.  Size quantitation of this
 process on single chest view has limitations.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent pulmonary congestion and increased pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax.
