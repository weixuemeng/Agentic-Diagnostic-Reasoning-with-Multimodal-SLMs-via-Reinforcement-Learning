                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chylothorax, status post
 lymphangiogram, still with oxygen requirement, evaluate for interval change of
 effusion or contrast in the lungs.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The moderately enlarged heart appears unchanged.  Thoracic aorta as
 before with marked extensive wall calcifications.  The previously observed
 right-sided pleural effusion that blunts the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinus has again increased and reaches now to the mid portion of the
 right-sided lateral chest wall.  On the lateral wall, the increased densities
 are located most posteriorly and have also increased when comparison is made
 between the lateral views.  No new acute pulmonary infiltrates can be
 identified and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 The patient has undergone a lymphangiogram on the preceding day, which showed
 some filling of lymphatic channels from the left leg up to the retroperitoneal
 structures and periaortic location.  At no point was communication with the
 thoracic duct established.  Thus, it is not surprising that any pulmonary
 arterial embolization with contrast particles cannot be identified on the
 plain chest examination.  It is possible, however, that lymphangiographic
 material has entered in the right lower pleural and pulmonary parenchymal
 territory as the CT examination of ___ suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild progression of pleural density on the right base, no
 conclusive evidence of contrast embolization.
