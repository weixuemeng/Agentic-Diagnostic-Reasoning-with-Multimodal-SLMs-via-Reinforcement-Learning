                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chronic chylothorax status post pleurodesis.  Assess tube
 removal.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is obscured by the pleuro- parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side are unchanged.  A rounded
 opacity projects in the right lower pneumothorax is likely fluid in the
 tissue.  There is persistent collapse of the right lower lobe.  Increased
 radiolucency in the right lower hemithorax suggests the presence of
 pneumothorax but no pleural line can be clearly identified.  A close followup
 is recommended.  
 
 The aorta is densely calcified.  Left PICC tip remains in the right atrium and
 right pleural catheter at the base remains in place.  The largest chest tube
 has been removed.
