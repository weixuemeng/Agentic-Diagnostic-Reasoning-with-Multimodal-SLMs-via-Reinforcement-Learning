                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:33 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chronic chylothorax, now has a Pleurx
 catheter, after pleurodesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small volume of pleural fluid at the base of the right hemithorax has
 increased, pneumothorax of equivalent size is probably still present.  There
 may also be an increase in small right fissural pleural collection.  Moderate
 left pleural effusion and severe left lower lobe atelectasis are stable. 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  A left-sided catheter, presumably a PIC line,
 ends low in the right atrium.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but not
 clearly dilated.
