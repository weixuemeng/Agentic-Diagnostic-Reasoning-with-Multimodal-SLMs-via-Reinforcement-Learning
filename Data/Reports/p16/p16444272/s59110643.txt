 Small right pleural effusion has decreased substantially since ___.  There

 congestion is also longstanding, but there is no pulmonary edema.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified from the root to the

 seen in the right innominate and both subclavian and axillary arteries.
