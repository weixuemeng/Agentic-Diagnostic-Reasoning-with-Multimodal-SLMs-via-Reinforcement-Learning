                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chylothorax and
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is noted, most likely slightly increased since the prior study,
 thus potentially pericardial effusion is a possibility.  There is also
 interval increase in right pleural effusion, moderate, with small amount of
 left pleural effusion which appears to be new and associated with bibasal
 consolidations.  Extensive calcifications within the vessels were
 demonstrated.
