 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of left-sided effusion, evaluation of interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided pleural

 comparable to a previous radiograph from ___.  The effusion
 occupies about one-fourth of the right hemithorax and creates a relatively
 extensive right basal atelectasis.
 
 No other relevant changes.  Moderate cardiomegaly, scars in the lung
 parenchyma, notably in the region of the right lung apex.  Moderate tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  No current evidence of acute lung changes.
