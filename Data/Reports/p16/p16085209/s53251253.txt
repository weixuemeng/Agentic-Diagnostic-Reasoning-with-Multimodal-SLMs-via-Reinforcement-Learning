                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax status post chest tube removal in a
 patient with thymectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  Lung volumes are minimally improved, however, persistent linear
 opacities in the left upper and lower lung represent atelectasis.  The
 previously noted right-sided chest tube has been removed and there is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Normal cardiac and mediastinal contours.
 Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Mildly improved but persistent low lung volumes.
