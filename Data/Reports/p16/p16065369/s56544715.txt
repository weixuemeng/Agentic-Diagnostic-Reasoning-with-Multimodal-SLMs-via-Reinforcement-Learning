                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PPM on left today, now with chest pain.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared with prior film, a left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips
 over right atrium and right ventricle.  An additional electronic device
 overlies the cardiac silhouette -- ? outside of the patient.  
 
 The patient is slightly rotated.  Allowing for that, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, with borderline cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No focal consolidation or gross effusion. 
 Possible tiny effusion at the left and right costophrenic angle.  No
 pneumothorax detected.  No pneumomediastinum.No free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Status post placement of left pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Additional electronic device noted. 
 2) Equivocal minimal bilateral effusions without other evidence of acute
 pulmonary process.  
 3) No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
