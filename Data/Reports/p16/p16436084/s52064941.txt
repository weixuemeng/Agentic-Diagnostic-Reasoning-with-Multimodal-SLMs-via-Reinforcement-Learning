                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including a convex contour to
 the right upper mediastinal contour, which is stable and most often associated
 with tortuosity of the great vessels.  There is a new moderate interstitial
 abnormality most suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema.  The central
 airways are cuffed.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on each side. 
 Degenerative changes and suspected bony demineralization along the thoracic
 spine are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate interstitial abnormality which suggests pulmonary
 edema.  If clinical findings are discordant, however, then the possibility of
 atypical infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting,
 although less likely.
