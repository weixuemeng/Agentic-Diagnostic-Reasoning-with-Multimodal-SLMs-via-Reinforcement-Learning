 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low, though there is mild increase in overall conspicuity of the pulmonary
 interstitial markings which raises concern for mild interstitial edema.  No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Clips in the right upper
 quadrant noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for mild pulmonary edema.
