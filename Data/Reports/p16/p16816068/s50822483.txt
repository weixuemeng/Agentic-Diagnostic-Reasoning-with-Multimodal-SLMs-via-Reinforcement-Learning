                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Question of right clavicle fracture with obvious deformity,
 assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 peripheral reticular opacities throughout the lungs, which appear most
 compatible with interstitial lung disease.  Heart size is normal.  Somewhat
 prominent appearance of the mediastinum could reflect vascular ectasia.  The
 right clavicular neck deformity is better assessed in the subsequent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with interstitial lung disease.  Right
 clavicular neck deformity is better assessed in the subsequent CT.  Please
 refer to report from that study for additional details.
