                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are noted.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  Widening of the right superior mediastinal contour is unchanged, and
 likely reflects tortuous vessels.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the thoracic aorta are present.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures due to low inspiratory lung volumes.  No pulmonary edema, focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Low lung volumes.
