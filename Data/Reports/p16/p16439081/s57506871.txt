 reflect a component of atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. The
 heart is enlarged, unchanged since prior examination. Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are seen.

 Enlarged heart with hazy parahilar densities reflective of early congestive
 heart failure.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
