                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increased leg swelling and erythema.  Recent exacerbation of
 congestive heart failure, although not short of breath at present.  On
 treatment for COPD exacerbation.  History also notable for atrial
 fibrillation, diabetes, lung cancer, and diastolic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is again mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  Postoperative
 changes with volume loss, relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and
 thickening of the pleural surfaces, potentially with pleural effusion, appear
 unchanged in the left hemithorax.  Surgical clips also project along the left
 mid chest.  Wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body anteriorly appears
 unchanged.  Moderate degenerative changes are similar throughout the thoracic
 spine more generally, and bony demineralization is suspected.  There is also
 mild rightward convex curvature of the thoracic spine, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
