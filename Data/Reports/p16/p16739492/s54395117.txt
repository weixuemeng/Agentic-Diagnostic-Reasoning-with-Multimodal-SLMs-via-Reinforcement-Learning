                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer, now with bilateral lower extremity swelling,
 question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a left
 arm PICC line with tip residing in the expected location of the superior vena
 cava.  Clips are noted projecting over the left chest.  A left pleural
 effusion is again noted with left basilar consolidation, possibly representing
 atelectasis and essentially unchanged from prior exam.  Right lung remains
 clear.  There is mild cephalization, which is compatible with mild congestive
 heart failure.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures appear
 unremarkable and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left basilar effusion/consolidation.  Mild
 cephalization, likely indicating mild degree of failure.  PICC line
 appropriately positioned.
