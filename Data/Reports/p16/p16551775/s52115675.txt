                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Amiodarone, routine surveillance.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Normal lung volumes.  Mild bilateral apical scarring.  Normal size of
 the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pathologic
 findings in the lung parenchyma, notably no evidence of fibrotic lung
 parenchymal changes.  A faint 2 mm rounded opacity, projecting over the lower
 aspect of the fourth right rib and internally to the upper border of the
 second right rib is seen on the frontal radiograph only and likely reflects
 structure on the skin.
