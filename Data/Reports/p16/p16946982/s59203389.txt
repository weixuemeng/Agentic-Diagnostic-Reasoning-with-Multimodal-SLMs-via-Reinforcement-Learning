                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided infusion port is seen, with the tip terminating in the lower
 SVC.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.   In comparison to the prior
 examination, there has been increase in right pleural effusion/atelectasis. 
 Possible trace left pleural effusion is present as well.  No definite focal
 consolidation is identified. The central pulmonary vasculature is slightly
 prominent.  No overt CHF.  Hazy density overlying the lower left chest is
 similar to the prior exam and may reflect the presence of the breast shadow.
 
 There is a severe thoracic vertebral body compression deformity (question T7),
 unchanged since prior examination.  There is mild associated focal kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater left, with atelectasis at the right
 base, significantly more pronounced than on ___.  Possibility of an
 early pneumonic infiltrate at the right base cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Severe compression deformity (vertebra plana) of mid thoracic vertebral body,
 unchanged compared with recent prior chest x-ray from ___.  Clinical
 correlation is requested.
