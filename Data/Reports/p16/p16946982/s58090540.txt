                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma and fevers.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes within normal limits.  Asymmetric breast
 shadows.  On the lateral view, there is slight blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle, which may be atelectasis or trace pleural effusion. 
 However, there is not a gross consolidative process.  Slightly heterogeneous
 appearance of osseous structures may relate to the stated history of multiple
 myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No gross consolidation.  However, there is some posterior costophrenic
 blunting which may represent atelectasis.  The possibility of an infectious
 process cannot be excluded.
