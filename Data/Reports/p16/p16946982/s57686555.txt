 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma  // pre bmt eval      pre
 bmt eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is less opacification at the
 right base, consistent with decreasing pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Somewhat unusual appearance to at least 1 rib in that region raises the
 possibility of myelomatous involvement.
 Severe loss of height is again seen in the mid dorsal vertebral body, as well
 as what appears to be an upper lumbar vertebral body.
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Apical pleural
 thickening is again seen.  The Port-A-Cath tip remains in the mid portion of
 the SVC.
