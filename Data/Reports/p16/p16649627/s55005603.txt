                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with chest and back pain, elevated
 blood pressure, evaluate for mediastinal widening, fluid overload, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate linear
 atelectasis in the left lower lung.  The heart size is moderately enlarged,
 the aortic contour is prominent.  There is an indistinct quality to the
 pulmonary vasculature.  No focal consolidation is seen, there are no pleural
 effusions nor pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with moderate cardiac
 enlargement.  The aortic contour is prominent, which may be the result of
 tortuosity, however enlargement is not excluded on this study.
