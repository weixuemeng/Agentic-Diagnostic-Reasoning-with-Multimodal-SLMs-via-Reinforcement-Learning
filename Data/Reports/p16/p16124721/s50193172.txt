                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old status post motor vehicle accident with pneumothorax. 
 Evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP supine radiograph shows marked increase in the patient's
 right-sided pneumothorax, which was previously a sliver of air seen on CT and
 now encompasses approximately ___% of the volume of the apex.  This is
 associated with a wedge of consolidated lung adjacent to the hilum, which,
 while suggestive of consolidated right upper lobe, must only be a portion of
 the lobe as the minor fissure between the middle lobe and upper lobe as well
 as an accessory fissure are still visible.  These changes are associated with
 very slight leftward mediastinal shift.  Known first rib fracture on the right
 is not visible on this plain film.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube
 are in unchanged position.  Increased clarity of the right base and left lung
 appear to be related to better lung volumes.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Significant increase in right-sided pneumothorax is associated
 with consolidated segment of likely a portion of the right upper lobe adjacent
 to the hilum.  A close clinical observation with or without followup
 computerized tomography of the chest is recommended to follow any developing
 lung torsion on a pedicle.  Findings called to TSICU residnet at time of
 dictation, which is 3:30 on ___.
