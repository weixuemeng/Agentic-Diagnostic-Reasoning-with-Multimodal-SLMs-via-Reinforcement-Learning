                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old trauma patient with pneumothorax status post pigtail
 catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP portable chest radiograph shows a new right-sided thoracic
 catheter at the right lung base and reexpansion of previously consolidated
 perihilar right upper lobe segements.  A small right-sided pneumothorax
 remains.  In addition, there is now a small left apical pneumothorax which was
 not seen on the study from less than two hours earlier.  The endotracheal tube
 is almost 6 cm above the carina and nasogastric tube sidehole is now at the
 level of the g-e junction and should be advanced.  Leftward mediastinal shift
 is now corrected.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Residual right apical pneumothorax with partial reexpansion of collapsed
 right upper lobe segment in a patient status post right chest tube placement. 
 Note made of new left apical pneumothorax.  Pulmonary findings called to
 trauma SICU at time of dictation, which is 5:00 p.m. on ___.
