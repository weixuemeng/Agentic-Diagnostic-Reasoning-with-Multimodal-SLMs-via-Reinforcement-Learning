                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with no visible
 pneumothorax.  Previously reported left lower lobe opacity has nearly
 resolved.  Such rapid improvement favors aspiration as a likely etiology. 
 Small left pleural effusion is noted.
