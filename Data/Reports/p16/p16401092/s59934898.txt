                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube has been removed.  Right internal jugular
 and left-sided PICC lines appear unchanged, both terminating in the superior
 vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Patchy basilar opacities are unchanged and are most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no definite pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.  Low
 lung volumes and persistent basilar opacities, which could be seen with
 atelectasis, although infectious process is not excluded by this study.
