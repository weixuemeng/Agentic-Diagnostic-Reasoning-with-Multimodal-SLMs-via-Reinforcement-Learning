                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior from
 ___.  Compared to prior, there has been near complete resolution of left
 base opacity which is still faintly visualized.  In addition, there is new
 ill-defined parenchymal opacity in the right mid lung which is new. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Surgical clips are again seen in the
 upper abdomen.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial resolution of left base parenchymal opacity with new
 patchy opacity in the right mid lung compatible with additional focus of
 infection.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
