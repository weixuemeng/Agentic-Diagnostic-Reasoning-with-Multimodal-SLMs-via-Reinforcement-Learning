 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 06:40 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged most likely reflecting cardiomegaly. There are
 multiple calcifications in the right upper lobe suggestive of prior
 granulomatous infection.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The right hilum
 appears slightly prominent, but this is felt to most likely be related to
 patient rotation on the current study rather than lymphadenopathy.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis or
 scarring.  No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.  No large effusions.
