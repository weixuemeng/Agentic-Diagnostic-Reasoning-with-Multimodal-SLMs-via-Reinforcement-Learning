                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately five hours prior to this
 exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are patchy opacities in the
 left lower lung region as well as in the right lower lung, more prominently in
 the right cardiophrenic angle which appear new or more conspicuous than on the
 previous examination.  No other focal opacities are identified.  Bilateral
 apical pleural parenchymal scarring is present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Significant atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aortic knob are present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of patchy bibasilar opacities is compatible
 with multifocal pneumonia.  The increased conspicuity in the short interval is
 likely related to full manifestation of the inflammatory process after
 administration of IV fluids.
