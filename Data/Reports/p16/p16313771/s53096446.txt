                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 without appreciable vascular congestion in a patient with intact midline
 sternal wires and evidence of previous CABG procedure.  This discordance
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
 
 No evidence of pleural fluid or definite acute pneumonia.
