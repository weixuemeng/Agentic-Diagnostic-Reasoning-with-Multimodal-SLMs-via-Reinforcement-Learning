 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A 7-8 mm
 nodular opacity projecting over the lingula, which is most likely calcified,
 possibly representing calcified granuloma, however, this can be confirmed on
 chest CT.  On the lateral view, there is suggestion of possible calcified
 mediastinal lymph nodes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  7-8 mm lingular nodular opacity which is most likely calcified
 and may represent a calcified granuloma; however, suggest confirmation with
 chest CT.  No focal consolidation.
