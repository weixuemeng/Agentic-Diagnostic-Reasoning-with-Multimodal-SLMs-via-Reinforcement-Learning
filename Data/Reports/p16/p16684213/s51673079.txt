 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxia after colonoscopy/EGD  //
 evaluate for pulm edema vs aspiration      evaluate for pulm edema vs
 aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heterogeneous areas of peribronchial opacification
 have all coalesced in the left upper and right lower lung zones.  This could
 be atelectasis in the areas of previous pulmonary edema or local infection,
 perhaps due to aspiration.  Heart is normal size but larger today than it was
 on ___.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Feeding tube is been removed.
