 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Evaluation for infiltrate requested.
 
 COMPARISONS: Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate unfolding and calcification along the thoracic aorta. 
 There is a left posterior focal opacity concerning for pneumonia.  Mild
 interstitial disease is suspected in the periphery of the lower lungs.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Each
 acromiohumeral interval is again effaced, suggestive of rotator cuff
 pathology.  There is also moderate rightward convex curvature centered along
 the mid-to-lower thoracic spine, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left lower lobe, worrisome for pneumonia.  Since
 no remote comparison studies are available, however, differential
 considerations include more chronic atelectasis or scarring.  Comparison to
 prior films may be helpful, if available.
