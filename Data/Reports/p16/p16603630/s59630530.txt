                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A
 relatively dense nodule projects over the left upper lobe. This corresponds to
 a known nodule seen on previous chest CT without evidence for change (small
 changes would be difficult to detect with radiography, however). There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease. Nodule in the left upper lobe.
