                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers and elevated white count.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Minimal hazy opacities at the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, and there are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Minimal
 hazy opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
