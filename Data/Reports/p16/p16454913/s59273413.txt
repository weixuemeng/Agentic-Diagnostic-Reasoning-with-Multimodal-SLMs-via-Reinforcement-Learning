                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, immunosuppressed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest is obtained.  Midline
 tracheostomy is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly
 stable.  There has been interval decrease in previously seen bilateral
 opacities with possible mild left base atelectasis/residua.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left-sided PICC is seen,
 distal tip not well seen but likely in the region of the low SVC/cavoatrial
 junction.  What appears to be dense contrast is seen projecting over the
 gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in bilateral pulmonary opacities with possible
 mild residua in the lateral left lung base and possibly in the right upper
 lobe.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.
