                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, as well as earlier radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiac enlargement appears similar.  Prominent
 mediastinal contours are also unchanged.  Background prominence of the
 pulmonary vascularity is also quite similar to the prior study.  There is
 probably minimal right basilar atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
