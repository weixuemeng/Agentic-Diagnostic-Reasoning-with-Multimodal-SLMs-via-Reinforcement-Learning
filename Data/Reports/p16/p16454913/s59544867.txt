                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheoplasty, now labored breathing and wheezing. 
 Question new infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:11 a.m., the overall appearance is quite similar. 
 Possible minimal improvement in the extensive opacities.  There is marked
 cardiomegaly, without significant change.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. 
 There is probably also an element of pulmonary edema.  There are small to
 moderate right-greater-than-left effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Tracheostomy tube again noted.  A Dobbhoff-type tube is
 present, with its radiopaque tip incompletely imaged,but overlying the gastric
 fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 2.  CHF with probable pulmonary edema.
 3.  Bilateral effusions, left-greater-than-right, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 4.  Findings are compatible with pulmonary edema, but the possibility of an
 associated infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.  
 5.  Minimal, if any, interval improvement compared with one day earlier.
