                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with trach trial collar, chest x-ray after trial.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays, the last one done ___ and
 chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy is in adequate position and a left dialysis catheter ends at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Moderate pulmonary edema has increased since prior exam
 and a right amount of moderate loculated pleural effusion is unchanged as
 shown on the CT of ___.  The mediastinal and cardiac contour
 are moderately enlarged.  Left lower lobe consolidation has increased compared
 to ___, but unchanged since ___.  This could be
 compatible with atelectasis; however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  NG tube is in the stomach.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema has increased.
 3.  Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened since ___, but
 this is unchanged since ___.  This could be due to recurrent
 atelectasis due to mucus plugging; however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
