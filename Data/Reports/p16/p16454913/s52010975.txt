                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling tracheostomy tube and vascular catheter are unchanged in
 position.  Interval decrease in extent of cardiomediastinal widening, as well
 as improving pulmonary edema which is now asymmetrical, involving the right
 lung to a greater degree than the left.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Right-sided circumferential pleural opacity appears similar and
 may reflect the combination of pleural fluid and pleural thickening. 
 Persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities, which may reflect atelectasis,
 dependent edema or infectious consolidation.
