                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, on BiPAP. Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. Bilateral
 opacities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac opacity
 may be secondary to atelectasis/edema, but a superimposed infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, with mild pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac opacity may be
 due to a combination of atelectasis and edema, but superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
