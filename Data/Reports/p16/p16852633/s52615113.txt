                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, evaluate pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film,the PICC line has been removed.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is background COPD, with hyperinflation, and elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  Also again seen is cardiomegaly with enlargement of the left
 ventricle and slight tortuosity of the aorta.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No focal infiltrate, consolidation, or
 effusion is identified.  Punctate densities seen at the right base appear to
 represent vessel seen on end.
 
 Mild degenerative changes and slight wedging of several vertebral bodies in
 the mid thoracic spine with associated accentuated kyphosis noted.  These
 likely represents  chronic findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion detected.
