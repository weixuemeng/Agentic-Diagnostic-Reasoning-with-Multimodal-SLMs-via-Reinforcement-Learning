                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute cholangitis.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Aside from minimal
 atelectasis in the left base, the lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  In the lateral view, blunting of the posterior CP angles
 suggest the presence of small pleural effusion.
