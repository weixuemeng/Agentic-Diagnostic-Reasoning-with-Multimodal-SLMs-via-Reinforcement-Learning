                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with abdominal pain, evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Port-A-Cath projects over the right chest with tip in the right atrium.  Lung
 volumes are extremely low.  A triangular density projecting over the left
 lower lung likely represents plate-like atelectasis.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density. Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation, large
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extremely low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Given this, left
 lower lobe consolidaiton cannot be excluded, but no other aras of
 consolidation are suggested.
 2.  No free air under the diaphragm.
