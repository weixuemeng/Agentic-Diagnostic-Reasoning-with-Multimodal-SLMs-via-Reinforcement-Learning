                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph
 ___ ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of COPD, PE, now with
 productive cough and wheezing, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating no
 focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  A prominent epicardial fat pad
 accounts for the mild silhouetting of the left and right heart borders.  A
 rounded calcification projecting over the medial right lung base corresponds
 with a peripherally calcified nodule in the medial right breast on prior CT. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and splaying of
 bronchovasculature compatible with underlying COPD.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without superimposed pneumonia.
