                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, WITH DECUBITUS.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD, new infiltrate and
 enlarging effusion, evaluate effusion.  Requires PA, lateral and decubitus
 films.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and remains
 within normal limits.  Similar as seen on preceding examination is a hazy
 density on the left base superimposed over the cardiac apical area, clouding
 slightly the left lateral pleural sinus.  There is, however, no evidence of
 any pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinus and the posterior pleural
 sinuses are seen to be clear on the lateral view.  Thus, this finding is
 compatible with an apical extra pericardial fat pad that appears unchanged in
 both frontal and lateral view on previous and present examination.  Review of
 an older chest examination of ___, demonstrated also unchanged
 and stable appearance of this finding.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  There exists a somewhat irregular peripheral vascular distribution
 in both lungs, suggestive but not conclusive for COPD.  Acute parenchymal
 infiltrates cannot be identified and there is no pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly within normal limits,
 however, on the lateral view, one can identify a mildly anterior wedge-shaped
 vertebral body in the lower thoracic spine, probably T11.  This finding
 existed; however, already on the preceding study.  Additional bilateral
 decubitus films were obtained as specifically requested by the referring
 physician.  There is no evidence of any pleural effusion layering in the
 lateral dependent pleural spaces on either side.
 
 The performance of decubitus films in this case was redundant as the lateral
 film excluded any pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior pleural
 sinuses with patient in upright position.  Referring physician, ___. ___
 ___ was contacted by ___.
