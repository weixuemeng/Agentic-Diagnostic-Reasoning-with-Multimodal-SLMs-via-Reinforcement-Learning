                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  An area of increased
 opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle raises the possibility of a
 developing consolidation, though this could be a manifestation of mild change
 in patient position.  Otherwise, little change and there is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
