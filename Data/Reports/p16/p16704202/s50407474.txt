                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications are less prominent.  Some of this may reflect the PA rather
 than AP frontal view.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with
 bilateral pleural effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases.
