                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal stenosis, question acute pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, though I doubt overt CHF.  The right hemidiaphragm
 is elevated.  In addition, there is some patchy opacity at the right base,
 raising the question of a focal infiltrate.  This is associated with pleural
 fluid and/or thickening.  A contralateral effusion is also likely present. 
 There is a ___.4 mm focal nodular opacity in the left mid zone, which appears
 new compared with ___ -- no corresponding finding is described on the
 ___ chest CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 3.  Patchy opacity right base of indeterminate chronicity.  The differential
 does include an infectious or inflammatory infiltrate.  Bilateral small
 effusions.
 
 4.  Nodular density in left mid zone without obvious correlate described on
 the ___ CT scan.  Attention to this area on followup radiographs is
 recommended.
