 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia  // assess for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased
 interstitial markings likely reflect low lung volumes rather than pulmonary
 edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with increased interstitial markings.  No frank pulmonary
 edema present.
