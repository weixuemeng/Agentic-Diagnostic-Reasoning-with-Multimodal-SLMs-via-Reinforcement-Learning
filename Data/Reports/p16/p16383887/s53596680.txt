                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST AND LEFT RIBS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain after motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral, and left ribs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aorta shows moderate tortuosity and the arch
 patchy calcification.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  The lungs appear clear. Moderate degenerative changes affect
 the mid through lower thoracic spine as well as both shoulders. Mild cortical
 irregularity along the course of the anterior lateral eighth rib suggests a
 non-displaced fracture.  Surgical clips are noted at the base of the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected non-displaced left eighth rib fracture.  No radiographic evidence of
 intrathoracic injury.
