                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Rapid atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, perhaps somewhat larger than before.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are new dense
 opacities involving both lower lobes, greater on the right than left, and
 there is probably also some degree of atelectasis or pneumonia seen on the
 lateral view anteriorly, probably referring to the right middle lobe.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature appears
 essentially within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
