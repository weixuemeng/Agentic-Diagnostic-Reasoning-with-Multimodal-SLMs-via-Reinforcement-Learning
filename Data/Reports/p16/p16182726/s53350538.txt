                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged with increased engorgement of the vessels compared to
 prior.  Bilateral lower lobe predominant confluent airspace opacities are
 again demonstrated, involving the right lower lobe to a greater degree than
 the left. This is similar on the right and minimally improved on the left.
 Additionally, numerous septal lines are present at the lung bases. . There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 Of note, although these lung findings have been present since ___,
 there are new compared to ___ chest radiograph
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent lower lung airspace process accompanied by basilar interstitial
 opacities. In a patient with a history of cardiac disease, this could reflect
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration
 and persistent or recurrent infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup
 radiograph should be obtained to assess for resolution following appropriate
 therapy. If findings persist and the diagnosis remains uncertain clinically,
 chest CT would be recommended for more complete characters.
