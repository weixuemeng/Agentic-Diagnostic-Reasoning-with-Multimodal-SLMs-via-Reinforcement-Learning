                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with asthma, now with fever and shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation of the lung bases.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.  Retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis,
 but a small focus of infection cannot be excluded.  Mild peribronchial cuffing
 and interstitial prominence is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis; retrocardiac opacity likely
 represents atelectasis, but a small focus of consolidation cannot be excluded.
 Peribronchial cuffing and interstitial prominence suggest small airways
 disease, which could be secondary to reactive airways and/or a viral process.
