                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain, to assess for rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 appears somewhat more prominent, though still probably within upper limits of
 normal in size.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease, though no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
