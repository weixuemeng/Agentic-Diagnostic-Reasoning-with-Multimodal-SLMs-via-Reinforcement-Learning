                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pleural effusion status post
 thoracentesis, assess for interval change.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted and compared to
 prior study of ___ at ___ and ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be a large pleural effusion surrounding the right lung
 with minimal change in size of the effusion and degree of lung aeration. 
 There is a small-to-moderate layering left effusion. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the extensive effusions
 and the technique of the examination.  No obvious pneumothorax, although the
 patient is only semi-erect on the study, which would lower the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax.
