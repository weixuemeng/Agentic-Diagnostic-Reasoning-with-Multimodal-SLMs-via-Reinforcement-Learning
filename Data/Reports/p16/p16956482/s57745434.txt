 AP CHEST, 10:59 A.M., ___

 acute nausea and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The mid portion of the right lung is consolidated, and the lower right
 hemithorax is uniformly opacified.  This could be due to various combinations
 of dense consolidation and pleural effusion, even considerable.  CT scanning
 would be required to assess the contribution perhaps the nature of pleural
 fluid.  If the patient can tolerate intravenous contrast administration, that
 would be helpful in assessing the configuration and inflammation of the
 pleural surfaces.  Heart is normal size.  Left lung and pleural space are
 normal.  Findings were discussed at length by telephone with Dr. ___ at
 12:30 p.m.
