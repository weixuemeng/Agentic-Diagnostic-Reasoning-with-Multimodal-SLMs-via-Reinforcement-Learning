                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:43
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent thoracentesis, question
 re-expansion pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 18:04.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 10:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is some increasing linear opacity at the right lung base suggestive of
 increasing atelectasis.  In addition, there is likely some reaccumulation of
 the right pleural effusion and there is a stable layering left effusion.  The
 retrocardiac consolidation is stable, also most likely representing
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes remain somewhat
 diminished.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
