 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:49 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier today, there is interval
  improvement of large right-sided pleural effusion.  Probable small amount of
  pleural effusion remains.  No definite pneumothorax identified in this
  portable film.  Small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver transplant with shortness of
 breath and large right effusion status post thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 4:27 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in the right pleural effusion with dramatic decrease
 in overall size and improved aeration throughout the right lung.  There is
 persistent opacity at the right base likely reflecting residual partial lower
 lobe atelectasis.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  There is a small
 layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac consolidation most likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Persistent relatively low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in positioning between studies.
