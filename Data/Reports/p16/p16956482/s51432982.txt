                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent liver transplant and complex hospital
 course involving pleural effusions and collapse.  The patient is clinically
 improved and feeling well, but there is no air movement at the lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lateral view shows a surprisingly large anterior component of
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, with persistent smaller posterior
 component.  Despite the appearance of prior chest radiographs, and their
 interpretations, there may not be right lower lobe collapse, although the
 position of the right hilus suggests some volume loss.  Left lung is clear and
 there is no left pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
