 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:35 PM
  The right upper lobe is less aerated compared to the prior study, but this is
  likely due to more supine positioning of the patient causing redistribution of
  the effusion.  There is no air-fluid level to suggest hydropneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT 19:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with an attempt at thoracentesis, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 Single portable upright chest film ___ at 19:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is a large right-sided pleural effusion which now surrounds the
 right lung which is diminished in aeration.  Although this may be better
 visualized on the current examination due to differences in positioning, with
 the history of multiple attempts at central line placement, superimposed acute
 hemorrhage into the pleural space should also be clinically considered.  There
 is no evidence of a hydropneumothorax, however.  There is also a small or
 moderate layering left effusion.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of the
 vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema.  Given the extent of the effusions,
 evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging. 
 Short-interval followup imaging may be helpful.
