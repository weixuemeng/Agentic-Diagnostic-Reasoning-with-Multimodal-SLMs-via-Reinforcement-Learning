                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with CAD, previous MI, CHF, hypertension
 presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath, evaluate for CHF
 exacerbation or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Allowing for differences in
 technique and lung volumes, cardiomediastinal silhouette including
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Lung volumes have slightly increased.  Mild pulmonary
 edema and small right pleural effusion is unchanged compared to the prior
 study.  Retrocardiac opacity projecting over the lower spine on the lateral
 radiograph may represent atelectasis or small focus of developing pneumonia. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The sternotomy wires
 appear stable.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic.  Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill-defined area of opacification projecting over the lower thoracic spine
 on the lateral view may represent atelectasis or developing pneumonia and
 clinical correlation is advised.
 2.  Cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion are
 unchanged compared to the prior study.
