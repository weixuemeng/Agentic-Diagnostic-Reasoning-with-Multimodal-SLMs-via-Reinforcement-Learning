                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Radiographs are under penetrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to the prior examination. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Redemonstrated is increased
 opacification in the posterior left lower lobe, best seen on the lateral view.
 An accurate comparison is difficult due to differences in technique and lower
 lung volumes but the opacity appears similar to slightly worse.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the spine and
 shoulders are noted.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Posterior left lower lobe opacity is probably similar to
 slightly worse compared to the prior examination, but an accurate comparison
 is difficult due to changes in technique and lung volumes.  There is no
 relevant change otherwise.
