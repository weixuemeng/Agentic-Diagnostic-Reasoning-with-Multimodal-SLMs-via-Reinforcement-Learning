                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An asymmetric peribronchial opacity in the right lower lobe does
 not silhouette the right heart border.  Right peribronchial cuffing is also
 noted.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right peribronchial opacity may be attributed to a central airway
 infection such as a bronchopnuemonia.  However, if symptoms persist, repeat
 radiographs should be performed with shallow oblique views to reassess the
 finding.
