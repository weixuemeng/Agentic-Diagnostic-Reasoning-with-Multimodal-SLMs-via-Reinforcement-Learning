                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and PET-CT, ___.
 
 AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax
 since the prior exam.  The trachea appears slightly shifted to the right,
 suggesting that there is a large pleural effusion on the left side.  Known
 left hilar mass with associated left upper lobe collapse also likely
 contributes to the white out within the left hemithorax.  Patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG.  The right lung appears clear. No
 pneumothorax. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval opacification of the left hemithorax is likely due to a
 combination of a large pleural effusion and left upper lobe collapse due to
 obstructing left hilar mass.
