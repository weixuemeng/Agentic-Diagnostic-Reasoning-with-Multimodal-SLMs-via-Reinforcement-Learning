                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lung mass, short of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, and chest CT ___.  These studies are reference studies from___ and have been
 scanned into PACS for comparison.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  The heart size is top normal.  There has been interval
 opacification of the right upper lobe, likely resulting from post-obstructive
 atelectasis due to the presence of the right upper lobe mass.  Small left
 pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size compared to the prior
 study.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized, though mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacification of the right upper lobe likely representing
 postobstructive collapse due to the presence of the right upper lobe lung
 mass.  Small left pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size compared
 to the prior study.
