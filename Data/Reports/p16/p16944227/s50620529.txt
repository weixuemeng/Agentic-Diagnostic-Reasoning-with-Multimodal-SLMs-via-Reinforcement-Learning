                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:12 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Intubation after cardiac arrest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 1:00 p.m.:
 
 The endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  Large left pleural effusion
 developed in the setting of left upper lobe collapse is larger now than it was
 at 1:00 p.m. shifting the mediastinum further to the right and collapsing the
 remainder of the left lung as before.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. 
 New right infrahilar consolidation is presumably atelectasis.
