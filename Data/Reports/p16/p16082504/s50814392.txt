                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ERCP.  // assess for aspiration, fluid
 overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. There is rightward tracheal deviation. There is mild
 vascular engorgement and perihilar opacities suggestive of mild pulmonary
 edema. There is a right middle and right lower lobe opacity which could be
 related to edema, aspiration or infection. There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left. No pneumothorax is seen.  Additionally,
 there is some tracheal deviation to the right, which may be due to thyroid
 enlargement/goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacities likely related to edema,
 aspiration or infection.  Recommend re-imaging after diuresis.
 2. Mild vascular engorgement and perihilar opacities consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.
 3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 4. Tracheal deviation to the right, which could be due to thyroid
 enlargement/goiter.  Recommend thyroid ultrasound for further evaluation.
