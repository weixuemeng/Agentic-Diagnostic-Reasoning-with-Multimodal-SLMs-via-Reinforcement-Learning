 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status, cough  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated to the right which limits assessment.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear without evidence of lobar consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Mild left basilar atelectasis is
 noted.  Allowing for patient rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.

 No acute intrathoracic process.
