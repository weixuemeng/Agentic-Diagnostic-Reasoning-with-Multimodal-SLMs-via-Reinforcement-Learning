                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p bentall with   WBC and cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, there is no significant change.  Mild left basilar
 and right midlung atelectasis are likely.  Otherwise, the lungs are grossly
 clear.  Again seen is severely widened mediastinum and heart size due to
 ascending and descending aortic aneurysm and dissection, better assessed on
 prior CT, and unchanged from prior.  Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are
 in place and unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal opacification, though difficult to unequivocally excluded pneumonia
 due to large area of obscured lung.
