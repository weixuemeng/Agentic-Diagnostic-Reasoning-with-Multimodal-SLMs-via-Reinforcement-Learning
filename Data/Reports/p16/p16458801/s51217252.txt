                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Reference is also made to
 the CTA torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain slightly low.  Streak like opacities in the right mid lung
 and a left lower lung likely reflect atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity and
 opacity of the left costophrenic angle may reflect volume loss and
 atelectasis; however, it appears slightly increased from the prior exam and
 concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.
 No pneumothorax.  Small left greater than right pleural effusions persist.
 
 Widened mediastinum and heart size secondary to ascending and descending 
 thoracic aorta aneurysm and dissection are better assessed on the prior CT and
 appears similar on radiograph to the prior exam.  Median sternotomy wires and
 surgical clips in the mediastinum as well as projecting over the right axilla
 are overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right mid lung and left lower lung atelectasis.  However, concurrent
 pneumonia in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Overall unchanged appearance of dilated aorta in keeping with known
 thoracic aorta aneurysm and dissection, better assessed on prior CT.
 
 3.  Small, left greater than right, pleural effusions.
