                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain after aortic surgery.  Assess for congestive
 heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___
 CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  In comparison
 to prior examinations there is apparent widening of the mediastinum which may
 be positional in nature.  The contour of the descending aorta is smooth and
 unchanged since prior examination.  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly,
 stable since prior examination.  A stable left basilar opacity likely
 represents a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Right
 lung is clear.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Mediastinal clips and
 right chest wall clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild apparent widening of the mediastinum, may be positional in nature.
 2.  No pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 4.  Stable left basilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.
