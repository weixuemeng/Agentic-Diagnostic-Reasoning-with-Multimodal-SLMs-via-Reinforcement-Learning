                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent thoracic aortic aneurysm repair now 
 with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic arch stent graft repair, and
 aortic valve replacement with multiple clips noted projecting over the right
 axillary region.  Severe cardiomegaly is again noted with diffusely dilated
 thoracic aortic contour compatible with known dissection and subsequent aortic
 graft repair.  Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, worse in the interval. 
 Retrocardiac opacity appears unchanged compatible with atelectasis with
 similar-appearing small left pleural effusion.  There has been interval
 improvement in the right basilar patchy opacity compatible with improving
 atelectasis, with decreased size of the right pleural effusion which is
 partially loculated in the fissure.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac and mediastinal contours compatible with
 known aortic dissection status post aortic arch graft placement.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly worse in the interval.  Unchanged left
 basilar opacity compatible with atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. 
 Interval decrease in size of small right pleural effusion with improved
 aeration in the right lung base.
