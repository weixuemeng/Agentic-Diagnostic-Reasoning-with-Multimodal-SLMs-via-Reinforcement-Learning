                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of bilateral pleural effusions.  Evaluate for change in size
 after diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate minimal
 interval change since the prior study.  There continues to be a moderate right
 subpulmonic effusion and minimal left pleural effusion with continued
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar atelectasis is also seen. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Aortic valve is again seen and intact median sternotomy wires are
 noted.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interval change in moderate-to-large right and small left
 pleural effusions.
