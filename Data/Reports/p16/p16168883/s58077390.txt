                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable.  Median
 sternotomy wires and aortic valve replacement are noted. Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is new, and a small to moderate right pleural effusion is
 present, a component of which is likely subpulmonic.  Partial obscuration of
 the right hemidiaphragm likely reflects residual infection. Small left pleural
 effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is likely
 attributable to a small to moderate pleural effusion, a component of which is
 likely subpulmonic. Small left pleural effusion. Right basilar opacity likely
 reflects residual pneumonia.
