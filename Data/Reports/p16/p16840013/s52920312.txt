                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains
 approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends to the distal
 stomach.
 
 In the interval, there has been substantial decrease in opacification at the
 right base, with only mild residual atelectatic streaks.  Opacification at the
 left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural
 effusion.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
