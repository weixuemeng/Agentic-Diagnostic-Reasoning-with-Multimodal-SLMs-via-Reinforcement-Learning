  1.  Low lying endotracheal tube terminating 9-mm from the carina, and
  recommend interval withdrawal.  Enteric tube within the stomach.
  
  2.  Persistent right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia with small right
  pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity is slightly worse in the interval, and
  could reflect worsening atelectasis though additional site of infection is not
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 17:18.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating 9-mm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is noted with tip and side port in the stomach.  Re- demonstrated
 is a consolidative opacity in the right lung base which remains concerning for
 pneumonia.  There is likely a small right pleural effusion.  Patchy opacity in
 the left lung base is also noted, slightly more pronounced compared to the
 previous exam, and could reflect atelectasis or additional area of infection. 
 The remainder of the exam is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lying endotracheal tube terminating 9-mm from the carina, and
 recommend interval withdrawal.  Enteric tube within the stomach.
 
 2.  Persistent right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia with small right
 pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity is slightly worse in the interval, and
 could reflect worsening atelectasis though additional site of infection is not
 excluded.
