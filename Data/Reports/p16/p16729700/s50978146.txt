                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and MR studies from the prior
 day and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An extensive opacity involving the right
 lower lobe is consistent with pneumonia, with lesser opacities noted along the
 right upper lobe and probably the lingula.  This includes a nodular focus
 projecting over the right mid lung, new since the prior study also.  There is
 destruction of a mid thoracic interspace with marked wedging of the adjoining
 vertebral bodies.  This appearance is consistent with sequelae of known
 osteomyelitis/discitis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  New opacification in the right lower lobe, with left lesser opacities
 elsewhere, suggesting pneumonia.  
 
 2.  Endplate destruction of a mid thoracic interspace, consistent with sequela
 of spinal infection, including increasing loss in height of adjoining
 vertebral bodies since the prior MR, but better assessed on the accompanying
 dedicated thoracic spine MR performed on the prior day.
