                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  High fever and weakness.  History of chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with volume loss. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The right lung is
 clear. There are a few very small unchanged nodules projecting over the left
 upper lung, none over 5 mm in diameter, probably calcified granulomas.  Vague
 opacity in the lingula appears new and there is minimal posterior basilar
 opacity which could be seen with minor volume loss.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy lingular and left lower lobe opacities, more likely due to atelectasis
 than pneumonia; not a definite source for fever although very early
 development of pneumonia is not excluded.
