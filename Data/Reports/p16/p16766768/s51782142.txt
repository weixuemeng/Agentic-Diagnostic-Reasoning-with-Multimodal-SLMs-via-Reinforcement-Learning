                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CP  // infiltate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate median sternotomy wires which
 appear intact.  Several clips project over the left mediastinal border. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are similar to study dated ___.  Lung volumes are low.  Perihilar peribronchial thickening may reflect
 small airways disease.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No focal opacity
 convincing for pneumonia is identified.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar peribronchial thickening with low volumes and vascular crowding.  No
 focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.
