                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  There are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence
 of pneumonia.  Mild bronchial wall thickening was also present on the prior
 study and may reflect chronic airways inflammation.  There are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
