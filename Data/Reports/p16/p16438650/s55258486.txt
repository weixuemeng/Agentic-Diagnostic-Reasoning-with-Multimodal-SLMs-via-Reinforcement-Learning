                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  There has been interval placement of a
 dual-lead left pectorally implanted pacer with leads terminating in the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is mild
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, compatible with congestion,
 without frank edema. Patchy opacities in the right upper and lower lung fields
 may reflect areas of pneumonia. Left basilar atelectasis is noted. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema. 
 Patchy opacities in the right upper and lower lung field may reflect areas of
 infection.
