 abnormality, most consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Thin flowing
 anterior osteophyte is noted along the thoracic spine.  Interspaces are mildly
 irregular suggesting degenerative change throughout the mid thoracic spine.
