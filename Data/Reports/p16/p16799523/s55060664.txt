                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bruising over right posterior ribs.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  No rib fractures are seen, however,
 this technique is not optimal for evaluation of bony trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
