                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative with poor oxygen saturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  There is a dense oblique streak of atelectasis at the
 left base.  No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles bilaterally could reflect pleural effusion or scarring.
