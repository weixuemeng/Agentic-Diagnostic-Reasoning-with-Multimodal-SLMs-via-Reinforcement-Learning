                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after total abdominal
 hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with difficulty weaning from
 oxygen.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to CT torso
 from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Bilateral basal opacities are
 noted and most likely consistent with atelectasis associated with small amount
 of pleural effusion, particularly on the left.  Infectious process at the
 bases cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is noted.
