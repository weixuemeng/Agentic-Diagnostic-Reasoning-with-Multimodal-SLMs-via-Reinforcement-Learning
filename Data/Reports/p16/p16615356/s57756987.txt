                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multiple complaints status post assault with
 recent chest tube has been pulled.  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Since prior, there has been partial resolution of the
 left basilar opacity which still partially persists and could be due to
 atelectasis or scarring.  Underlying infection is also possible.  There is no
 visualized pneumothorax.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No displaced rib
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial resolution of previously identified left basilar opacity
 compatible with resolving effusion with some persistent linear opacities
 suggestive of scar versus atelectasis, infection not completely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
