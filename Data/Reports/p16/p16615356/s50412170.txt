                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No focal
 areas of consolidation are present within the lungs to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  Healed left-sided rib fractures are unchanged.  No acute,
 displaced right-sided rib fracture is evident on this chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  No chest radiographic evidence of acute, displaced
 right rib fracture, but dedicated rib films would be more sensitive and may be
 considered if clinical suspicion for acute rib fracture is high.
