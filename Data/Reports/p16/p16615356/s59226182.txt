 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears borderline in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A streaky posterior lower lobe opacity is unchanged and most
 consistent with minor atelectasis.  Compared to prior radiograph, there has
 also been no significant change, including asymmetric mild-to-moderate
 widening of the right acromioclavicular joint, which may be post-traumatic.
