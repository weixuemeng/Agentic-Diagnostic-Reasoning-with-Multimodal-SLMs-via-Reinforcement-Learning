                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and hoarse voice.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded.  Apparent bulging of the posterior left mediastinum adjacent to the
 descending aorta, has been attributed to varices on prior studies.  There is
 no evidence of focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild
 interstitial prominence is present, most notably in the right lower lung, with
 no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial prominence with no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema. No pneumonia is present.
