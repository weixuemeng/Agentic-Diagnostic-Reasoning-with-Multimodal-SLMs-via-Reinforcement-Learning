                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of cough.  Rule out pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is an opacity at the right lower lobe, without a definite
 correlate on the lateral radiographs. This is likely secondary to atelectasis,
 however an acute infection cannot be ruled out.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New opacity at the right lower lobe likely secondary to atelectasis, however
 an acute infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 5p on the
 day of the exam.
