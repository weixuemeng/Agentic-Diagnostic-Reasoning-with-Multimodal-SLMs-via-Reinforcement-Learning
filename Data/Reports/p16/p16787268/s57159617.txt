                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Replaced PICC line.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there have been slightly
 improved lung volumes.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  The left
 subclavian PICC line now extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and
 possibly the upper portion of the right atrium.  Bibasilar opacifications
 persist, especially at the left base, consistent with substantial volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.  Associated small pleural effusion is seen.
