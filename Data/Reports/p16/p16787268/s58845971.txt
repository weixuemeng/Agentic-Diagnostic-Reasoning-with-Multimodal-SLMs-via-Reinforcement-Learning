 As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube was removed and
 replaced by a tracheostomy tube. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum but in the interval the patient appears to have developed a
 moderate left pleural effusion with subsequent left basilar atelectasis and
 the retrocardiac atelectasis that is slightly progressive.
 The left subclavian vein continues to be malpositioned in the azygos vein.
