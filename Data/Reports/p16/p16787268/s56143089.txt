  ET tube is approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. A new enteric tube has its
  tip in the stomach.  A portion of the distal loop is omitted from review but
  presumed to also be in the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Faint left
  retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
