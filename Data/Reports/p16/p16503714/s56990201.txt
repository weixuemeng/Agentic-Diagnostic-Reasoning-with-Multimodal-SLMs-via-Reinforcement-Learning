                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  The heart is normal in size and
 there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 The suggested density on the lateral view at the anterior aspect of the mid
 thoracic vertebral body is unchanged and therefore represents bridging
 osteophytes.
