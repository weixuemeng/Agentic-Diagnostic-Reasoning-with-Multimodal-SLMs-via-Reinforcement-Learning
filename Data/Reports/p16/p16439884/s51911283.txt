                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is slightly rotated
 rightward in comparison to the ___ examination.  Again seen is a
 top normal heart size.  There has been interval increase in central vascular
 prominence, with slightly increased haziness at the periphery, which reflects
 mild interstitial edema.  No effusion is seen.  Increased density at the left
 base is more compatible with increased atelectasis and bronchovascular
 crowding in the setting of relatively low lung volumes.  A slight compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged since the
 ___ examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial
 edema.
