                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough, shortness of breath  //
 Infiltrate, edema, effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Coronary
 artery stenting is again visualized.  A moderate size hiatal hernia is
 unchanged as is diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes are low with mild
 patchy opacities in the lung bases.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  Moderate degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Multiple clips project over the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis. 
 Infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2.  Re- demonstration of moderate size hiatal hernia.
