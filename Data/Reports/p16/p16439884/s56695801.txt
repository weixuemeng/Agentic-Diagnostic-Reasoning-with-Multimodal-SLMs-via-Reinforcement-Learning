                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post left
 mastectomy with clips projecting over the left chest wall.  A moderate-sized
 hiatal hernia appears to be present.  Patient is slightly rotated, which
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal
 limits.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse calcifications.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Linear
 opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis.
