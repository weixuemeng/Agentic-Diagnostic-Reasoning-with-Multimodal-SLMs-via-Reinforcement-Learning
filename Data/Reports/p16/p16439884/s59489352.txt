                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  The cardiac silhouette
 size likely is within normal limits.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable, with mild calcification of the thoracic aorta noted
 diffusely, and a moderate size hiatal hernia again noted.  Previous pattern of
 pulmonary edema has essentially nearly completely resolved.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Clips are seen within the left breast.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near complete resolution of previously noted mild pulmonary edema and complete
 resolution of the small pleural effusions.  No radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.
