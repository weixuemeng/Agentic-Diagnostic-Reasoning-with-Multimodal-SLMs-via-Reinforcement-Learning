                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with seizures  // Eval for infectious process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits. No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 Possible minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No focal opacity to
 suggest an area of aspiration pneumonitis at this time. Left convex bowing of
 the trachea likely relates to position of the head. Bony structures are
 grossly unremarkable. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible minimal atelectasis in the left lower lung. Otherwise, no acute
 pulmonary process identified. No findings suggestive of pneumonic infiltrate.
