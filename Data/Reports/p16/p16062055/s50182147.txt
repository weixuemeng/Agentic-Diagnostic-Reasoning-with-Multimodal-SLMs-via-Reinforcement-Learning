                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachybrady syndrome.  // Rule out
 pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of cardiac MRI
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Review of the report from ___ cardiac MRI indicates that the the
 patient is status post repair of aortic coarctation with an apparent
 duplicated SVC including a left SVC.  This likely accounts for the atypical
 cardiomediastinal contours, which are unchanged compared with ___.
 
 Again seen is mild diffuse prominence of the pulmonary vessels.  There is a
 slightly nodular appearance the vessels along the right along medially, not
 significantly changed.
 
 On today's study, there is slight obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm
 suggesting minimal atelectasis at the left base.  There is also hazy opacity
 in the right cardiophrenic region and blunting of the right and question left
 costophrenic angles.
 
 No frank consolidation is detected.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Prominent and (known) atypical cardiomediastinal silhouette, unchanged
 compared with 2 days earlier.
 2. New patchy opacities at both lung bases.  This is likely atelectasis, but
 attention for early pneumonic infiltrates is requested.  Possible small
 bilateral effusions, also new.
 3. Mild prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild CHF, unchanged. 
 It is possible that this is associated with the basilar opacities.
 4. Somewhat atypical nodular pattern to the markings in the right lung of
 uncertain etiology or significance, also unchanged.  While this could
 represent developing CHF, if the patient has atypical symptoms, then CT could
 help for further assessment.
 5. No pneumothorax detected.
