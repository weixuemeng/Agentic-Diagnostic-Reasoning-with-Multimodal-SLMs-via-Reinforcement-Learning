                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ETT OG placement  // eval for placement of ETT,
 OGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 0.9 cm above level
 carinal. It should be withdrawn approximately 3 cm for more optimal
 positioning. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior
 aspect not included on the image.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is noted which may be due to
 underlying pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 Splaying of the carina is seen which can be seen with left atrial enlargement.
 There is suggestion of possible mitral anulus calcification.  Perihilar
 opacities, right greater than left may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema
 however, underlying aspiration or infection may be present. No large pleural
 effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube somewhat low in position, terminating 0.9 cm above the level
 of the carina, recommend withdrawal by approximately 2-3 cm for more optimal
 positioning.
 
 Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm into the left abdomen,
 distal aspect not included on the image.
 
 Right greater than left perihilar and infrahilar opacities may be due to
 asymmetric pulmonary edema however, underlying aspiration and/or infection may
 be present.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:20 p.m. on ___ by Dr. ___ via telephone.
 
 Splaying of the carina  which can be seen with left atrial enlargement.
