                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe epigastric pain with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  This may account for most of the apparent improvement in
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Opacification at the left base is most likely
 related to volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion.  Mild
 atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
