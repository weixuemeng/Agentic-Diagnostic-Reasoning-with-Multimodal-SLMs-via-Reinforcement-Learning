 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal size.  There is
 moderate tortuosity of the aorta and the archs shows patchy calcification, as
 before.  Calcified lymph nodes in the right hilum and in the right lower
 paratracheal region suggest prior granulomatous exposure.  A trace right-sided
 pleural effusion is suspected.  A small effusion is difficult to exclude on
 the left.  There is new mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 The lung volumes are low.  
 
 There is new perihilar fullness as well as indistinct prominent pulmonary
 vascularity with a mild interstitial process, predominantly in the mid lungs,
 suggesting mild vascular congestion.  A band-like opacity in the left upper
 lobe shows a slightly altered morphology and may account for by a nodular
 density measuring up to ___ x 4 mm as imaged in the coronal plane by
 radiography, although a new nodule is possible and it may even correlate with
 a newly apparent posterior nodular opacity in the lateral view projecting over
 the mid to lower thoracic spine.  Patchy basilar opacities suggest additional
 areas of minor atelectasis.  
 
 The bones are probably demineralized.  There is similar exaggerated kyphotic
 curvature at the thoracolumbar junction with mild degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Possible nodule in the left mid lung; evaluation with chest CT is
 recommended when clinically appropriate.
