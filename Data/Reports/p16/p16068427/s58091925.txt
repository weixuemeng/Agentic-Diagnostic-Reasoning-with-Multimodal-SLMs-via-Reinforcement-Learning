 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes are
 again seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  There is
 likely superimposed vascular congestion.  Blunting of posterior costophrenic
 angles is suggestive of small effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.
