                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with COPD with worsening dyspnea, weight gain on
 chronic prednisone for RA/?GCA  // evaluation for PNA, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.  Right mid lung linear scarring with possible
 associated bronchiectasis and rightward shift of the upper mediastinum are re-
 demonstrated.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is persistent elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Re-
 demonstrated right mid lung scarring, possible bronchiectasis, elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm and rightward shift of the upper mediastinum.
