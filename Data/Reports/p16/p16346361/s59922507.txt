                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower lobe crackles, possibly related to CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  The asbestos-related pleural plaques with calcification are unchanged
 in this patient who has had previous resection of two lung nodules.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits and there is no definite vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Atelectatic changes
 are seen at the bases.
 
 No change in the compression fracture in the upper thoracic region.
