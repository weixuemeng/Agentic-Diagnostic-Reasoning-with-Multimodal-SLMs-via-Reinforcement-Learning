                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fall, please evaluate for fracture, pneumothorax, occult
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 unchanged positions in the right atrium and right heart.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with dense mitral annular calcifications is re-
 demonstrated.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise similar.  Known pulmonary nodules
 seen on CT are not well assessed on the current exam.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patient is
 status post vertebroplasty of the T12 vertebral body with fusion hardware
 within the lumbar spine incompletely imaged.  Multiple chronic bilateral rib
 fractures are better assessed on the previous CT.  Right shoulder arthroplasty
 hardware is also incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Multiple bilateral chronic rib
 fractures and T12 compression fracture status post vertebroplasty.
