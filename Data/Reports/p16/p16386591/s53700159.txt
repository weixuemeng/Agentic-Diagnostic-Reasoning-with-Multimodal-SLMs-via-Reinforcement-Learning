                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___ through
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly increased compared to prior
 examination with re-demonstration of calcifications within a mildly tortuous
 thoracic aorta.  Prominent central pulmonary vasculature with cephalization is
 compatible with fluid overload with associated mild interstitial edema.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear but mildly hyperinflated suggestive of COPD.  There is a
 small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left anterior
 chest wall implanted dual-lead pacer is unchanged in position.  Right humeral
 head replacement hardware is incompletely visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly with fluid overload and mild interstitial edema.
 2. Hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.
