                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with episode of anterior chest pain radiating across
 chest and to jaw
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications again seen at the aortic knob.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis/scarring without focal consolidation.
