                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities in both lung
 bases likely reflect a combination of chronic bronchiectasis, subsegmental
 atelectasis, and scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
