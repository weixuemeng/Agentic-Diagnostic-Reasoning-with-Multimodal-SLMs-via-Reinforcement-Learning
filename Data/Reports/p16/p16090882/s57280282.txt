 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, history of asthma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The thoracic inlet is partially obscured by the patient's chin, similar to the
 prior study.  Heart size is within normal limits.  Aortic calcifications are
 again seen.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Linear opacities at
 bilateral lung bases are similar to prior, compatible with atelectasis or
 scarring.  No pulmonary consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence for
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis and
 thoracic endplate degenerative changes are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for pneumonia.
