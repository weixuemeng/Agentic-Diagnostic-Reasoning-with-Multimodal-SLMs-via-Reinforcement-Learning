                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 Again seen are linear opacities at bilateral bases, right greater than left,
 likely due to old scarring.  The remainder of the lungs are clear, without
 infiltrate or effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.
