                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p extubation, now with wheezing  // Please
 evaluate for worsening edema, opacities      Please evaluate for worsening
 edema, opacities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  There again are low lung volumes.  The
 mediastinum appears somewhat more prominent with ill defined aortic margin. 
 This could be a technical artifact, though the possibility of interval
 bleeding would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 There is bilateral pulmonary opacification most likely reflecting worsening
 edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
