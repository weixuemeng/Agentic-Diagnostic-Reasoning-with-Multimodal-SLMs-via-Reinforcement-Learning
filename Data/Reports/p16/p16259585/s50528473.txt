                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with influenza currently intubated, who
 experienced vomiting.  // Please evaluate OG tube and ET tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___ at
 03:58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube projects approximately 7 cm above the carina, at the
 thoracic inlet.  Right IJ central venous catheter is at cavoatrial junction. 
 NG tube tip sub- diaphragmatic.  Bilateral heterogeneous parenchymal opacities
 have increased compared to the prior examination and the interval change could
 be related to increased edema, however, the heterogeneous nodular multifocal
 opacities seen on the prior radiograph raise suspicion for multifocal
 pneumonia or septic emboli. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There is
 no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube should be advanced by approximately 3 cm for optimal
 positioning.
 
 2.  Increased bilateral airspace opacification is likely related to
 superimposed pulmonary edema on previously seen heterogeneous nodular
 bilateral opacities suspicious for multifocal pneumonia or septic emboli.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:27 PM, 10 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
