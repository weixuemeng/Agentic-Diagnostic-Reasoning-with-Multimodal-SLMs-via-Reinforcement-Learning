 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough x 2 weeks and LLL crackles.
 // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are unchanged including
 prominence of the descending aorta.  Assessment of the lung parenchyma
 demonstrates presence of linear opacities projecting over the predominately
 lower lungs that might represent chronic parenchymal scarring versus pleural
 abnormalities O potentially combination of bolus. Unchanged apical bilateral
 scarring is present. No new consolidation to suggest interval development of
 acute process seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
