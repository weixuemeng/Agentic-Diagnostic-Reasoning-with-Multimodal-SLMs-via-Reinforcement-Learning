 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral granulomatous changes, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  A relatively lesser inspiratory effort than on the previous image
 leads to increased crowding of the vascular and interstitial structures at the
 right lung bases.  All other pre-existing parenchymal opacities are constant. 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is minimally increased.  No pleural
 effusions.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
