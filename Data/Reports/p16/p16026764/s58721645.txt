                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mass-like opacity within the right middle
 and lower lobes as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy are re- demonstrated,
 and allowing for differences in technique, there appears to be more hazy
 opacification noted in the right lung base which could suggest postobstructive
 infection.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better demonstrated on the previous
 CT.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or new areas of focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, there may be slightly increased hazy
 opacification in the right lung base which may reflect postobstructive
 infection superimposed upon known malignancy involving the right middle and
 lower lobes.  Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy redemonstrated,
 better depicted on prior CT.
