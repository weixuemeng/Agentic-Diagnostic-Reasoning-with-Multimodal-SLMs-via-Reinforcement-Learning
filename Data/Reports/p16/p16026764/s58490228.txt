 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:48 PM
  Large right lung mass with collapse of the right middle lobe as seen on recent
  CT.  Right hilar contour is inseparable from mass/consolidation.  Prominence
  of the left hilar contour corresponds to hilar lymphadenopathy as seen on CT. 
  Although comparison is difficult, the overall degree does not appear worse
  than on CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with persistent cough and now
 recurrent fevers x 3 days, with concern for postobstructive pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a large right lung mass and
 collapsed right middle lobe, as seen on recent CT and without significant
 interval change.  The paratracheal component of mediastinal adenopathy is
 increased.  Narrowing of the left main bronchus by subcarinal lymph nodes has
 probably increased since the beginning of ___.  There is no clear focal
 opacity suggestive of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right lung mass and collapsed right middle lobe are not significantly
 changed.  No opacity concerning for pneumonia is identified.  
 
 2.  Extensive mediastinal adenopathy may have increased in the right lower
 paratracheal station and in the subcarinal, narrowing the left main bronchus.
