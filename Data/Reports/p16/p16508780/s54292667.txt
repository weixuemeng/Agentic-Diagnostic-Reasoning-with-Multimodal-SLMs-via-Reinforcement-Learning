                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent right middle lobe pneumonia. 
 Evaluate for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.
 Band like density at the right cardiac border which may represent right middle
 lobe pneumonia. An additional vague opacity in the left lower lobe also may
 represent atelectasis versus consolidation. Minimal left apical scarring is
 present. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Band like density at the right cardiac border which may represent
 right middle lobe pneumonia. An additional vague opacity in the left lower
 lobe also may represent atelectasis versus consolidation. 
 
 Recommend direct comparison with prior outside radiographs for further
 assessment of progression of disease.
