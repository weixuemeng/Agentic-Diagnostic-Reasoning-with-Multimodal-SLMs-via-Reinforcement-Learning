                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent HCAP. Planning to admit for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP radiograph was provided.  Since the most recent
 radiograph from ___, there is now increased opacity involving the
 right mid and lower lung, concerning for infectious process as seen previously
 on ___.  New opacity at the left base may be infectious in etiology
 or atelectasis.  There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle due to
 small pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Clips are seen along the left heart border. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC catheter terminates in the upper-to-mid
 SVC.
  
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased consolidation in the right mid and lower lung consistent with
 pneumonia.  Small opacity at the left base may be atelectasis versus
 infection.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Right PICC in the upper-to-mid SVC.
