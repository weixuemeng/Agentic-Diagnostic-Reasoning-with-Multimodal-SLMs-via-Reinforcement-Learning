                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pneumonia.  Evaluation for progression or resolution.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Previously noted opacities in the
 right mid and lower lung are again noted.  As compared to the prior exam there
 is some increased opacity in the right upper lung.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 The right hilum is prominent suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is tortuosity of the
 aorta.
 
 A previously placed right-sided PICC now courses superior to the right
 internal jugular vein with tip out of view of radiograph and needs
 repositioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Stable to slightly increased opacities in the right
 hemithorax could represent asymmetric edema though pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.
 2.  Interval migration of right-sided PICC now directed towards the right
 internal jugular vein with tip out of view of the radiograph and needs
 repositioning.  
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:05 p.m. ___.
