                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam.  Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged, increased compared to the previous exam, but this is likely
 accentuated due to the lower lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Calcified right mediastinal node is compatible with prior
 granulomatous disease.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures,
 with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema
 is demonstrated.  Bibasilar opacities are seen in the lung bases, most
 compatible with atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is visualized.  Right-sided indentation upon the trachea at
 the thoracic inlet may reflect an underlying thyroid goiter, and is unchanged.
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are re- demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
