                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall with left anterior rib pain
 below the breast. Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. No displaced
 rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chest radiographs are not sensitive for
 evaluation of subtle chest trauma, and oblique views or dedicated rib series
 with markers can be obtained.
