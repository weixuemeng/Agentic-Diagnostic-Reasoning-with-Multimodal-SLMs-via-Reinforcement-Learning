                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Rhonchi, cough and malaise.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is slight coarsening of the central airways, which may
 reflect an inflammatory process, but no focal consolidation is present.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine,
 including a slight wedging of a mid-to-lower thoracic vertebral body are
 similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for acute disease, although mild coarsening
 of central lung markings may reflect an inflammatory process involving the
 lower airways.
