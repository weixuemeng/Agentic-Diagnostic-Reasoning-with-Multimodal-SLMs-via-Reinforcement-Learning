                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new crackles left lower lobe, cough,
 fever. Hyponatremia  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Within the left lower lobe peripherally there is a new small nodular opacity. 
 This could represent lung focal consolidation/atelectasis in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  There is coarse reticular interstitial opacities in the
 lung bases likely representing chronic scarring.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged in appearance with coarse calcifications of the mitral
 annulus.  No pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative changes of the right
 glenohumeral joint are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A new focal peripheral left lower lobe opacity.  Although very nonspecific, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, it could represent a developing/early
 pneumonia.  The remainder of the lungs are otherwise unchanged in appearance.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A follow-up chest radiograph in 4 weeks is suggested to
 ensure resolution.
