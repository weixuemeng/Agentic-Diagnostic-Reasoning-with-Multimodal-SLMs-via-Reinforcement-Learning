                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dCHF, assess for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval with increased
 size of small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Worsening
 focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval, with increased size of small
 bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.  Worsening bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
