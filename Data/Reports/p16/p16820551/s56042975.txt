 atelectasis.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable with left paramediastinal scarring.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusions appear to blunt

 Probable small pleural effusions blunting the costophrenic sulci bilaterally
 are unchanged.
