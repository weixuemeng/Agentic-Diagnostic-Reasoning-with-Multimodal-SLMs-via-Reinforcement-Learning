                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal consolidation has developed within the right lower lobe,
 most marked in the right infrahilar region and in the periphery of the right
 lung base.  This is accompanied by bronchial wall thickening.  Remainder of
 the lungs are clear.  No definite pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Bilateral hilar prominence is unchanged from the prior
 examination, and mediastinal contours remain normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe bronchopneumonia.  Followup chest radiograph in
 four to six weeks may be helpful to document resolution following appropriate
 therapy.
 
 Longstanding bilateral hilar prominence suggesting chronic but stable hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Given the symmetry, chronic sarcoidosis is a likely
 consideration.
 
 Findings emailed to Dr. ___ on the date of the study.
