                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with possible pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of a large left pleural effusion,
 substantially enlarged from the previous study.  Small right pleural effusion
 also appears somewhat increased from prior.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 No pulmonary edema is clearly noted.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are seen.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left and small right pleural effusions, larger in the interval. 
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
