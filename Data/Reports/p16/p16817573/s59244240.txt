                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with renal cell carcinoma and lung metastasis,
 aortic stenosis, and systolic CHF with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Compared with prior, there has been no significant
 interval change.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases are again seen. 
 Right lateral loculated pneumothorax and air-fluid levels at the right lung
 base are essentially unchanged.  Overall, there is no definite new region of
 consolidation, although subtle changes would be obscured by a diffuse burden
 of disease.  Mediastinal masses are again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 overall is unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since previous exam of parenchymal
 and mediastinal masses and right lateral pneumothorax, similar in
 configuration compared to most recent exam from ___.
