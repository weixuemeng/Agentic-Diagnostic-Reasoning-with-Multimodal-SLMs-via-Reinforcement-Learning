                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Renal cell carcinoma with lung metastases, hemoptysis today on
 Coumadin.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains moderately
 enlarged.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again demonstrated, similar compared
 to the prior CT torso.  Multiple ill-defined nodular opacities are noted in
 both lungs, which have certainly progressed when compared to the prior chest
 radiograph from ___ and appear increased in size when compared to
 the prior CT torso, allowing for differences in modalities.  Small right
 pleural effusion is slightly increased when compared to the prior study.  No
 pulmonary edema is definitely noted.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base
 may reflect compressive atelectasis and/or pulmonary vascular congestion,
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  There are degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of ill-defined nodular opacities in
 both lungs compatible with pulmonary metastases.  Small right pleural effusion
 has increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph, with patchy
 ill-defined opacity in the right lung base which may reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not completely excluded. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
 re-demonstrated.
