                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumothorax, rib fracture.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 A tiny left apical pneumothorax is suggested.  In addition, there is relative
 hyperlucency in the upper and mid portions of the left lung and the
 possibility of an anterior component to the pneumothorax cannot be excluded. 
 A left-sided chest tube is in place.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged.  There is
 patchy opacity at the right base, consistent with some degree of collapse
 and/or consolidation with a small effusion.  There is retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  No left-sided effusion.  Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along
 the left chest wall and extending into the left neck.  Fracture of the left
 eighth and ? left ninth posterior ribs noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided chest tube.  Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax. 
 left lower rib fractures noted.
