                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to previous radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest tube has changed in position, with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Worsening bibasilar
 opacities are suggestive of atelectasis, and note is made of a persistent
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  Subcutaneous emphysema on the left
 has slightly improved.
