                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple rib fxs, dyspnea, LLE swelling and
 erythema  // Eval for PTX, DVT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are seen including likely the lateral right
 third through seventh ribs.  Comminuted mid right clavicular fracture is seen.
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 suggests small pleural effusions, right greater than left.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen although a small pneumothorax would be difficult to
 exclude radiographically.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures and small to moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Possible small left pleural effusion.  No discrete pneumothorax
 seen although CT would be more sensitive.
 
 Comminuted mid right clavicular fracture is seen.
