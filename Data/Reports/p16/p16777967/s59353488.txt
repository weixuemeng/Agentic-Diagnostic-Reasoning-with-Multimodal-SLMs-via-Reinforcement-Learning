                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent prior study from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta is mild
 to moderately tortuous, as before, with calcification along the arch.  There
 is new haziness of pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild vascular congestion,
 although diffuse inflammation could also be considered.  In addition a focal
 right perihilar opacification has developed, worrisome for pneumonia.  Less
 likely, a relatively focal appearance of pulmonary edema could be considered. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Although there is new diffuse mild haziness of pulmonary
 vascularity, suggestive of slight congestion or fluid overload, or perhaps a
 diffuse inflammatory process, a focal right perihilar opacity is most
 suggestive of pneumonia.
