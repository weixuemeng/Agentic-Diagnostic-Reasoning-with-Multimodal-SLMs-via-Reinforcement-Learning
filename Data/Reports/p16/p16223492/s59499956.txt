                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tube tx*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // eval ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:29 performed at an outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.8 cm above level the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses below level the diaphragm, terminating in the expected
 location of the stomach.  Interval increase in prominence of the bilateral
 hila suggests central pulmonary edema, vascular engorgement, underlying
 aspiration not excluded.  .  Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Linear left mid lung opacity most likely represents atelectasis/
 scarring.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position.  Persistent
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Interval increase in
 prominence of the hila suggests central pulmonary edema, vascular engorgement,
 underlying aspiration not excluded.
