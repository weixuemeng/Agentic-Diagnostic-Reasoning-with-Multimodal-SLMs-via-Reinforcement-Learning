 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain radiating to the right.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure
 projecting along the medial right upper chest, consistent with a normal
 variant.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There is slight pleural thickening at the right apex, but no
 evidence for pneumothorax.  There is lordotic curvature along the lower
 thoracic spine and slight rightward convex thoracic curvature. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute disease.
