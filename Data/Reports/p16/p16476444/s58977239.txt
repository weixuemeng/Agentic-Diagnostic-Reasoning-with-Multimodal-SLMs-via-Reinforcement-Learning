                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest wall defibrillator has a single lead terminating in the
 right ventricle.  The lungs are normally expanded despite a mild generalized
 interstitial abnormality.  Peribronchial opacification in the right infrahilar
 lung could be pneumonia or the first expression of edema.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Eversion of the
 diaphragmatic pleural surfaces is due to small effusions or pleural scarring. 
 Pleural thickening or scarring at the right lung apex is mild. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality, chronicity indeterminate, given mild
 cardiomegaly, could be interstitial edema.
 2.  Possible RLL pneumonia or early edema.
