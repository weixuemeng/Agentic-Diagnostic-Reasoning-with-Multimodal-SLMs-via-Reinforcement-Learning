                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF (EF ___%), presenting with worsened
 dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 with emphysematous changes re- demonstrated, most pronounced in the upper
 lobes.  Right middle lobe collapse is demonstrated along with patchy
 opacification in the right lower lobe concerning for infection.  There is a
 moderate size right pleural effusion as well as a probable trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Scarring is noted in the lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right middle lobe collapse.  Chest CT with contrast for further assessment
 of right middle lobe collapse is recommended.
 2. Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
 3. Moderate size right and trace left bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Emphysema.
