 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:03 PM
  Hazy increased opacification of the right lower lung with linear streaky
  opacities projecting over the right lung base posteriorly and expected
  location of the right middle lobe on lateral view, which may be secondary to
  atelectasis and/or infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia at the right base on portable chest x-ray, evaluation
 for empyema or progression of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 increased density at the right lung base.  The opacity, which is at the source
 of this density, is better visualized on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph.  Minimal areas of opacity is also seen in the bases of the middle
 lobe.
 
 Overall, the findings could be either atelectatic in nature or represent a
 combination between atelectasis and infection.  No effusion is seen.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  Left pectoral
 Port-A-Cath in unchanged position.
