                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable radiograph of the chest is provided.  There are
 bilateral lower lobe opacities.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lung volumes are very low.  There is a
 double-lumen catheter terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with lower lobe opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis, but should be correlated clinically to rule out an infectious
 process.  See subsequent CT for further details.
