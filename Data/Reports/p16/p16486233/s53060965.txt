                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  A double-lumen
 catheter terminating near the cavoatrial junction in stable position.  There
 is a new right IJ terminating in the right atrium.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal and symmetric.  There is no
 frank pulmonary edema.  Plate-like atelectasis at the bases persists but is
 improved.  There is no new focal airspace consolidation. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ terminates in the right atrium.  Slight improvement
 in bibasilar atelectasis, otherwise no significant change from the prior
 study.
