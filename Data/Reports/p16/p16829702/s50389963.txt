 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall 2 days prior w/ R rib fx now worsening
 hypoxia, evolving hypotension  // eval ? pulm edema, worsening R pulm
 contusions     eval ? pulm edema, worsening R pulm contusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph 01:11.
 
 Mediastinum is newly widened, in a fashion suggesting vascular engorgement
 rather than hemorrhage, although bleeding is not excluded.  Mild cardiac
 enlargement is also new.
 
 Consolidation in the right midlung is more severe and there is new
 interstitial abnormality in the lung bases.  Findings could be explained by
 volume overload and edema in the setting of a right pneumonia.
