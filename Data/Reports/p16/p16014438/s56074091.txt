 INDICATION:  History: ___F with h/o DM presenting with cough with some blood
 tinged sputum.  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Subtle, increased density in the right middle lobe
 appears increased from the prior examination, and may reflect aspiration
 versus developing pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with right middle lobe airspace consolidation which appears
 new from the prior examination, worrisome for aspiration versus developing
 pneumonia.
