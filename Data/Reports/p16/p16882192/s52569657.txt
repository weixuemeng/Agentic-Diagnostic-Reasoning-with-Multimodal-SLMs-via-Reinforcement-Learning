                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of altered mental status
 and fall, tachycardic.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Appears slightly
 increased in size compared to the prior study, although this may relate to AP
 technique and lower lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No focal consolidation.  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette,
 appears slightly larger as compared to the prior study, although this may
 relate to differences in inspiration/technique.
