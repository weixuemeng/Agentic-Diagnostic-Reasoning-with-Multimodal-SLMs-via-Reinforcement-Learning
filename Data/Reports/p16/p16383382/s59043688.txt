                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and shortness of breath, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show bilateral
 perihilar opacities, more prominent on the right than the left.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are also present on the left greater than the
 right.  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The thoracic aorta is slightly unfolded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  In the correct clinical context, a superimposed pneumonia should
 be considered.  A repeat chest radiograph is recommended following diuresis to
 evaluate for resolution and exclude pneumonia.
