                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat
 hyperexpanded with increased AP diameter of the thorax which can be seen in
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Small left-sided pleural effusion is
 noted with perhaps trace right effusion. These were present on prior T-spine
 CT from ___. Pleural fluid may also be present along the left major
 fissure. Bilateral hilar calcified lymph nodes along with right apical
 calcified nodule are consistent with prior granulomatous disease.  The heart
 is intervally enlarged with otherwise normal mediastinal contours and mild
 vascular congestion without overt edema.  Near complete collapse of the T11
 vertebral body is noted with post vertebroplasty changes.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Small left and trace right pleural effusions.
