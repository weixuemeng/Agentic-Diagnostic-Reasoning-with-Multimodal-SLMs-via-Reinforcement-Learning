                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, similar to prior
 examination.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Calcifications are noted within the thoracic aortic arch.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion with trace interstitial edema.  A right apical
 granuloma is unchanged.  Lungs are otherwise clear without focal
 consolidations.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous
 structures are globally demineralized in appearance.  There is severe
 compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body and deformity of the
 right proximal humerus similar in appearance to prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with vascular congestion and trace
 pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Unchanged
 severe compression deformity of the lower thoracic vertebral body.
