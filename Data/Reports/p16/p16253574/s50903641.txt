                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal view.
 
 HISTORY:  LEFT RIB FRACTURES, S/P TINY PTX
 
 COMPARE:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously seen tiny left apical pneumothorax on prior CT is not well seen on
 this study, CT is more sensitive.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again
 seen.  There is left base retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to
 atelectasis, but underlying infection and/or aspiration may be present.  The
 right lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.
