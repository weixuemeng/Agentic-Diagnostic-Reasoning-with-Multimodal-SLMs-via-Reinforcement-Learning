                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Adrenal insufficiency, increased fatigue and dehydration, question
 infection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:57 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  No CHF or
 acute focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The lungs are hyperinflated and
 diaphragms are flattened, consistent with COPD.  Again seen is a large area of
 pleural thickening along the left mid chest wall and a small nodular opacity
 measuring approximately 5.4 mm in the right upper zone laterally, overlying
 the inferior edge of the right anterior second rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 2.  COPD.
 
 3.  Right upper zone nodule and focally marked thickening of the pleura along
 the left chest wall, possibly related to an old rib fracture, but not fully
 characterized.  Recommend further assessment with chest CT or, alternatively,
 comparison with remote prior chest x-rays (not on PACS record for further
 assessment).
