                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question evidence of infection.
 Review of prior radiology studies indicates a history of breast and
 endometrial CA.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 I suspect background hyperinflation.  However, there is no flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Rather, there is prominent convexity of both diaphragms and the
 right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  This appearance is unchanged
 compared with targeted review of a chest CT from ___.
 
 There is probable mild cardiomegaly.  There is also minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  There is possible minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly.  The aorta is partially calcified.  No CHF,
 focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified.  No mediastinal or hilar
 enlargement is detected.  
 
 There is a ring-like density with additional tubing projecting over the
 expected location of the EG junction, presumably related to a prior gastric
 banding procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Doubt gross change compared with chest x-ray from ___.No acute
 pulmonary process identified.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  
 
 3.  Gastric banding device noted.
