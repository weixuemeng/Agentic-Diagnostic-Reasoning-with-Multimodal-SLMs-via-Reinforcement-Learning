                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back through ___, including
 the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities are increased compared to
 ___, most recently ___. Mild cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary vascular engorgement are indications of chronic CHF.
 
 A large opacity at the base of the left lung, conforming to one of the large
 convexities in the posterior sulci of both hemithoraces on the lateral view,
 could be the left component of bilateral pleural effusions, but could also be
 a lung abscess. If this is clinically suspected, CT scanning should be
 performed.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Consider lung abscess as an alternative to dependent pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Chronic mild CHF.
