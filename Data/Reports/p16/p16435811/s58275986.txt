                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The central line is unchanged.  The multiple sclerotic bone lesions compatible
 with metastatic disease are again seen.  The heart size is moderately
 enlarged.  There is  pulmonary vascularity redistribution and ill-defined
 vascularity compatible with CHF.  There are patchy alveolar infiltrates
 bilaterally lower lobe greater than upper lobe.  It is unclear if this is due
 to pulmonary edema or an infectious etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Compared to the prior study of pulmonary status is worsened.  It is unclear if
 this is all due to pulmonary edema or there is an underlying infectious
 etiology.
