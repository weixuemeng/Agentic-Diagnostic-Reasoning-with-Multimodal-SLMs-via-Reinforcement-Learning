                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, cough.  Please evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  Faint focal opacification at the
 left lung base is seen, although is not substantiated on the lateral view.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Faint opacity at the left lung base may relate to atelectasis, and
 is not clearly substantiated on the lateral view, but early
 consolidation/infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical settng.
