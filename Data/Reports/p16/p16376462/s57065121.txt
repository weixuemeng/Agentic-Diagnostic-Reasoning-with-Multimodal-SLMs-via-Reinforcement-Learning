                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elevated lactate.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  As on prior study, there are increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally, particularly at the periphery.  This is not significantly changed
 since the CT of ___.  Again there is chronic tenting of the right
 mediastinum.  The heart is slightly enlarged.  There is no frank pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Chronic interstitial abnormality is similar to the next most
 recent chest radiograph.  No new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
