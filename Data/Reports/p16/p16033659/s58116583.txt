                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette persists.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or findings to suggest
 pneumothorax.  There is persistent anterior eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Opacity projecting over the right cardiophrenic angle most
 likely relates to epicardial fat pad; right middle lobe collapse is felt much
 less likely given lack of findings on the lateral view or other secondary
 findings of new collapse.
