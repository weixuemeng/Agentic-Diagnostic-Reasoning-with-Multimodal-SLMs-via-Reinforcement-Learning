  1. No displaced rib fracture.
  2. Indistinct airspace opacity in the right lung base may be related to
  atelectasis from low lung volumes or early consolidation, depending upon the
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall, evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Indistinct airspace opacities in the right lung base may
 represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes or early focal
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax,
 or displaced rib fracture.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No displaced rib fracture.
 2. Indistinct airspace opacity in the right lung base may be related to
 atelectasis from low lung volumes or early consolidation, depending upon the
 clinical setting.
