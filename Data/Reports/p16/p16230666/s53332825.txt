                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // ? pna      ? pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  Lower lung volumes accentuate the
 transverse diameter of the heart.
 The right heart border is not as sharply seen as on the previous study. This
 raises the possibility of middle lobe pneumonia, though this appearance could
 merely be a manifestation of crowding of normal pulmonary vessels in a patient
 with low lung volumes.
