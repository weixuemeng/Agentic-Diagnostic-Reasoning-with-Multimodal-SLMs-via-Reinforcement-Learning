                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated, needs cxr to confirm placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Enteric
 tube tip is within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains at
 least mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures is present with probable mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Ill-defined patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases,
 potentially areas of infection or aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 3. Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect areas of
 infection or aspiration.
