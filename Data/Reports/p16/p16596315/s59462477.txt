                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded and
 demonstrates diffuse calcification.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of
 the diaphragms and attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the
 lung apices, findings compatible with emphysema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Emphysema.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
