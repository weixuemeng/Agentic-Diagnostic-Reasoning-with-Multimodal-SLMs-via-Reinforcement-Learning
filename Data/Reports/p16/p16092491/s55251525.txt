                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confusion and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 possible subtle patchy left basilar opacity which seemed due to atelectasis,
 although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The right lung is clear.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged which may be accentuated
 by epicardial fat pad.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible subtle patchy left basilar opacity could be due to
 atelectasis, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
