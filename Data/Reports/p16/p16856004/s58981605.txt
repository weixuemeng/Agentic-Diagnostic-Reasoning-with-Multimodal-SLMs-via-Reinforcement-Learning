                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and low-grade temperature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Right lung base is markedly elevated in a fashion that could be either a
 diaphragmatic eventration or even a chronic contained diaphragmatic rupture. 
 Small right pleural effusion is collected in the anterior and posterior
 pleural sulci.  A large elliptical area of opacity at the right base is
 probably atelectasis.  A barely visible rounded lesion, about 7 cm in diameter
 projecting over the descending thoracic aorta could be a hiatus hernia or mass
 in the left lung or saccular thoracic aortic aneurysm.  Any prior
 cross-sectional imaging that includes a lower chest should be consulted. 
 Oblique views might be helpful for elucidation short of CT scanning.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Upper lungs are clear.  Thoracic aorta is generally large. 
 The heart is mildly dilated.
