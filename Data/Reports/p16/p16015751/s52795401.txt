                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decreased breath sounds on the right.
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable but there is interval development of interstitial
 pulmonary edema, associated with bilateral pleural effusions, small, but
 appear to be increased since the prior study.  The worsening in the right
 lower lung although most likely associated with edema, can potentially
 represent interval development of right lower lobe pneumonia.  Attention to
 this area on the subsequent radiographs is recommended and if clinical
 symptoms of pneumonia are present, it should be treated as pneumonia.
