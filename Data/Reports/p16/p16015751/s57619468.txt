 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.

 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a
 vague nodular focus projecting over the right lateral lung measuring about 8
 mm in diameter.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.

 a nipple shadow, but confirmation with a repeat PA view with nipple markers is
 recommended when clinically appropriate.  No evidence of acute disease.
