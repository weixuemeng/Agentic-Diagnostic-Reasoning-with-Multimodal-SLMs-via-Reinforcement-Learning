  Nodular opacity projecting near an EKG lead in the left upper lung; true lung
  nodule including the possibility of malignancy should be considered versus
  atelectasis, scarring or artifact.  Noting the EKG lead, repeat films with
  removal and PA/lateral technique could be considered for initial further
  evaluation although chest CT should be considered if it were to persist.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  No prior chest radiographs; lumbar spine radiographs are
 available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a nodular opacity projecting adjacent
 to an EKG lead in the left upper lobe.  The lungs appear otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild leftward convex curvature
 centered along the mid thoracic spine with mild to moderate rightward convex
 curvature centered at the thoracolumbar junction including apparent mild loss
 and a lumbar vertebral body.  The latter appearance, however, is probably
 unchanged since the prior lumbar spine radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Apparent nodular opacity projecting near the site of an EKG lead at the
 left lung apex.  Differential considerations include a lung nodule including
 the possibility of malignancy although atelectasis, scarring or artifact could
 also be considered.  Initial re-evaluation is recommended with PA and lateral
 radiographs in the short term when clinically appropriate.  If the density
 were to persist, then chest CT may be appropriate to evaluate further.  
 
 Findings and recommendations posted to the ER dashboard while the patient was
 still in the ER.
