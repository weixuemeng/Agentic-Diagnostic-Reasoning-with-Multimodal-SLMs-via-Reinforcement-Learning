                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.  The opacity at the
 right base appears slightly increased since the prior chest radiograph in
 ___.  There is mild vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific bibasilar opacities, slightly increased on the right. These are in
 the typical location for atelectasis, though a developing pneumonia or
 aspiration are consideration given the interval increase.  Recommend
 correlation with infectious symptoms and close radiographic follow-up if
 indicated.
