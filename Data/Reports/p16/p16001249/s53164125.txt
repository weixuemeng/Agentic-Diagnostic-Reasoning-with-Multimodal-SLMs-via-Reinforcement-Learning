                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with failure to thrive
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with dense mitral annular calcifications again seen. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in the lung bases,
 not substantially changed from the prior study, and most likely suggestive of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 present.  Hypertrophic changes are re- demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
