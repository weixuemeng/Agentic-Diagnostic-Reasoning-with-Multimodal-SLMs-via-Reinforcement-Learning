                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, status-post minimally invasive esophagectomy for
 esophageal cancer. Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right Port-A-Cath appears intact and unchanged in position. Stable
 bilateral lung volumes. Streaky densities at the right lung base, consistent
 with subsegmental atelectasis, are unchanged. Small left pleural effusion,
 also not significantly changed. Stable cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouette
 with a right-sided neoesophagus causing apparent widening of the mediastinum.
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 More prominent small crescentic lucency which appears to be outlining the
 diaphragm and may represent a small pneumoperitoneum. Contrast from recent
 barium study is still demonstrated within an air-filled colon.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Possible small pneumoperitoneum.  Recommend follow-up radiographs to
 assess for change.
 
 2.  Stable right lower lung atelectasis.
 
 3.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___, the referring provider, on the telephone on ___ at
