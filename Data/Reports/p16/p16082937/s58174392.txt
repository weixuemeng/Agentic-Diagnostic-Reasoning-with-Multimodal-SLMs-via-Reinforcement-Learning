 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer  // ptx, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits. Radiodense element overlies the lower
 mediastinum and may be within an external surgical dressing but clinical
 correlation suggested to exclude a retained foreign object in this patient
 status post recent surgery.  Lungs are clear except for minor bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Hyperlucency in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may
 reflect free intraperitoneal air com especially given a small curvilinear
 lucency adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 is present bilaterally, but there is no definite pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 10:18 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
