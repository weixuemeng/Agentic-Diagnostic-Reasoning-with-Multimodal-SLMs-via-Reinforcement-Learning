                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers, ?seizures  // ? pneumonia or
 aspiration      ? pneumonia or aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 21:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 17 33 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is some overlying motion limiting evaluation of
 the lung parenchyma. However, there is increasing patchy retrocardiac opacity,
 which in the setting of low lung volumes, may reflect atelectasis, although
 aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema. Interposition of the colon under the right hemidiaphragm consistent
 with Chiladiti's. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.
