 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Other
 monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  The side port of the
 nasogastric tube appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction. 
 Some atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the right. If
 there is serious clinical concern for aspiration, this would have to be
 considered at the right base.
