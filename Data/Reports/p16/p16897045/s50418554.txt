                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent productive cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia or
 evidence of heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Streaky opacities in
 the right lung base are compatible with atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without evidence of focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits and unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracolumbar spine.  Lumbar
 spinal hardware is incompletely evaluated.  There are healing fractures of the
 left posterolateral eighth and ninth ribs, which are new from the prior study.
 A left-sided pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right ventricle and
 right atrium is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Healing left posterolateral eighth and ninth rib fractures, new from
 ___.
