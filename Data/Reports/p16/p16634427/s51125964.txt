                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with heart transplant.  // chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.
 
 As before, the patient is status post sternotomy there is possible mild
 cardiomegaly, though this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes and
 portable AP technique.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 There is slight increase in hazy retrocardiac opacity, consistent with early
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.   Otherwise, no focal opacity
 identified.  No effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution.
 
 Slight increase in faint retrocardiac opacity, consistent with atelectasis.  
 An early left lower lobe infectious infiltrate is considered less likely but
 cannot be entirely excluded.
