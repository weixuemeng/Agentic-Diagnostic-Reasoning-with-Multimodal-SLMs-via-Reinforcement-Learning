                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Systolic dysfunction, orthopnea, and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  The technologist noted that the
 patient has undergone recent rotator cuff surgery of the right arm and was
 unable to lift this arm for the lateral view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs were acquired.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 not significantly changed, allowing for slightly low lung volumes on today's
 study.  Subtle interstitial opacities with a perihilar predominance are
 compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  A trace left pleural effusion is possible.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
