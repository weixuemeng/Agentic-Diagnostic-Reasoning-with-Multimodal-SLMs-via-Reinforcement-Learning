                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of cardiomyopathy, now presenting
 with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___ and concurrent
 CTA of the chest.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  An ICD generator overlies the left
 chest wall.  The single lead is intact and terminates over the expected
 location of the right ventricle, unchanged from prior.  Bibasilar opacities
 correspond with ground-glass opacities seen on concurrent CT and are
 consistent with dependent pulmonary edema.  There is also mild septal
 thickening and hilar engorgement, which supports pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from
 most recent prior examination.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard expected position of AICD generator and lead.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema, no large pleural effusions.
 3.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
