                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, status
 post ICD yesterday.  Check lead placement and rule out pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Significant cardiac enlargement, but the absence of any typical
 configuration abnormality is compatible with the clinical diagnosis of dilated
 cardiomyopathy.  A permanent pacer is seen in left anterior axillary position
 connected to a single intracavitary electrode (ICD) seen to terminate in the
 apical portion of the right ventricle.  Inconspicuous appearance of thoracic
 aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of acute
 infiltrates or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___,
 findings are completely unchanged.  In comparison with a more remote chest
 examination of ___, the at that time existing more marked
 cardiomegaly has regressed and the pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable position of newly placed ICD device.
