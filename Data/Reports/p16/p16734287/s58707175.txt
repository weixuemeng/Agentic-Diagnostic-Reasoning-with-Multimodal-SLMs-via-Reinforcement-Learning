  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, atelectasis or potentially pneumonia; a
  component of this appears nodular and may reflect a true nodule - short-term
  follow-up radiographs are suggested to reassess versus evaluation with chest
  CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Question effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a patchy right
 infrahilar opacity including a nodular focus of about 15 mm in diameter,
 although perhaps part of a developing consolidation.  Posterior and lateral
 costophrenic sulci are blunted, so there may be potentially tiny bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature
 and moderate degenerative changes are noted along the mid-to-lower thoracic
 spine.  Vascular calcifications are widespread.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right infrahilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia, but
 including a nodular component.  The possibility of a true lung nodule should
 be considered.  Either evaluation with dedicated chest CT, preferably with
 intravenous contrast, if possible, or short-term followup radiographs are
 recommended to assess further.
