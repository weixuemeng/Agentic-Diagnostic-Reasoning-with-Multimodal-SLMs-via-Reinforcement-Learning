                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and atrial fibrillation; rule out
 CHF/pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views are compared with most recent radiographs as well as CECT
 of the chest, both dated ___.  
 
 Since those studies, the findings of mild CHF, including small bilateral
 pleural effusions and slight vascular blurring, representing interstitial
 edema, have cleared.  The lungs are now better inflated and clear, without
 focal airspace process.  There is residual cardiomegaly with, in particular,
 left atrial enlargement and there is dense dystrophic calcification of the
 mitral annulus, as before.  There is chronic scarring at the left lung base
 with a calcified granuloma at that lung apex, as before.  
 
 The remainder of the examination is notable for atherosclerosis involving the
 thoracic aorta and marked diffuse osteopenia with loss of height of several
 mid-thoracic vertebrae and resultant kyphosis, not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resolution of the findings of CHF, with improved lung volumes.
 2.  No new focal airspace process.
