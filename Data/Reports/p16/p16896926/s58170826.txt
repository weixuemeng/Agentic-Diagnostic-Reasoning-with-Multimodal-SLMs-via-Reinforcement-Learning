                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and joint pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Particularly well visualized on the lateral view is a posterior
 infrahilar opacification which may be associated with bronchopneumonia but
 noting low lung volumes, atelectasis could be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior basilar opacities which are probably in the left lower
 lobe and likely attributed to minor atelectasis.  If infection is suspected
 clinically then short-term radiographs could be considered for followup,
 however.
