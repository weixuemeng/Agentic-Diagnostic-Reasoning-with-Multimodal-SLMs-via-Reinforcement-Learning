  1. Heterogeneous opacity within right lower lobe with small right pleural
  effusion likely represents component of asymmetric pulmonary edema however
  superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
  2. Persistent severe cardiomegaly is accentuated due to low lung volumes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with resp distress. Assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and mild pulmonary
 edema. Heterogeneous opacity within the right lower lobe noted. No left
 pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Persistent
 severe cardiomegaly is accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal
 contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacity at the right lung base may reflect
 asymmetric edema although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
