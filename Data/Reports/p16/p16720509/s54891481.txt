                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke, intubated, febrile  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube present, tip over
 fundus.  A left subclavian central line tip overlies proximal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, similar to prior.  Again seen is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.  This appears improved compared
 with ___ and areas of more confluent opacity at the right lung
 base of improved considerably.  No gross right effusion.  Again seenis
 increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, overall similar to the prior study.  Small left effusion cannot
 be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent CHF, though this appears slightly improved compared with the prior
 study.
 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study.
