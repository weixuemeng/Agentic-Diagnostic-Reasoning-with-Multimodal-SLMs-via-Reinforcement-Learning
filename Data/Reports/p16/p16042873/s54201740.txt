  Very low lung volumes similar to prior. Relative increased opacity of the left
  hemithorax relative to the right may be positional. There is mild prominence
  of the pulmonary vasculature which may relate to low lung volumes and vascular
  crowding but mild interstitial pulmonary edema is possible. Consider follow-up
  CXR. Right PICC in constant position. Trach tube unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with tracheostomy and tachypnea.  Evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 The right-sided PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in position. 
 There are markedly low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular
 markings.  There is likely due to atelectasis at the lung bases.  The left
 lung appears slightly more dense than the right.  This may be due to the low
 lung volumes, however, mild pulmonary edema is possible.  No pneumothoraces
 are identified.
