                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Again seen is a right-sided PICC line, with tip overlying right atrium.A
 tracheostomy tube is in place. 
 
 The overall appearance is similar to ___. There are low inspiratory
 volumes.   There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and of the
 vascular markings, with atelectasis at both bases.  The possibility of an
 acute process is difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes, which could
 contribute to accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular
 markings.
