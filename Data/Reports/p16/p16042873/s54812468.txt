 As compared to the previous image, the endotracheal tube is still located to
 low, with the new 1-2 cm of the carinal, and should be slightly pulled back.
 The patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter, the course of
 the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the mid
 SVC. The patient has also received the nasogastric tube, the course of the
 tube is normal, the tip of the tube is not directly visualized on the image.
 There is unchanged evidence of very low lung volumes and mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema as well as of a likely mild left pleural effusion with a small
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  A platelike atelectasis is also seen paralleling
 the right upper aspect of the mediastinum.  No pneumothorax.
