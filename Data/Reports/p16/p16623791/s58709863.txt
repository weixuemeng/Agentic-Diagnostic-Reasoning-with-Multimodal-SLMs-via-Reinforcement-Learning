                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ngt // ngt location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The right PICC line terminates
 near the superior cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral
 airspace opacities are unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly despite the
 projection is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable bilateral airspace opacities are probably due to pulmonary edema.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 If the exact location of the PICC line tip is in question, a repeat PA and
 lateral radiograph would be helpful.
