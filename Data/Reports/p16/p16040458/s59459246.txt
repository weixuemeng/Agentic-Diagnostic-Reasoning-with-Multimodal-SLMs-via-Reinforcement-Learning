                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic prostate cancer, chills, cough,
 clear lungs on exam // Infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  In view of the larger inspiration, there is
 probably overall little change in the right basilar opacification. Two smaller
 opacities in the left mid lung are likely atelectasis. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Sclerotic bone lesions are again seen in the left humeral head
 and the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right basilar pneumonia does not appear significantly changed.
 2. Multiple foci of metastatic disease are again seen in the bones.
