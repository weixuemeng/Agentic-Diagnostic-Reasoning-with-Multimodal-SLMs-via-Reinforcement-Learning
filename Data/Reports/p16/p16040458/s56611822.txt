                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with prostate cancer  // question of disease
 progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is diffuse sclerosis involving the vertebral bodies, ribs, clavicles
 compatible with metastatic prostate cancer.  The sclerosis appears slightly
 more confluent when compared with the prior study ___, but it is
 difficult to assess disease progression with such widespread metastases by
 chest radiographs.  There are no frank pulmonary lesions.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse bony metastases compatible with metastatic prostate cancer.
 2. Possible slight progression of the existing metastases, but this would be
 better assessed by bone scan or cross-sectional imaging.
 3. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
