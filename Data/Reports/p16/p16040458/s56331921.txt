                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachycardia to 140s and fever to 102.5  //
 new opacity?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, pulmonary vascular congestion and
 edema have nearly resolved.  Patchy and linear foci of atelectasis at the lung
 bases appear similar. No definite new areas of consolidation, but standard PA
 and lateral chest radiographs would provide more complete evaluation of the
 lungs and may be helpful when the patient's condition permits.  Widespread
 sclerotic skeletal metastases are unchanged.
