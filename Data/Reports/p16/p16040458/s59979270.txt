                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The heart is
 normal in size. Streaky opacities at the left lung base suggests minor
 unchanged scarring.  A similar finding is also unchanged in the right
 costophrenic sulcus. Right basilar opacity has continued to decreased as best
 judged on the frontal view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There again widespread sclerotic skeletal bony metastases. Right-sided rib
 deformities appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued decreased in right basilar opacity; otherwise no definite change. 
 Dense skeletal metastases are a background finding which may obscure the lung
 parenchyma, however, to some extent.
