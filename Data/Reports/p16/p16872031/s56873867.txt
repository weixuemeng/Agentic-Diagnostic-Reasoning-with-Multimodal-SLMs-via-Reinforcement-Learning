 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New left-sided chest tube, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left-sided pigtail catheter.  There is a small air collection at the site of
 the tube insertion, but no apical pneumothorax is visible.  The effusion on
 the left is slightly decreased.  The fibrotic changes at the left lung apex,
 obviously the consequence of a healed series of rib fractures, is constant in
 appearance.  Unchanged appearance of the right lung and the cardiac
 silhouette.
