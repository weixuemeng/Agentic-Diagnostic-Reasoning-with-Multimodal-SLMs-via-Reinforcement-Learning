                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 A small right and moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged, associated
 with adjacent atelectasis, left greater than right.  Cardiac size cannot be
 evaluated.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no evident pneumothorax. 
 Multiple left rib fractures, fracture in the left clavicle and degenerative
 changes in the right glenohumeral joint are again visualized.
