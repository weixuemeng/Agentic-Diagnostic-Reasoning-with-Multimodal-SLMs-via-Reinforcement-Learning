                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left shoulder and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right paratracheal
 ovoid calcifications may represent calcified lymph nodes and may be a sequela
 of prior granulomatous disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 mediastinum and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse osteopenia noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Right paratracheal nodular calcifications may represent calcified lymph
 nodes or medial right upper lobe calcified granulomas.
