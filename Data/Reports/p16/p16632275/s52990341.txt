                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with trace pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from outside hospital ___ at 16:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases are
 compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  Previously noted tiny left
 pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the current radiograph.  Minimal
 left pleural effusion is re- demonstrated.  There is residual oral contrast
 material within the stomach.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously seen noted tiny left pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the
 radiograph.  Bibasilar atelectasis and trace left pleural effusion.
