                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal txp now presenting with pancreatitis 
 // Evidence of pleural effusions?      Evidence of pleural effusions?
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of several pleural sulci could be due to small effusions or pleural
 scarring.  There is the suggestion of tiny pleural calcifications along the
 diaphragmatic surface which, if present, would suggest prior asbestos
 exposure.  Lungs are grossly clear.  Nipple shadow should not be mistaken for
 lung nodules.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
