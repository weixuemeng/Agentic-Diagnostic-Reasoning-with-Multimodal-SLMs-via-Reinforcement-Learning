                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of CAD, chest tightness on inspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There are areas of atelectasis at both
 lung bases.  In addition, very subtle reticular opacities are seen, better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  Although the
 costophrenic sinuses are free, the low lung volumes could be suggestive of a
 subtle fibrotic lung process.  CT would be the method of choice to confirm or
 exclude this possibility.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, findings were posted on the
 radiology dashboard.
