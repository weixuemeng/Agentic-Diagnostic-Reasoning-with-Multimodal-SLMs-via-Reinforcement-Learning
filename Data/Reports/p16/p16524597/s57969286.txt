 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Confirm line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left-sided internal jugular vein catheter.  The course of the catheter is
 unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the mid SVC.  No evidence
 of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  In the interval, the right PICC
 line has been removed.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Minimal fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
