                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, history of CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are correlated to CT of the
 abdomen and pelvis from the same day and chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 Mildly indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen, particularly on the
 right.  There is no frank pulmonary edema.  Subtle opacity at the left lung
 base laterally is compatible with scarring identified on prior CT. 
 Costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Numerous fractured mediastinal wires again noted.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are otherwise notable for degenerative changes at the
 acromioclavicular joints.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly indistinct pulmonary vascular markings may be due to
 minimal fluid overload, but no frank evidence of pulmonary edema.
