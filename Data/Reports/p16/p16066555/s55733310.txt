                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with POD3 ventral hernia repair with new onset
 tachycardia and hypoxia  // pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac and mediastinal contours and result in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary opacities are
 more severe in the left lung than the right.  Right hemidiaphragm is
 moderately elevated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube
 terminates in the stomach but side port is at or just above the GE junction
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific heterogeneous lung opacities, which have been more fully
 characterized by subsequently performed and separately dictated CTA of the
 chest from the same date.
