                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded with equivocal mild pulmonary edema. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is somewhat increased from the prior study and could
 reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Marked cardiomegaly is slightly progressed from the
 previous examination.  Single lead ICD is unchanged. Left neck clips could
 reflect prior carotid intervention.
 
 IMPRESSION: Equivocal mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity, most likely
 atelectasis but could reflect infection in the appropriate clinical
 circumstance.
