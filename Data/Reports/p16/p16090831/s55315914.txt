                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with head bleed, intubated at OSH
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen
 terminating approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  Advancement is recommended
 by at least 2-3 cm.  NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. Heart size
 is normal.  The mediastinal contour appears slightly prominent, likely related
 to portable semi supine technique.  Lungs appear clear aside from mild lower
 lung atelectasis.  No acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 High-riding endotracheal tube, please advance by 2-3 cm for more optimal
 positioning.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
