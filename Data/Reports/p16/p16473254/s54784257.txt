                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.5
 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm,
 through the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Lung volumes
 are lower compared to the previous exam. There is moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette. The aorta remains tortuous.  Moderate pulmonary edema is
 new in the interval with small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Moderate pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions with
 probable bibasilar atelectasis.
