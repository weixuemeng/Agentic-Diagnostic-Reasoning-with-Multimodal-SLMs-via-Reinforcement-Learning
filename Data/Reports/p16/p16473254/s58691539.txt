 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary nodules, questionable nodule on radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a minimal parenchymal opacity, located in the left apex, and very likely
 the result of overlying vascular and parenchymal structures.  The structure
 has not grown or changed in morphology.
 
 No other changes.  No pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 structures.
