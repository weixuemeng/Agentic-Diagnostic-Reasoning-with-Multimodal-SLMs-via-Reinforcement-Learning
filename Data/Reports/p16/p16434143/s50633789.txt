                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior congestive heart failure with mild bilateral base crackles and
 ankle edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved
 compared to the prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist, but
 are decreased compared to the prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint is unchanged and likely reflects
 chronic injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved compared prior study with
 persistent but decreased small bilateral pleural effusions.
