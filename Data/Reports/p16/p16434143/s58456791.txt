 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:55 AM
  
  1. Stable left pleural effusion with adjacent left lower lung consolidation,
  likely relaxation atelectasis.
  2. Interval resolution of right pleural effusion.
  3. Stable or minimally improved mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with h/o CHF here with hypoxia and shortness of breath,
 assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, and significant rightward rotation of the patient
 on the current radiograph.  Allowing for changes due to this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is evidence of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, stable or minimally improved in comparison to x-ray from
 ___.  There has been interval resolution of right pleural effusion. 
 The left pleural effusion is again seen, similar to the prior study. 
 Increased opacification of the lower left lung and in the retrocardiac region
 likely relates to relaxation atelectasis, however superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded by radiograph, given the proper clinical setting.  The
 remainder of the lungs are grossly clear without evidence of focal
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  Again seen is postoperative change
 or less likely resorption of the distal left clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small to moderate pleural effusion, quite similar to ___, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Interval resolution of right pleural effusion.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar or slightly improved.
