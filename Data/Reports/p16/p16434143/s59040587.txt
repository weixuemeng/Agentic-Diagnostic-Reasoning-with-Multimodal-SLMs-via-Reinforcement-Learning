                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tremor and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality
 suggestive of mild congestion, but improved since the prior examination. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although it is noted
 that the left lung apex is partly obscured by chin flexion.  Patchy basilar
 opacities have considerably improved, and although there are still probably
 small pleural effusions on each side, these appear smaller.  Mild rightward
 convex curvature is centered at the thoracolumbar junction.  Surgical clips
 project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, with small pleural
 effusions, but considerably improved.
