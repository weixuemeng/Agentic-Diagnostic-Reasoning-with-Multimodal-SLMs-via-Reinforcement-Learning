  1. Left basilar opacity may reflect a combination of pleural effusion and
  atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.
  2. Heterogeneous right basilar opacity may represent atelectasis, aspiration,
  or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sepsis  // stat
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Note is
 made of a large hiatal hernia.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects a
 combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  There is a heterogeneous
 opacity at the right base.  No pneumothorax.  Elliptical opacity with a sharp
 medial margin projects over the right midlung at the level of the seventh
 posterior interspace, probably pleural loculation or focal pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left basilar opacity may reflect a combination of pleural effusion and
 consolidation, although infection is not excluded.
 2. Heterogeneous right basilar opacity may represent atelectasis, aspiration,
 or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3. Focal right pleural thickening, possibly involving major fissure.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Obtain prior chest or right rib radiographs as a first
 step in evaluating right pleural abnormality, in order to exclude a mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   ED QA nurses notified of revision by email.
