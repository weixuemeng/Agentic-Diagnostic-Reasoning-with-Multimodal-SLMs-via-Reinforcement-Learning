                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___; a more
 recent chest CT is available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There are patchy basilar opacities, more extensive on the left than right, and
 fairly similar to the prior radiographs, although these had cleared at the
 time of the CT.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild similar
 rightward convex curvature is centered along the upper thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities, more confluent on the left than
 right.  Noting predominantly streaky character and low lung volumes,
 atelectasis could be considered; in the appropriate clinical setting, however,
 pneumonia would be a possibility.
