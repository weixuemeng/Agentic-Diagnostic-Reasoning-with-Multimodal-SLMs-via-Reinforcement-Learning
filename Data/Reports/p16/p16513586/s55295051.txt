                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Gunshot wound to the chest, left hemithorax after
 chest tube removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is noted, small.  Left pleural effusion is small to
 moderate. Intraperitoneal free air is unchanged since the prior study, most
 likely related to prior surgery.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
