                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea and vomiting and also heard beeping from ICD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings bilaterally, worsened
 since the prior study, may be due to worsening of chronic interstitial lung
 disease or acute on chronic process.  Slight increase in interstitial markings
 at the lateral right upper lung may relate to the above process, although
 atypical infection at this location is not excluded. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  As also noted on the
 prior study, there is subtle background of increased interstitial markings,
 which may be due to chronic lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings bilaterally, worsened
 since the prior study, may be due to worsening of chronic interstitial lung
 disease or acute on chronic process.  Slight increase in interstitial markings
