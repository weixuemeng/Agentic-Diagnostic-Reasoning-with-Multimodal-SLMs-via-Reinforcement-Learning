                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Bronch/TBNA  // eval for ptx, consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since chest radiographs dated ___, the left lung base is less
 well aerated.  A confluent area of opacification in the left lower lobe
 extends superiorly to the level of the hilum.  Shadowing of the left
 hemidiaphragm is likely due to the atelectasis and a small pleural effusion. 
 The heart is normal in size and the pleural surfaces are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left lower lobe atelectasis associated with a small, but increased,
 left pleural effusion.
