                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ w poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma w hilar mass, large
 pleural effusion drained  // Assess pleurex placement and interval change in
 effusion please
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been interval
 placement of a left pleural drainage catheter.  The left pleural effusion
 appears minimally decreased in size with decreased, adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.  There is probably a small right pleural effusion.  The lungs are
 otherwise expanded and clear without focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion decreased in size with associated compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
