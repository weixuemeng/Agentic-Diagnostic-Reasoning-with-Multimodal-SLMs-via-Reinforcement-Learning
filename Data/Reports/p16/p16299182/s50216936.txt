 ADDENDUM:
 
 The complete report of the chest x-ray performed on ___.
 
 In the indication, the text should say pain in the right supraclavicular

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOIGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pain in the left supraclavicular region.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared 1
 cm rounded soft tissue density at the apical aspect of the left hilus.  The
 opacity does in part overlay the anterior margin of the third rib and the
 posterior parts of the sixth rib.  On the lateral radiograph, the structure is
 not identified.
 
 On the lordotic view, performed on ___, the structure is also not
 clearly identified.
 
 Although the structure could theoretically represent a projection artifact,
 the possibility of a small neoplastic lesion should be excluded by CT.
 
 At the time of observation and dictation, 10:14 a.m., ___, the
 finding was added to the radiology dashboard.
