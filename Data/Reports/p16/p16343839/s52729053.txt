                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of renal cell carcinoma,
 evaluate for disease status, rule out pulmonary metastases.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation, but unchanged in
 comparison with the preceding examination.  Unchanged appearance of thoracic
 aorta, no new mediastinal abnormalities are seen.  Right-sided hemithorax
 comparably small in volume related to previous right upper lobectomy with scar
 formations surrounding the apical area.  Pleural scars also blunt the right
 lateral pleural sinus and exist along the right lower lateral chest wall.  In
 the left hemithorax, no pulmonary vascular congestion can be identified.  A
 previously identified 7 mm diameter rounded lesion overlying the second
 anterior intercostal space laterally appears unchanged.  It has not increased
 in size and there are no new additional round lesions that are suggestive for
 pulmonary secondary metastasis in this elderly patient with clinical history
 of renal cell carcinoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no new metastasis-suspected lesions and no
 new signs of CHF or acute pulmonary infections.
