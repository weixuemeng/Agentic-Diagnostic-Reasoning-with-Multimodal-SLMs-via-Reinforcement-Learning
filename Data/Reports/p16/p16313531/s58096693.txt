                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is rotated. 
 Slightly increased retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis although
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 linear atelectasis in the left mid lung.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are
 stable allowing for patient position.  No upper abdominal or osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis although infection
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  If further imaging
 evaluation is needed, a lateral view could be obtained.
