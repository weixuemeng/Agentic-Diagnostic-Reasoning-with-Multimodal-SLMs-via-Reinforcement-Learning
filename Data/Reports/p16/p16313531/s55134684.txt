                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours with persistent
 silhouetting of left heart border due to a large left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left mid and lower lung
 region.  On the right, there is apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 with lateral peaking suggesting the presence of a subpulmonic pleural
 effusion.  Areas of adjacent atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung have
 slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.
 
 2.  Possible subpulmonic component of right pleural effusion.
