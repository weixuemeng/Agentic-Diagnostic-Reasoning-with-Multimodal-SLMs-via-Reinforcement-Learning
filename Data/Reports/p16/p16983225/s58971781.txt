                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Systolic CHF with cirrhosis and rare bibasilar rales.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs with a
 small right pleural effusion.  The left ventricular contour is mildly
 prominent but otherwise, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 lung volumes are slightly low, accentuating the cardiac contour and pulmonary
 vasculature.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal right pleural effusion with no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
