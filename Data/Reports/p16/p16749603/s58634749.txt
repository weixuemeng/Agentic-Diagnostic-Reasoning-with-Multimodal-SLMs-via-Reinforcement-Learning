                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed.  Patient has taken a better inspiration.  There is residual left
 pleural effusion with basilar atelectatic change and probable substantial
 hiatal hernia.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  
 
 Opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region is consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
