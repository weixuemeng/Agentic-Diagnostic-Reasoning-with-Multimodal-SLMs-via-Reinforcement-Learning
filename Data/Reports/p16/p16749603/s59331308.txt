                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is new increased retrocardiac atelectasis and a developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, large hiatal hernia remains stable. 
 The right hemithorax is clear.  Recently noted nodular opacities in the left
 upper lobe are better visualized on dedicated chest CT from ___.  No acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in the left lower lobe is likely suggestive of
 atelectasis.  However, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Large
 hiatal hernia persists.
