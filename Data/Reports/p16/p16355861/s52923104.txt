                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with progressive sob  // eval for pulmonary edema, other
 cardiopulmonary pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left basilar opacity likely due to a combination of moderate
 pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. Blunting of the lateral and
 posterior costophrenic angles on the right suggests small effusion. These
 changes have increased since prior exam. Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 again noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Mitral annular
 calcifications are again noted. Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is
 again noted. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis noting infection
 would also be possible. Pulmonary vascular congestion and probable small right
 pleural effusion as well.
