                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  SOB; ? PLEURAL EFFUSION
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the basis with blunting of the costophrenic angles,
 consistent with bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, an
 underlying compressive atelectasis. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The dual -channel pacer
 leads are unchanged.
 Impression on the lower cervical trachea on the left suggests enlarged thyroid
 gland. Dedicated thyroid ultrasound could be obtained.
