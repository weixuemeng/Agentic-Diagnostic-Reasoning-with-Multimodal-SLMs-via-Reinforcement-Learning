 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:07 AM
  Compared with the prior radiograph, there are increased interstitial lung
  markings in the upper and midlung fields, and worse in the bilateral lower
  lungs, which may be due to atypical pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 1:04 AM
  Compared with the prior radiograph, there are increased interstitial lung
  markings and an unchanged subtle opacity at the right lung base.  This was
  previously described as atelectasis, scarring, or focal consolidation.  In the
  correct clinical setting, this may be infectious.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hemoptysis.  Evidence of infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widespread bony metastases from prostate cancer limits evaluation.  Diffuse
 interstitial pattern predominantly in the upper and mid lung fields, an worse
 in the bilateral lower lungs, may be due to atypical pneumonia or pulmonary
 hemorrhage, given no new heart enlargement suggesting failure. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No large pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread interstitial abnormalities, concerning for atypical pneumonia or
 hemorrhage in the setting of hemoptysis.  If warranted clinically, further
 evaluation by chest CT may be considered for more complete characterization of
 these findings.
