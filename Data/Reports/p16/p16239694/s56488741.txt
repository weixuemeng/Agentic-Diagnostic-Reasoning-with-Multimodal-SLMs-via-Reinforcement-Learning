                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:59 hours.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Nasogastric tube has been advanced, though the tip remains at the distal
 esophagus.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are again identified, as seen on
 prior study, now layering dependently.  There is associated basilar
 atelectasis, without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature appears minimally engorged, though edema
 has decreased from prior study.  Dilated viscus is noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Malpositioned NG tube, requires advancement for optimal positioning.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
 
 3.  Resolved pulmonary edema.
