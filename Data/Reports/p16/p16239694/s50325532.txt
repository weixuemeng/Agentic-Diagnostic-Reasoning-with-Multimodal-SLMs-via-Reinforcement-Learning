 The lung volumes are low, and there are bilateral hazy opacities in the lung
 bases, suggestive of a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  There
 is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, with mild pulmonary edema.  Heart
 size is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax, and there is no focal opacity to
 suggest pneumonia.
