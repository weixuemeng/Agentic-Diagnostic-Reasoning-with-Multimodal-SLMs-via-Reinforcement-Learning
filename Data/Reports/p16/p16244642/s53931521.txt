  An endotracheal tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  An enteric tube
  courses off the inferior aspect of the film.  Right IJ line ends in the mid
  SVC.  Cardiac conduction device is contiguous with a single lead which appears
  to terminate in the right ventricle.  Bilateral airspace opacities, worse of
  the lung bases and small pleural effusions are unchanged from multiple prior
  studies.  Cardiomegaly is mild.
