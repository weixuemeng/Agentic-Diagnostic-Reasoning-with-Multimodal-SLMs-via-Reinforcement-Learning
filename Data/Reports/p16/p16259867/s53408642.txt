 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Subtly seen is an enteric catheter, not well
 assessed on the current study but with a linear radiopaque structure seen
 below the level of the diaphragm, in the expected location of the stomach.
