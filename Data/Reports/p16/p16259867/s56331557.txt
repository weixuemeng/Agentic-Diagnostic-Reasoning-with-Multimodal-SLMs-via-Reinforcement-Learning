                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a nasogastric tube that coils within the upper stomach, so that
 the tip points upward just below the level of the esophagogastric junction.
 
 Extensive atelectatic changes are seen in the left mid and lower lung.
