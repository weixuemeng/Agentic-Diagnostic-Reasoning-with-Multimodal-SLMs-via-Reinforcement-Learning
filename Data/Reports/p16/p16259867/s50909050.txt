                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:30 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, new hypoxia.  Suspect
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Generalized bronchial cuffing is still present.  Although this can be an
 indication of pulmonary edema, there are no ancillary findings, specifically
 the heart is normal size, mediastinal veins not dilated, pulmonary vessels not
 engorged, and there is no pleural effusion.  I would attribute the bronchial
 findings to diffuse bronchial inflammation, including asthma.  Right skinfolds
 should not be mistaken for pneumothorax.  Dialysis catheter ends in the upper
 right atrium.
