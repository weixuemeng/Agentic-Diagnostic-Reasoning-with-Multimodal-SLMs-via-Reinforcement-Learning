                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M complicated medical history (h/o DVT/PE,
 CMML/myelodysplastic syndrome, s/p TAC/ileostomy s/p reversal in setting of
 ulcerative colitis vs c diff, nephrolithiasis s/p stenting, PAD s/p R BKA due
 to chronic ulcer, and multiple recent prolonged hospitalizations at ___
 ___ sepsis who presented as transfer from ___ to ___ MICU on ___ for
 septic shock, SBO, and multifocal pneumonia requiring intubation s/p pressor
 therapy, IV antibiotics with hospital course complicated by thrombocytopenia,
 ongoing leukocytosis ___ MPN, sacral decubitus ulcer s/p debridement,
 persistent fevers, adrenal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the patchy opacity previously seen left mid zone
 is slightly improved.  Retrocardiac opacity, obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 and small left effusion are similar.  The left pleural effusion could be
 slightly decreased in the interval.
 
 There is prominent vascular plethora presumably reflecting CHF, though the
 appearance raises the possibility of some background parenchymal scarring.
 
 Small focal, peripheral, patchy opacities at the right base laterally are
 noted, similar prior.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 consistent with a small right effusion.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Again seen is a left PICC line, with tip overlying the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left
 effusion, though previously seen left mid zone patchy opacity is improved.
 
 Probable CHF, which appears slightly worse.  Question background parenchymal
 scarring.
 
 Small focal peripheral opacities at the right lung base, of uncertain etiology
 or significance, but unchanged compared with the prior film.  These likely
 correspond to findings on the chest CT from ___.  They presumably
 represent some form of infectious infiltrate.  Peripheral location is
 suggestive of an embolic phenomenon such as septic emboli.
