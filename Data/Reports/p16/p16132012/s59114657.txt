                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, septic shock, SBO,
 multifocal pneumonia  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:
 None available
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position.  Left
 internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the distal left
 brachiocephalic vein just proximal to the confluence with the superior vena
 cava.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary opacities probably
 reflect a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
