                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ ___ and abdominal CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Enlargement
 of central pulmonary arteries is suggestive of pulmonaryhypertension in this
 patient with chronic interstitial fibrosis.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 persists, with adjacent opacity (atelectasis, consolidation or contusion) in
 the right lower lobe, as well as multiple right-sided rib fractures.  There is
 no visible pneumothorax.
