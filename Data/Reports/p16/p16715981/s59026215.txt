                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change in this patient with rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, CT chest ___.
 CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Multiple right lateral rib fractures are better assessed on the
 chest CT from ___.  New right lateral basilar opacity adjacent to
 the rib fractures may represent a pulmonary contusion.  Medial right basilar
 opacity appears more consolidated than on the most recent prior study but may
 still represent pulmonary vasculature. There is also increased right basilar
 atelectasis and likely a small right pleural effusion. There is no
 pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. Compared with most recent prior chest
 radiograph from ___, there has been improvement in the interstitial edema,
 but underlying bilateral interstitial abnormality, more pronounced in the
 periphery, remains.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Note is
 made of air filled prominent bowel loops, partly imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Developing lateral right basilar opacity adjacent to multiple rib fractures
 concerning for pulmonary contusion. Pneumonia is also possible in the correct
 clinical setting.
 2. Mild interstitial edema has resolved, with likely chronic interstitial
 abnormality remaining.
 3. Air filled dilated bowel, partly imaged. Clinical correlation is
 recommended to determine the need for further imaging.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ item 1 in the Impression with Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at approximately 1 PM. Also, Dr. ___ discussed with Dr. ___ ___
 finding of a concerning liver lesion on the CT abdomen pelvis on ___
 from___ for which a MRI for further evaluation was recommended on
 the outside hospital report. Please note that the report for this CT abdomen
 pelvis is not available in Careweb at this time. Dr. ___ ___ a CT
 technician at___ regarding this issue on ___ at
 approximately 12:30pm, and it is being resolved.
