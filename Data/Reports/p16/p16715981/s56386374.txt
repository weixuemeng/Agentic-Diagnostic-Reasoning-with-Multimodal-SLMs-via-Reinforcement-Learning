                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall with rib fractures.  Evaluate
 for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and plain film from outside institution performed two
 hours prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities, more pronounced
 in the lung bases, worsened from recent film from outside institution.
 Baseline interstitial lung disease and emphysema are better assessed in prior
 CT.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is present and of unknown
 chronicity. Fractures of the lateral aspect of the right ribs five through
 nine are better assessed in recent CT. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  A small right-sided pleural effusion is present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Compared with recent radiograph there is interval development of
 interstitial edema on underlying extensive interstitial lung disease and
 emphysema.
 
 2.  Rib fractures through the right lateral ribs five through nine.
 
 3.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity.  A small
 right-sided pleural effusion is present.
