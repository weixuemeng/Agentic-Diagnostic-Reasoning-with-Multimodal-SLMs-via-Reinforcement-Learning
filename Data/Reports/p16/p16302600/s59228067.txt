                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available. Correlation is made to CT thoracic
 spine from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded.  Streaky linear
 opacities in the left lung base are most compatible with atelectasis or
 pleural parenchymal scarring.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is
 midline.
 
 An ovoid calcified density projects over the left upper abdomen measuring 5.2
 x 3.4 cm in size, which is compatible with peripherally calcified left renal
 structure which has not yet been fully characterized
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  5.2 x 3.7 cm peripherally calcified density in the left upper abdomen
 within the left kidney seen on prior CT T spine which has never been fully
 characterized at this institution.  Nonurgent multiphasic MR abdomen or
 alternatively CT should be done if not already performed.
 
 Findings were emailed by Dr. ___ to the ___ ___ nurses on ___ to arrange
 for followup as findings were discovered following the patient's discharge.
