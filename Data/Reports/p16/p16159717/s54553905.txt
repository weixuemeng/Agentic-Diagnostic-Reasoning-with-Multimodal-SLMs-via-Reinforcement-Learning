                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 Lungs are well aerated. There is no clear consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax, but there is a very slight increase in radiodensity of the right
 lower lung just above the diaphragm compared to the left. It would be very
 useful to obtain conventional radiographs, particularly the lateral view to
 re-evaluate this area. .  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there is no clear, acute cardiopulmonary abnormality I would
 recommend repeat conventional chest radiographs to re-evaluate the right lower
 lobe.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to the MICU Green resident by
 telephone on ___ at 9:53 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although there is no clear, acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality I would recommend repeat conventional chest radiographs to
 re-evaluate the right lower lobe.
