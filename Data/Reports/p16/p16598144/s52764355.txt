                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 Right upper quadrant pain. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest .  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits for age.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion. Again seen is a rounded opacity overlying the left eighth
 rib, unchanged from prior radiograph and likely representing a calcified
 granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to confirm the presence of a
 pneumonic infiltrate.
