                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  History of interstitial lung
 disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest again seen are diffusely increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs with a basilar predominance. 
 Relatively low lung volumes are seen.  These changes make evaluation for
 subtle changes difficult however there may be a new consolidation in the left
 midlung.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible with patient's known
 interstitial lung disease which makes detailed evaluation by plain films
 limited.  Possible new region of consolidation in the left midlung which could
 represent a superimposed acute process such as infection.
