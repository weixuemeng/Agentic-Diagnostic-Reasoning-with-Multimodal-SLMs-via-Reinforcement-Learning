                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, question pneumonia or
 fluid overload.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors.  
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Patient's kyphotic positioning causes the chin to obscure the lung
 apices.  Diffuse interstitial opacity with a basilar predominance raises
 concern for pulmonary fibrosis. Heart size is difficult to accurately assess. 
 The mediastinal contour appears unremarkable.  No large pneumothorax. Bony
 structures appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Basilar predominant interstitial opacity concerning for pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Recommend correlation with prior imaging if available to confirm. 
 If no prior studies are available, consider high-resolution CT of the chest to
 further evaluate.
