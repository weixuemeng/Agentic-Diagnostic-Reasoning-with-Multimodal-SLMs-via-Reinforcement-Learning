 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been significant interval increase in prominence of the
 interstitial markings diffusely, with most dense in the bilateral lung bases
 and right upper lobe worrisome for worsening of chronic interstitial disease
 with superimposed acute component of infection/inflammation.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  The aorta is calcified.
