                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:   The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Lung volumes are low.  A right perihilar rounded opacity appears
 new and may represent lymphadenopathy, although an osseous lesion or a lung
 lesion cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 Patchy demineralization of the left humerus head is compatible with metastatic
 disease, correlating with abnormalities seen on the prior PET-CT.  The patient
 is status post gastric banding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right perihilar rounded opacity appears new and may represent
 lymphadenopathy.  An osseous or lung lesion cannot be excluded.  Non-emergent
 chest CT may be obtained for further evaluation.
 2.  Patchy left humerus head demineralization, compatible with metastatic
 disease seen on prior PET-CT.
