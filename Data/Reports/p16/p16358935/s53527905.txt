                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, abdominal pain, history of
 metastatic cervical cancer, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits the evaluation.  Crowding of bronchovasculature at the lung
 bases likely accounts for the relative increased opacity.  The overall
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  In this patient with
 known bony metastatic disease, evaluation is limited on this chest radiograph.
