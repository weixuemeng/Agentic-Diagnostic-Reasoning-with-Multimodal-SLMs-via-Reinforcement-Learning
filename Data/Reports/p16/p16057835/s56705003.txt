                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History shortness-of-breath.  Please evaluate for COPD /infiltrate. 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low and the patient's chin overlies the medial lung
 apices, obscuring the view.  New opacities are seen overlying the mid to upper
 left lung.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases bilaterally are likely
 secondary to atelectasis.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is persistent.  Aorta
 is tortuous and calcified, however the hilar and mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  Persistent blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles
 which coudl be due to persistent trace effusions.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New left lung opacities are concerning for pneumonia.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis, however an acute infectious
 process cannot be excluded at those locations as well.
