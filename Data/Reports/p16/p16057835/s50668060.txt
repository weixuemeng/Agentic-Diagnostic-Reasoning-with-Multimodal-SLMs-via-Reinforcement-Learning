                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and colitis with worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased opacification asymmetrically in the left lung is likely
 pulmonary edema given vascular engorgement and septal lines. Left greater than
 right basal opacities suggest atelectasis. Bilateral dependent pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  Right PICC terminates likely at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely asymmetric pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis and
 trace effusions; however close clinical followup is recommended to assess for
 obscured developing pneumonia.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by
 phone.
