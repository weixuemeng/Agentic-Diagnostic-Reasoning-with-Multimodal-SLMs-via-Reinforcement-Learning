                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sepsis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacities in the retrocardiac region and at
 the bilateral bases are most suggestive of atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs
 are clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The osseous structures are notable for
 two vertebroplasties in the mid thoracic spine.  Surgical clips are identified
 in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis,
 noting that component of infection cannot be entirely excluded.
