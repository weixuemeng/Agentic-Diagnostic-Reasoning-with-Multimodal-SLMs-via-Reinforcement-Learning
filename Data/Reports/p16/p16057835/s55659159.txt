 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, COPD and, abdominal pain and copious diarrhea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar with aortic knob calcifications again demonstrated.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are worse
 in the interval, and could reflect atelectasis or infection.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Kyphosis of the mid thoracic spine with
 evidence of prior kyphoplasty of 2 adjacent compression fractures in the mid
 thoracic spine is re- demonstrated.  Clips are noted in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect worsening atelectasis or infection.
