                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous opacities in the left upper lobe have progressed in
 the interval and are now accompanied by confluent airspace opacities in the
 left perihilar region.  Heart remains enlarged, and there is also marked
 enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries, likely due to pulmonary
 hypertension in the setting of severe upper lobe predominant emphysema. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also present and may have
 increased in the interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening left upper lobe and juxta-hilar opacities, concerning
 for evolving infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
