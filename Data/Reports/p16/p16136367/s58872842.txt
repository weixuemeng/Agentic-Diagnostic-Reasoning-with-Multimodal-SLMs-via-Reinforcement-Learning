                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of breast cancer, now with fever and cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the tip seen terminating
 within the lower SVC.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema is seen.  There is an 8 mm rounded structure projecting
 over the right upper lung with sharp margins, and may be external to the
 patient. The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2. 8 mm rounded structure projecting over the right upper lung. Findings are
 new since the prior exam, and the structure is sharply marginated, suggestive
 of a structure external to the patient.
