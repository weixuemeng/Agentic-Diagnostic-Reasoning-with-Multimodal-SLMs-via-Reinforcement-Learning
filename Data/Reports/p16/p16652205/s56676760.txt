                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tachypnea and fever.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Right lower lobe consolidation appears to be even more pronounced than on the
 prior study, associated with pleural effusion and potentially may reflect
 infectious process.  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
