                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  
 
 
 An endotracheal tube has been placed with the distal tip approximately 5.9 cm
 from the carina in satisfactory placement.  A nasogastric tube is also noted
 which extends off the inferior edge of the radiograph projecting over the left
 upper quadrant.  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles likely indicates
 small effusions.  No definite consolidation or superimposed edema is noted. 
 There is aortic tortuosity.  There is prominence of the bilateral hila
 presumably due to enlarged pulmonary arteries.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged but stable.  No pneumothorax is evident.  There are no displaced
 fractures.  Fracture deformity of the anterior right fifth rib likely reflects
 remote healed trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  No definite acute pulmonary process identified. 
 There is suggestion of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Endotracheal tube
 in satisfactory position.
