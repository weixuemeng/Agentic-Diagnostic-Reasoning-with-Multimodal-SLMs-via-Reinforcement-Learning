                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:49 P.M, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Question new aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:59 a.m.:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger now than earlier in the day, but
 there is no other change.  Right lung base is essentially obscured by the
 elevated hemidiaphragm and overlying effusion, probably substantially
 atelectatic.  Heart is severely enlarged.  Upper lungs are grossly clear and
 there is no left pleural effusion.  Left subclavian line ends at the junction
 of brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax.  Thoracic aorta is very tortuous
 and generally large but probably not focally aneurysmal.
