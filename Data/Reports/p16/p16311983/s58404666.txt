                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with leukocytosis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the left
 hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen.  This suggests some atelectatic change
 and possible pleural effusion at the left base.  Otherwise, little change.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to rule out the
 possibility of retrocardiac consolidation.
