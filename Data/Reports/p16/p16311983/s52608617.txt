                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluation for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph from ___,
 dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the
 lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, with mild right basilar atelecatasis and
 peribronchial wall thickening of the right lower lobe airways.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged, stable compared to prior studies.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema is detected. Coarse
 interstitial markings are unchanged compared to prior studies.  Multiple
 right-sided rib deformities are unchanged.  A dual-lead pacemaker device is in
 stable position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Peribronchial infiltrate in the right
 lung base is likely due to underlying bronchiectasis or bronchitis, however an
 oblique or lateral view is recommended for better characterization.
