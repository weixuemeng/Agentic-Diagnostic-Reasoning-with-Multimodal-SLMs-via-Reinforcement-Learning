                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, in a patient with smoke inhalation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with the
 tip terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.  A left chest wall pacing device
 is unchanged in position, with the leads terminating over the right atrium and
 ventricle.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior
 edge of the image.
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Even allowing for this, increased
 opacity bilaterally is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, although a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 Right posterior ribs, bilateral clavicular and proximal right humerus
 fractures are chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. Bilateral opacities likely represent moderate pulmonary edema, although a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
