                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP); CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p pacemaker extraction and implantation of a
 new VVI pacemaker via L subclavian. Eval for PTX // ___ year old man s/p
 pacemaker extraction and implantation of a new VVI pacemaker via L subclavian.
 Eval for PTX ; ___ year old man s/p pacemaker extraction and implantation of a
 new VVI pacemaker via L subclavian. // ___ year old man s/p pacemaker
 extraction and implantation of a new VVI pacemaker via L subclavian. Eval for
 PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ___ radiograph shows a single lead from a left pectoral pacemaker
 projecting over the right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax. A right PICC
 line terminates in the upper right atrium near the cavoatrial junction. 
 Withdrawal by 1-2 cm would position its tip at the cavoatrial junction if
 desired.  Mild pulmonary edema has slightly increased.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 despite the projection is unchanged.  A small left pleural effusion is likely
 present.  Increased retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due to
 atelectasis or infection.  Previous cervical spine fusion is partially imaged.
 
 The followup PA and lateral radiographs from ___ confirm a left lower
 lobe airspace opacity, which is most likely due to pneumonia.  There is also
 increased mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left pectoral pacemaker with single lead projecting over the right
 ventricle.
 No pneumothorax.
 New left lower lobe pneumonia.
 Increase mild pulmonary edema.
 Right PICC line tip approximately 2 cm below the estimated location of the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:26 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
