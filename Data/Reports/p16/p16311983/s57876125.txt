                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___ and ___, there is again
 some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with prominence of interstitial
 markings.  Although some of this could reflect chronic interstitial lung
 disease, the possibility of superimposed acute pulmonary vascular congestion
 would certainly have to be considered.  An area of asymmetric opacification at
 the right base raises the possibility of consolidation in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Dual-channel pacer device is in place with leads extending to the right atrium
 and apex of the right ventricle.  Of incidental note are at least 2 probable
 old healed rib fractures in the mid-to-lower right area.
