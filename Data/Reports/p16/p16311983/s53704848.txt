                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hyponatremia and mental status change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A coarse interstitial abnormality appears unchanged with no new
 focal opacification.  
 
 Right-sided rib deformities are unchanged as well as a prior fracture of the
 proximal right humerus with remodeling.  There was also non-united right
 clavicle fracture.  A mild lower thoracic anterior wedge compression deformity
 appears stable.  The lateral view also partly depicts the cervical spine where
 there is slight spondylolisthesis of C2 on C3 and mild kyphotic angulation
 above the site of prior anterior fusion spanning the C5 through C7 levels. 
 Although there is no clear evidence for change, cervical spine findings are
 not optimally assessed on these images.  Bony findings appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
