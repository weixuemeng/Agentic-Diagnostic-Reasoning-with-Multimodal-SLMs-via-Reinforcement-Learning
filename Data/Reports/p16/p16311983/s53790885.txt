                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary edema and PNA  // interval change
 in volume overload and PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  APsingle view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lines and Tubes: Left sided pacemaker with a single pacer wires remains
 unchanged.  Right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Lungs: Persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar opacities, with mild interval
 worsening compared to the prior radiograph.
 
 Pleura: There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 
 Mediastinum: Stable appearance of mild to moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.
 
 Bony thorax: No interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes with no interval change in bibasilar opacities,
 compatible with atelectasis versus pneumonia.
