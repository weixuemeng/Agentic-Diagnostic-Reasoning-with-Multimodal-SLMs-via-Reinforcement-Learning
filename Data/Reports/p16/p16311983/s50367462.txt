                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  A
 right-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Single lead
 pacemaker/ICD device terminates in the right ventricle.  Retrocardiac
 opacification has mildly improved but pulmonary edema appears not
 significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent pulmonary edema.  Improvement in left basilar opacification,
 probably improvement in atelectasis associated with a pleural effusion.
