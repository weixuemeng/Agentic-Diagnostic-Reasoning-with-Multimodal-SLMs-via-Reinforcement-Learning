                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, here to evaluate for fluid overload or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval increased mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion/interstitial edema from the remote prior study.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions on the right greater than left are present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild biapical scarring appears symmetrical.  Increased
 opacification at the right lung base is most likely reflective of atelectasis.
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable.  The mediastinum is
 prominent, likely related to a combination of tortuous vessels and technique. 
 Anterior cervical spine fixation hardware is redemonstrated.  There are
 multiple old fracture deformities of the bilateral clavicles and right
 posterior ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
