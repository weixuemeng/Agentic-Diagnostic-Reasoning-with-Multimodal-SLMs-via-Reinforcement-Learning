                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with diastolic congestive
 heart failure, decompensated.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Widespread parenchymal opacities
 giving the perihilar centering are most likely consistent with pulmonary edema
 that appears to be minimally improved since the prior study.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is small amount of pleural effusion.  No evidence of new
 consolidation is demonstrated to suggest interval development of infectious
 process.
