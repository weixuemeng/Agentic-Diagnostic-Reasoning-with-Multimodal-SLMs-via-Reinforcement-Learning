                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/o weakness with fever/chills  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacer device is stable in position. The cardiac
 silhouette remains top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable. There has been significant interval decrease in previously seen
 pulmonary opacities. Minimal vascular congestion may persist. Subtle right
 basilar opacity more likely relates overlap of vascular structures rather than
 focal consolidation.
