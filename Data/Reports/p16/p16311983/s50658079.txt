                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of seizure, pneumonia.  Please evaluate for interval
 change compared to the prior exam.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___; most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Inreased intersitial marking
 throughout the lungs are unchanged compared to priors.  There is persistent
 left base opacity.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unchanged with chronic posterior right rib fractures,
 right clavicular fracture and anterior cervicothoracic spine fixation
 hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Persistent opacification at the left lung base may be secondary to
 aspiration/infection.
