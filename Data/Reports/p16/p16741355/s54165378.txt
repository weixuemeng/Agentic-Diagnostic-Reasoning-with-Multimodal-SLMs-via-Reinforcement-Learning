                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of CyberKnife surgery,
 now with increasing shortness of breath.  Decreased breath sounds on left
 side.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but remains
 unchanged in comparison with the next preceding study.  The same holds for the
 thoracic aorta, which is of normal ___ but shows some calcium deposits
 in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Presence of surgical fiducial marks are again recognized and
 located to the left hemithorax in suprahilar as well as peripheral left lower
 lobe position.  Their positions are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature shows
 irregular peripheral distribution, which in conjunction with the relatively
 low positioned and flattened diaphragms, is indicative of COPD.  There exists
 a left-sided infrahilar density, which apparently represents patient's known
 pulmonary malignancy.  Its size has not undergone any significant alteration
 since ___.  Careful comparison of the chest findings does not
 demonstrate evidence of increased pulmonary vascular congestion or
 manifestations of pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical
 area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No interval change since next preceding
 study.
