                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatitis, respiratory insufficiency, followup.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 3:51 a.m.
 
  
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off the film.  A right
 IJ central line is present, tip overlying SVC/RA junction or upper right
 atrium.  A line is seen overlying the right scapula outside the right chest
 wall, stable compared with exams from ___ and ___ -- ? PICC line that lies
 outside the chest wall.  Skin ___ noted over the upper abdomen.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. Probable mild cardiomegaly. 
  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  There is increased retrocardiac density, with air bronchograms,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect a small left effusion. 
 Some patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic region is compatible with either
 atelectasis or a focal area of consolidation. 
 
 Compared with one day earlier, the lung volumes are slightly expanded and the
 degree of opacification in both lungs has decreased, suggesting interval
 improvement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Note made of PICC line, tip overlying the right scapula, outside the chest
 wall. 
 2) Probable slight interval improvement, though bilateral pulmonary
 opacification persists.
