                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sob  // please assess for acute process   
 please assess for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 457
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 09:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain relatively low. There is increasing perihilar and airspace
 opacities throughout both lungs with relative sparing of the right upper lung.
 Given the interval change, this would favor mild to moderate pulmonary edema
 rather than an acute infectious process.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line
 are unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip not identified.  No pneumothorax.
