                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart transplant and hypoxia  // Evidence of
 improved pulmonary edema. Evaluating utility of VQ scan.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 08:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, no definite interval change.  Again seen is
 marked prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, with sternotomy wires
 and additional radiopacity overlying the right cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 unchanged.  Although vessels and lung markings appear prominent, this is
 likely accentuated by  overlying soft tissues and underpenetration.  Possible
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
