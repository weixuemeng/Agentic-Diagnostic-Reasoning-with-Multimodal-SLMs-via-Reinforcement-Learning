 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is prominence of the
 interstitial markings bilaterally, increased as compared to the prior study
 suggesting interstitial edema less likely atypical infection.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, with suggestion of mild interstitial edema.
