                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever  // fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest wall pulse generator with continuous pacemaker leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged in position.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance.  Lung volumes are low,
 and left lower lobe opacity is more conspicuous compared to the most recent
 comparison studies from ___.  Mild prominent interstitial markings
 persist, possibly due to underlying chronic interstitial lung disease, with
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left lower lobe opacity, compatible with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting, with superimposed mild pulmonary edema. Followup
 radiographic evaluation after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.
