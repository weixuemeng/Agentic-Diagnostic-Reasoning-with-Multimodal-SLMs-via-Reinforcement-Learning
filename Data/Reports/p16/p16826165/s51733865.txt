                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with intermittent shortness of breath,
 assess interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest show interval reduction of lung
 volumes with increased bilateral perihilar opacities, compatible with
 increased pulmonary edema.  Lung base opacities are increased, likely due to
 atelectasis, which is accentuated by low lung volumes.  Heart size is not
 assessable because it is obscured by the low lung volumes.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
