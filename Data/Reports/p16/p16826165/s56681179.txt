 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with history of COPD, congestive heart
 failure, status post CCY cholecystectomy with new oxygen requirement and
 dyspnea.  Assess for fluid overload or congestive heart failure exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest shows reduced lung volume with
 increased perihilar opacity likely due to vascular congestion.  New bibasilar
 opacity might be due to aspiration especially in ligth of recent abdominal
 surgery.  There is now blunting of the left costophrenic angle due to small
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is still mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion, left pleural effusion and probable
 aspiration
