                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  In addition to moderate pleural
 thickening at each lung apex, with patchy suspected calcification, along the
 lateral right lung apex, but also overlapping with the course of the right
 anterior lateral third rib, there is a nodular focus of about 1 cm.  Mid
 thoracic interspaces are mildly narrowed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Opacity at the right lung apex for which differential considerations
 include focal pleural thickening, a prior ribs injury but potentially a
 pulmonary nodule including the possibility of malignancy.
 
 When clinically appropriate chest CT evaluation is recommended.  Findings
 discussed with Dr. ___ at 16:00 by telephone while the patient was still in
 the emergency department.
