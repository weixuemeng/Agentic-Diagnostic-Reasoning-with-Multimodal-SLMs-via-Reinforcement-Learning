                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, on
 GM-CSF therapy, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination ___ ___.  Normal heart size, mediastinal
 structures, and thoracic aorta unaltered.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  The previously identified bilateral diffuse small nodular
 densities predominantly present in the mid lung fields persist.  Comparison of
 the chest examinations in both frontal and lateral views gives the clear
 subjective impression of regression.  The improvement appears to be somewhat
 more marked on the left side than on the right.  No new pulmonary discrete
 infiltrates can be identified, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 remain free.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of the on previous examinations identified fine
 nodular pattern consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  As patient's
 previous records including multiple CT chest examinations which also over time
 demonstrated improvement, it may be considered to perform an additional CT
 scan to confirm the recent improvement more objectively.
