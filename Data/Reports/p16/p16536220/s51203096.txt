                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  History of cirrhosis and alveolar proteinosis, presenting with
 malaise and orthostasis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___; a chest CT is
 also available from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There are vague right mid lung opacities, which are for the most part fairly
 similar to the prior study, although with an increase in the left suprahilar
 region.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are mild
 degenerative changes along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left suprahilar opacity, which would be compatible with
 alveolar proteinosis, although not specific.
