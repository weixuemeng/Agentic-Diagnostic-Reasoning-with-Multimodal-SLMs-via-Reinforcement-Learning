                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Patient with history of pulmonary alveolar
 proteinosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 As compared to prior chest radiographs, there is interval decrease in the
 extent of ground-glass opacities, in particular in the right upper and lower
 lobe, but also in the left lung, consistent with radiological improvement. 
 Still present left upper lobe, right lower lobe opacities are noted and most
 likely reflect similar process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall substantial improvement of the radiographic findings including
 bilateral opacities within the limitations of this study technique.
