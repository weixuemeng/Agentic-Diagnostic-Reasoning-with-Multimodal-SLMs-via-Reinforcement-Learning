                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ST elevation MI.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is a perihilar distribution of parenchymal opacities. 
 Left-sided pleural effusion is seen tracking laterally.  There is also subtle
 blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle as well.  Cardiac silhouette
 is enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the arch.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  Calcification in the left
 upper quadrant of the splenic artery.  IV line projects over the left neck as
 well as a surgical clip.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema, although clinical
 correlation is suggested to exclude possible pneumonia.
