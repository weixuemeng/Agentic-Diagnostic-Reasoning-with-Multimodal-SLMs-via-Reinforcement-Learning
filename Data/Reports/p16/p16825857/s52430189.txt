                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with congestive heart failure, severe CAD, status post
 MI, now presents with hemoptysis.  Please evaluate for pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs with dates
 ranging from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable mild
 cardiomegaly and bilateral hilar prominence.  New significantly increased
 bibasilar consolidations are evident, left greater than right, which may
 represent bilateral pleural effusions with an element of lobar collapse on the
 left, although there is not the expected secondary findings of signficant
 volume loss.   No pneumothorax evident.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and
 intact.  Stable splenic artery calcifications identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Substantial increase in bibasilar consolidations may reflect combination
 of effusions and atelectasis.  However, given rapidity of change, there is a
 possibility of lobar collapse on the left.  Recommend repeat imaging with
 lateral view if possible to help differentiate between collapse and effusion.
