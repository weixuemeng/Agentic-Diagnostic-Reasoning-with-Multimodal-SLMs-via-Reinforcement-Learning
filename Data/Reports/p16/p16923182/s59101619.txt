                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with post-extubation hypertension. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax or acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-
 recumbent position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier
 during the same day.  The previously present NG tube has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax can be identified.  Noted, however, are markedly increased
 densities predominantly overlying the lung bases, but reaching higher now on
 this portable chest examination.  One explanation could be that the previously
 present pleural effusions are layering higher up as the patient is in more
 supine position.  Evidence of bilateral basal atelectasis as before.  If
 quantification of pleural effusion is essential for future management, an
 additional lateral view could be of value.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The patient extubated and NG tube removed.  Increasing basal
 densities are worrisome for increased pleural effusion, but could be related
 to patient's different position and poor inspirational effort.  Telephone was
 placed to referring physician, ___ at 2:___ p.m.
