                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib pain after motor vehicle collision.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Deformity of the left 6th rib posteriorly appears to represent a chronic
 fracture, though is new in the interval.  No acutely displaced rib fractures
 are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acutely displaced fractures identified.  Likely remote fracture of the left
 posterior 6th rib.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  If there is
 continued clinical concern for an acute rib fracture, then a dedicated rib
 series is recommended.
