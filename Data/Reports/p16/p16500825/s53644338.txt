                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Multiple facial lacerations, fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath, distal aspect not well seen,
 but may be terminating in the low SVC.  There has been interval development of
 large area of opacity projecting over the left hemithorax, particularly in the
 left mid-to-lower lung which may be due to infection, malignancy, and possibly
 underlying atelectasis.  Additionally, multiple nodular opacities, projecting
 over the right mid-to-lower lung which may be due to pulmonary nodules and
 possible metastatic disease.  There is likely a moderate left pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large
 opacity.  The superior mediastinum is not widened.  There is also likely soft
 tissue thickening along the left medial mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large area of opacity projecting over the left hemithorax, which
 may be due to malignancy, infection, with possible underlying lung collapse as
 well as there is a left pleural effusion.  Nodular opacities projecting over
 the right mid-to-lower lung raise concern for pulmonary nodules, which could
 be metastatic.
