 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pulmonary edema or vascular congestion is present.  However moderate to
 severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased, and there is new
 severe consolidation in the left lower lobe, either collapse or pneumonia,
 accompanied by new small left pleural effusion.  Hazy opacification at the
 base of the right lung could be due to recent aspiration or early pneumonia
 and should be followed closely.
 
 Dual channel left supraclavicular central venous hemodialysis catheter tips
 are in the mid and low right atrium respectively.  There is no pneumothorax.
