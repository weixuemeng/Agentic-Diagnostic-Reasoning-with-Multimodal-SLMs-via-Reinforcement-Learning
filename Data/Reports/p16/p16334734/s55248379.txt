                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post feeding tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right central line is in unchanged position, terminating in the lower SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, in unchanged position. 
 A nasogastric tube extends into the stomach.  Stable, moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Apparent increase in density in
 the left hemithorax is likely secondary to supine positioning with layering of
 the left pleural effusion, which is likely unchanged in size.  Pulmonary edema
 has resolved on the right and has improved on the left.  There is stable,
 severe left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 moderate, stable right lower lobe atelectasis and a small, stable right
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is appropriately positioned and extends into the stomach.
 2.  Interval resolution of right pulmonary edema and improvement in mild, left
 pulmonary edema.
 3.  Persistent, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions, more
 severe on the left.
