                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new nGT  // assess NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is in
 stomach.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The aortic arch is heavily
 calcified.  There is increased aeration at the lung bases bilaterally although
 the left hemidiaphragm remains obscured.  Opacification along the minor
 fissure persists.  There is persistent heterogeneous opacification of the
 right upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Overall, there is improved aeration of the lungs as compared to the prior
 study.  Specifically, there is substantial improvement in right middle lobe
 and marginal improvement in right upper lobe opacities.
 
 2.  Appropriate positioning of lines and tubes.
