                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment for left-sided rib fracture.
 
 On the current image, no left-sided rib fractures are seen.  However, the
 chest radiograph is very limited in the evaluation of rib fractures and, if
 clinically persistent, the suspicion of rib fractures should be excluded or
 confirmed with a dedicated rib series.  Minimal scarring at the level of the
 right hilus.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
