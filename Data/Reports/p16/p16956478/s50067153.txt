                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.7
 cm above the carina.  Hazy opacification in the right hemithorax is consistent
 with layering pleural effusion.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region with
 poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe and possible small effusion.  Fixation device posteriorly involves
 the mid thoracic to lower thoracic spine.
