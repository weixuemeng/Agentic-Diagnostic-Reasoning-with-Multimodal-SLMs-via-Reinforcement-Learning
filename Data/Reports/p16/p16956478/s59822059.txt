 The supporting devices are unchanged in appearance.  Since the prior study
 there is no change in the right lower lobe consolidation.  Bilateral, right
 more than left pleural effusions are most likely present.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall, stability as compared to the prior study.
