                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracic fractures with fusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is some
 increased haziness at the left base, most likely reflecting layering effusion,
 though superimposed aspiration cannot be excluded.  Generalized haziness of
 the right hemithorax is again seen and there is evidence of fixation device in
 the thoracic region.  The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen medially,
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 Endotracheal and tube and central catheters are unchanged.
