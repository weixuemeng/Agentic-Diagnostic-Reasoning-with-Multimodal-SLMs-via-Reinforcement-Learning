  Lung volumes are low which may make the tip of the PICC line appear low.  With
  better inspiration the tip is likely near the cavoatrial junction.  Opacity at
  the left base could reflect atelectasis and small pleural effusion, however
  infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
