                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC with femur Fx and s/p SBR  // NGT
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm to overlie the proximal
 stomach.  Probable focal underpenetration accounting for focal poor
 visualization of the 2 in the region of the GE junction.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette likely relates to low inspiratory volumes.  There is minimal
 atelectasis.  No CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip overlies upper stomach.
