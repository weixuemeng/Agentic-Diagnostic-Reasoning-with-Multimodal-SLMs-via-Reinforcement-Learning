                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known pneumonia and possible sepsis.  History of metastatic lung
 cancer.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  A right perihilar opacity appears to have
 increased in size compared to the prior study, likely reflecting the patient's
 known lung malignancy.  There are ill-defined bibasilar somewhat consolidative
 opacities, new in the interval.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  There is a small right pleural effusion, and likely a trace left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no frank pulmonary edema is identified. 
 Evaluation the heart size is difficult given the presence of bibasilar
 airspace opacities.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening right perihilar opacity, likely reflective of the patient's known
 lung malignancy.
 
 2. New bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for infection or aspiration. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
