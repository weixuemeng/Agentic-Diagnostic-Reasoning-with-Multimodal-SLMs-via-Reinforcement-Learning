                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with tachycardia, diaphoresis and crackles in the left
 lower lobe.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 A Port-A-Cath has been removed.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is new moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left side.  There is a focal opacity projecting
 over the lateral right mid lung that is not specific but may correspond to the
 given history of lung cancer and which persists.  In addition, there is
 superimposed widespread interstitial abnormality with upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vascularity including indistinctness, suggesting
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings most consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  
 
 2.  Persistent focal opacity projecting over the lateral right mid lung for
 which differential considerations are broad but malignancy is a consideration
 given persistence and history.  Correlation with outside imaging, if
 available, is recommended.
