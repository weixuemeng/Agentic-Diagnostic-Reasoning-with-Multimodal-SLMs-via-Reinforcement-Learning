                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post motor vehicle collision with
 bilateral chest wall tenderness.  Evaluate for acute injuries.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with mild crowding of
 bronchovascular markings, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Lucencies in the lateral aspects of the left eighth rib and
 right eleventh ribs may be nonsplaced fractures.  If there is clinical concern
 for fractures, then a dedicated rib radiographs can be ordered.
