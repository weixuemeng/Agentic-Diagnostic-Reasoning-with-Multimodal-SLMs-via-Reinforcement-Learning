                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy, evaluate lung expansion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Widening of the upper mediastinum to the right of the midline could be due to
 fluid filling in the esophagus, drained by an upper alimentary tube, ending in
 the lower third of the right paramedian mediastinum.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  Lungs are well expanded.  Pulmonary edema is mild.  Extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema can be a normal finding this early after this type of
 surgery.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is normal size.
