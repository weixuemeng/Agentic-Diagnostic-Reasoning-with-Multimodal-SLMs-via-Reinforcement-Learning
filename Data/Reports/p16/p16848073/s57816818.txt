                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after esophagectomy.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 There is slight interval decrease in pleural effusion, in particular on the
 right where the subpulmonic component is most likely substantial.  The
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable, consistent with neoesophagus.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  Small amount of left pleural effusion still present.
