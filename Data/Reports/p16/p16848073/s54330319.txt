                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus extending to muscularis mucosa,
 status post MIE, respiratory acidosis in OR, assess interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip is not well seen but probably overlies the
 lower mediastinum.  An additional right-sided chest tube is present,
 unchanged.  
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild CHF, which
 appears improved compared with earlier the same day (___ at 5:18 a.m.). 
 Irregular opacity over the right lung is slightly improved and the amount of
 pleural fluid on the right appears less.  Increased retrocardiac opacity and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle is probably unchanged.  No supine film
 evidence of pneumothorax is detected.  Leads overlie the left neck and upper
 chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Compared with  earlier the same day, improvement in CHF findings and in the
 right pleural effusion.  
 2) Patchy opacities throughout the right lung slightly improved, but
 persistent. 
 3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion
 unchanged.
