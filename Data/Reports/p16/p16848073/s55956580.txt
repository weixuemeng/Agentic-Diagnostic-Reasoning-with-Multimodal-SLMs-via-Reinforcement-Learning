                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal dilatation, to assess for perforation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the mediastinum with no evidence of post-procedure
 pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary
 markings at the right base, raising the possibility of some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen bilaterally.
