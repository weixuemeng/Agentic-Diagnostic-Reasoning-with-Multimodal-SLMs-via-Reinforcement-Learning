                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough with trouble swallowing.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with scarring or a trace
 pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Note is made of a gastric pull-through.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Possible tiny right pleural effusion versus scarring.
