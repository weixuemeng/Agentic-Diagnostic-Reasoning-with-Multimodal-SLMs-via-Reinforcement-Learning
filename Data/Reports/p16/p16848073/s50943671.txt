                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:
 Hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD appears unchanged with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is normal in size. There
 is increase in right infrahilar opacity probably correlating with focal right
 lower lobe opacity.  This is superimposed on a probably more chronic
 interstitial abnormality at the lung bases, which is greater on the right than
 left.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia or aspiration.  Suspected
 moderate interstitial disease at the lung bases.  Follow-up radiographs are
 recommended.
