                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy and
 minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy with G-tube insertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and might be consistent
 with thickening of the pleura since no appreciable pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear with
 improved aeration as compared to the prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.
