                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD2 from exlap now febrile  // Please eval for
 PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been removed.
 The lung volumes have substantially decreased, likely reflecting decreased
 inspiration.  There is a new zone of increased radiodensity in the
 retrocardiac lung regions on the left.  The most likely explanation for this
 change is atelectasis but developing pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
 Short-term repeat radiographic followup is recommended.
