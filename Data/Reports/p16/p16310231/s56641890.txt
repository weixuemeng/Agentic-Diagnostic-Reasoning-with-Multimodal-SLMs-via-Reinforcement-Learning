                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with known breast cancer with mets to bone and brain.
 Increased fever, and fatiguex4 days.  // Rule out pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.   Vague nodular opacity in
 the right upper lobe is again noted which could represent pneumonia versus
 metastatic disease. The lungs appear otherwise grossly clear. Detection of
 small nodules is limited on radiograph. No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 Heart and mediastinal contours are stable and normal. Bony structures are
 intact. No free air seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague nodular opacity in the right upper lobe as seen on recent CT could
 represent a pneumonic consolidation though metastatic disease cannot be
 excluded. Followup to resolution advised.
