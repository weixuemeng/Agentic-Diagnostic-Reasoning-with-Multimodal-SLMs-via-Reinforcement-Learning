                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer and recent
 pneumonia with ongoing shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated ___ and radiograph of the
 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 There has been interval resolution of the previously seen subtle
 reticulonodular opacities in the right upper lung.  Again seen is a right
 lower lobe opacity which is more prominent on the current radiograph. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacity in the right lower lobe may represent
 resolving pneumonia.
