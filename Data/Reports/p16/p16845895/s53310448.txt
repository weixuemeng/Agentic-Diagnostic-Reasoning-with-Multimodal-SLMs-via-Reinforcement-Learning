                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and oxygen requirement and confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Please note
 the lateral view of the chest is severely limited due to poor penetration and
 inspiration.  A rounded opacity projects over the right mid lung with
 additional increased opacity in the right medial lower lung obscuring the
 heart border.  These opacities could reflect an acute infectious process;
 however the rounded character of the midlung opacity is suspicious for a focal
 lesion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Heart is top-normal in
 size.  Prominence of the hilar contours, especially at the AP window, likely
 reflects adenopathy in the setting of known lymphoma.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right mid and lower lung opacities could reflect infectious
 process; however particularly given rounded contours of the midlung opacity,
 radiographic followup to resolution is recommended. Mediastinal adenopathy in
 the setting of known lymphoma.
