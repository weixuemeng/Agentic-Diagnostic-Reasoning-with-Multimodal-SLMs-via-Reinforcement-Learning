                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma and increased hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The appearance in the right lung has worsened with increased right lower lobe
 infiltrate and increased nodular opacities.  Some of these may be true
 nodules, or infection or neoplasm.  There is also increased effusion on the
 right .the left lung is relatively clear.  the heart is slightly enlarged. 
 There is ill definition of the mediastinum suggesting vascular engorgement
 although given history lymphadenopathy could also be contributing to this
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsened appearance to the chest with new right lower lobe infiltrate.  Rapid
 change in findings suggests that most of the new appearance is due to infectin
 or fluid overload.  An underlying neoplastic process should be assessed for
 after resolution of acute symptoms.
