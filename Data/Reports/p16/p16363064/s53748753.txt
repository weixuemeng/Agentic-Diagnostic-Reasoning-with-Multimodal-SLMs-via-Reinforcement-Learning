                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with febrile neutropenia please check for
 intra-thoracic source of fever.  // ? intra-thoracic process     ?
 intra-thoracic process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  There is some asymmetry of opacification at the left base.
 Although this could represent some asymmetric pulmonary vascular congestion,
 in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 The left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. The
 Port-A-Cath extends to the lower SVC or cavoatrial junction.
