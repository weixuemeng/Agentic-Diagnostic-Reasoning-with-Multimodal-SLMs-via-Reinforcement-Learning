 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, evaluate for pneumothorax
 after chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left chest tube with persistent but stable small
 left apical pneumothorax.  Improved aeration with persistent opacities at both
 lung bases which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration
 should also be considered.  Probable small associated pleural effusions.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the
 distal SVC, unchanged.
