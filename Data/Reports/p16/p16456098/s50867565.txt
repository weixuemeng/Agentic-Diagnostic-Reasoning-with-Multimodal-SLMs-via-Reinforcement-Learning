                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with unwitnessed fall, right rib pain // hemothorax?
 fracture?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top-normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Linear opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects an area of subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or definite pneumothorax is detected, however the right apex is
 somewhat obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area. 
 Left axillary clips are noted.  There appear to be mildly displaced fractures
 of the right lateral fifth through seventh ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly displaced right lateral fifth through seventh rib fractures.  No
 definite pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
