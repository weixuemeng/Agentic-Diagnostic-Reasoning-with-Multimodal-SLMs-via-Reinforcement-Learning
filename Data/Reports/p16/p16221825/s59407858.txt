                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // f/u effusions, atx      f/u
 effusions, atx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the left base is
 less prominent, though there is still obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.  This
 most likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis, with the difference reflecting a more upright position of the
 patient.
 Otherwise little change.
