                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma with VP shunt.  Evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___ at 4:10
 p.m.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  A
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is increased compared to radiograph
 from ___, but not significantly changed compared to the outside
 hospital radiograph from approximately two hours ago.  There is a moderate
 right basilar compressive atelectasis.  A consolidation at the right lung base
 cannot be excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The heart size is difficult to assess given the adjacent effusion.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.  A VP shunt catheter courses along the right
 aspect of the neck, thorax, and upper abdomen.  A left Port-A-Cath ends in the
 low SVC, not significantly changed.   Surgical clips are noted in the right
 mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, increased compared to
 radiographs from ___, but not significantly changed compared to
 the outside hospital radiograph from approximately two hours ago.
 
 2.  Moderate right basilar compressive atelectasis.  A concomitant
 consolidation at the right base cannot be excluded.
