                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with productive cough.  Evaluate for failure
 versus fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size.  There is some unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta.  The lungs appear grossly clear.  There is no significant
 evidence of congestive change, nor is there evidence of significant
 consolidation.  The visualized osseous structures appear grossly normal. 
 There is mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative change in the visualized
 thoracic spine.  Degenerative change in the left shoulder is also seen.
 
 Finally, there is a minimal impression on the upper cervical trachea which may
 reflect a goiter on the left side.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No good evidence of either congestive change or pneumonia.
