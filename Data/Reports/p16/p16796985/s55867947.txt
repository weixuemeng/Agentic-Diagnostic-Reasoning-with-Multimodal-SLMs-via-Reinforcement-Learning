                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:11 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.  Evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate left pneumothorax and small collection of subcutaneous air in the
 left chest wall have each changed in distribution, not appreciably in size. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  New opacification in several areas of the right lung have
 returned, and because they mimic previous appearances are probably asymmetric
 edema rather than pneumonia.  ET tube and a right PICC line and a feeding tube
 are in standard placements, respectively.  No right pneumothorax.
