                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 The purpose of this addendum is to clarify that there is a typographical error
 in the listed clinical indication contained in the report.  The word
 postmenopausal should not be present.  The indication should read:
 
  "History of large loculated pleural effusion status post chest tube
 placement, evaluate for interval change."  The report is otherwise unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:30 
 
 INDICATION:  Postmenopausal with large loculated pleural effusion status post
 chest tube placement, evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 21:39.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this postoperative
 patient status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Interval placement of a left
 pigtail catheter into the pleural space where there is a greater amount of air
 and less of a fluid component within that loculated pleural collection.  There
 is some patchy opacity within the adjacent lung, which likely reflects patchy
 lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia can not be excluded.  The right
 lung is grossly clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
