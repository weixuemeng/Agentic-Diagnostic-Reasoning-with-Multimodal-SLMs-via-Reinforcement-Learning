                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC line in place, pulled out several
 centimeters, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 6:09 a.m.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 13:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The PICC line now has its tip in the proximal SVC.  A tracheostomy tube is
 unchanged in position.  The loculated left pneumothorax is not significantly
 changed.  There is persistent but decreasing subcutaneous emphysema within the
 left lateral chest wall soft tissues.  Bilateral layering effusions are again
 seen.  There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation which may represent
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status
 post median sternotomy for CABG.
