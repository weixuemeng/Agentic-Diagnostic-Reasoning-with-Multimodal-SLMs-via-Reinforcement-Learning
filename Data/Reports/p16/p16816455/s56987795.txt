 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD, status post lap chole, now
 somnolent and improving but rule out pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the chest wall and
 neck. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Bibasilar
 airspace opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although aspiration or
 pneumonia should also be considered.  There is possibly a small left effusion.
 No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  Several clips in
 the right upper quadrant are consistent with known cholecystectomy.
