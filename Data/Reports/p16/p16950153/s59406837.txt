 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall w femur fx s/p ORIF; now w AF w RVR  // eval
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is diffuse bilateral
 interstitial thickening, which appears to have worsened in comparison to the
 prior chest radiograph.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.

 2. Diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening, which likely represents
 increased interstitial pulmonary edema, with underlying chronic interstitial
 lung disease.
