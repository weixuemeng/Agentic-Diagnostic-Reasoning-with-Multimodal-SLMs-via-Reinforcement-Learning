                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bilateral pneumonia and NSTEMI.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. There is a diffuse chronic interstitial abnormality. More dense
 opacity seen at the lung bases.  A superimposed infectious process is
 suspected. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is a 1.4-cm nodule in the right
 upper lobe, for which a CT is recommended to evaluate for malignancy. There is
 no evidence of a pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality in the lungs which are hyperinflated
 suggesing COPD.  Interstitial edema or other acute process superimposed on
 chronic lung disease is possible.  Increased density at the bases may also be
 due to infection.
 
 2.  1.4 cm nodule in the upper right lung.  A chest CT is recommended to
 evaluate for malignancy.
