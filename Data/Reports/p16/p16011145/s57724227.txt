                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of increased edema.  Please evaluate for worsening
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal. The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  Redemonstrated is a diffuse
 chronic interstitial abnormality with an most pronounced at the bases.  The
 lungs appear to be hyperinflated.  A 1.3 cm nodular density is seen projecting
 in the region of the right posterior fourth rib. More diffuse hazy opacity is
 noted along the right mid-chest wall laterally. There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no upper zone redistribution or
 new pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change compared to the most recent prior exam
 performed at 8:53 p.m. on the same day.
 
 2.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality most pronounced at the bases.  Of note,
 this has progressed significantly compared with an outside CXR from IOM dated
 ___.  While this could be related to enphysematous changes in the
 setting of hyperinflation, the possibility of a superimposed interstial
 process that has developed in the interim cannot be excluded. Moreover, a
 superimposed infectious process or superimposed CHF in an atypical
 distribution cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  1.3-cm nodular density in the upper right lung for which a chest CT is
 recommended to evaluate for malignancy.
