 limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low.  Hazy
 diffuse right airspace opacities likely reflect crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  No focal consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No sizable pleural effusion.  Mildly displaced posterior right
 fifth and sixth rib fractures are noted.
