                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rib fx and chest tube  // eval interval
 change - please schedule for ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and targeted review of chest CT
 from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has multiple known rib fractures, more completely depicted on the
 recent chest CT.  The known right clavicular fracture is not well appreciated
 on this examination.
 
 Again seen is the right chest tube.  The overall appearance is similar. 
 Slight differences in configuration could relate to differences in positioning
 and inspiratory volume.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax is probably
 unchanged.  The recent CT also showed a tiny basilar pneumothorax which is not
 appreciated radiographically.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The heart is not enlarged. 
 Aorta is minimally unfolded.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt
 CHF.  There bibasilar atelectasis, without frank consolidation.  No gross
 effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right chest tube present.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax noted, probably
 unchanged.
 2. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, without frank consolidation or gross
 effusion.
 3. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 4. Known right clavicular and multiple rib fractures, not optimally visualized
 on this examination.
