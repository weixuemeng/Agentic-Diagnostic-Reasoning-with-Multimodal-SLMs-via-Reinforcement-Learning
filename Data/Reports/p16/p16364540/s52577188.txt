                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 The lungs are low in volume and show a nodular left lower lobe opacity,
 unchanged, most consistent with a nipple.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  The mediastinal silhouette is widened on both the frontal and lateral
 films with loss of the retrosternal clear space.  The hilar contours and
 pleural surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild progressive mediastinal widening could be related to an aortic aneurysm. 
 Further evaluation with a cardiac echocardiogram or a chest CT maybe obtained.
