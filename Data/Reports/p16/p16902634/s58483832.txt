                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post dual-chamber permanent
 pacemaker placement via left cephalic vein on ___.  Evaluate lead
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The configuration
 demonstrates a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left
 and posteriorly.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated, but no
 local contour abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no evidence of
 interstitial or alveolar edema and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  A permanent pacer is seen in left anterior axillary position
 connected to two intracavitary electrodes with termination points compatible
 with right atrial appendage and right ventricular apical portion.  Skeletal
 structures demonstrate a mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature and somewhat
 demineralized vertebral bodies, but no evidence of compression fracture or
 other skeletal abnormalities in the thoracic area.  Patient was unable to
 elevate left arm for the lateral view related to recent pacemaker placement.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable position of dual intracavitary electrode pacemaker
 system.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
