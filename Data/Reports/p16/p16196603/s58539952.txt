                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS intubated  // Please evaluate for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___.
 Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT terminates approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  There are bilateral
 PICC lines, the right terminating at the cavoatrial junction, and the left
 terminating in the distal SVC.  There is an NG tube coursing below the
 diaphragm, however the tip is not visualized on this image.
 
 The bibasilar opacities have decreased, representing improving pleural
 effusions or may be due to more upright positioning.  The degree of pulmonary
 edema, most evident in the right lung, has also improved.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate and unchanged positioning of all lines and tubes.
 2. Improving bibasilar opacities, representing a combination of pleural fluid
 and atelectasis, which may be due to more upright positioning.
 3. Improving pulmonary edema.
