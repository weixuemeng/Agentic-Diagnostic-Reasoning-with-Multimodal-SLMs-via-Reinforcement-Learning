                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ARDS status post intubation.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube appears to course below the diaphragm, but the tip extends
 beyond the image margin.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.9 cm above the
 carina.  Right PICC terminates in the right atrium.  Left PICC terminates in
 the low SVC.  Stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe could reflect developing
 aspiration pneumonia.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis.  Stable, moderate, layering left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible, developing aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
