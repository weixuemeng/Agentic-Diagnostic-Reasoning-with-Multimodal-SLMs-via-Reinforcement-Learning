                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with copd, intubated  // s/p intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip is in standard position.  Enteric tube traverses the midline and
 traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant beyond the scope of this
 image.  Opacity in the left lower hemi thorax is probably a combination of
 layering small pleural effusion, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged.  Central pulmonary vessels are congested.  There is
 moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT in standard position.
 2.  Findings consistent with heart failure/volume overload.  Concurrent
 infection cannot be excluded.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
