 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS secondary to pneumonia, intubated,

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___.  The monitoring and support devices
 appear stable, with the feeding tube coiled in the pharynx though the tip
 extends into the upper stomach.
 
 The pleural effusions are less prominent on the current study, though this may
 merely represent a more upright position of the patient.  Substantial
 opacification in the retrocardiac region with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm
 is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and associated pleural
 effusion.
