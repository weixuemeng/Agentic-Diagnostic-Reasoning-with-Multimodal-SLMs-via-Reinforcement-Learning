                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recurrent right breast cancer, pleural
 effusion, assess for re-accumulation status post recent tap, becoming more
 short of breath with exertion.
 
 Comparison is made to ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval re-accumulation of a small-to-moderate sized right pleural
 effusion.  There is persistent nodularity at the right apex which would be
 concerning for pleural metastasis.  The left lung remains grossly clear and
 without a pleural effusion.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable although the right heart border is obscured by the pleural
 effusion and probable airspace opacity likely related to compressive
 atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
