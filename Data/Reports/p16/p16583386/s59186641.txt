 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with malignant right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Following thoracentesis, moderate right pleural effusion has recurred.  There
 is no mediastinal shift.  Fluid volume is no greater than it was prior to
 thoracentesis.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Left lung is clear. 
 Irregular thickening of the right apical pleural margin associated with apical
 fibrosis is grossly unchanged.  Tiny nodules could be present in the left
 lung, but would require CT scanning for detection.  Heart size is normal.
