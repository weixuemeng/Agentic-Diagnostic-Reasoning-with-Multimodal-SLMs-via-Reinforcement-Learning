                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with metastatic breast cancer and
 pleural involvement, compare to prior chest findings.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 chest examination of ___.  Heart size, thoracic aorta and
 mediastinal structures remain unchanged and are within normal limits.  No
 pulmonary congestion is present and no new acute infiltrates are seen. 
 Comparison with the next preceding study demonstrates a mild increase of the
 right-sided apical pleural thickening, measures now on the frontal view up to
 2 cm in distance.  It does not involve the pulmonary parenchyma in the apical
 area.  The pleural space remains free from any fluid accumulation and both
 right and left-sided lateral pleural sinuses are free from any pleural fluid
 blunting.  Also, the posterior pleural sinuses are unremarkable on the lateral
 view.  Comparison of the frontal views demonstrates a hazy increase of density
 in the mid field of the right lung.  This, however, appears to be related to a
 volume increase of the right breast shadow which also is more prominent
 laterally on the right side.  This finding may be an artifact related to that
 the patient pushes her right-sided breast against the x-ray equipment that
 holds the film.  Still, it is recommended to observe the right-sided breast
 which may have increased in volume in comparison with the preceding
 examination.  Efforts were made to page or reach referring physician, ___.
 ___, but name could not be identified in our register.
