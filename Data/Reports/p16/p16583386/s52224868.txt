                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and older chest radiographs
 dating back to ___ as well as CT torso of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size since the
 post-thoracentesis radiograph of ___ at 10:15 a.m.  It is now
 similar in size to the immediate pre-thoracentesis radiograph.  Adjacent
 atelectasis has developed at the right lung base.  Right apical parenchymal
 scarring appears similar to the prior study and may be due to previous
 radiation therapy.  Apicolateral right pleural thickening is not appreciably
 changed, and its nodular quality is seen to better detail on prior CT torso.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  No acute skeletal
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
