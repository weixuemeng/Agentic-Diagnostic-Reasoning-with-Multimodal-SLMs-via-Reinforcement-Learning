                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is less hazy
 opacification at the right base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
 Change in appearance may well reflect merely the upright position rather than
 any significant difference in the degree of right pleural effusion.
 
 Remainder of the study is unchanged.
