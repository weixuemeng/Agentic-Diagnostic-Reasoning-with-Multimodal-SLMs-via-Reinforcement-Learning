 INDICATION:  Tachypnea in patient status post NSTEMI.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There has been interval
 improvement in the degree of mild pulmonary vascular congestion seen
 previously.  The patient is now positioned with a large amount of leftward
 rotation which makes the left cardiac border more prominent and causes
 opacification of the left upper lobe due to the underlying scapula.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and stable
 cardiomegaly.  The remainder of the examination is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions and mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Mild improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.
