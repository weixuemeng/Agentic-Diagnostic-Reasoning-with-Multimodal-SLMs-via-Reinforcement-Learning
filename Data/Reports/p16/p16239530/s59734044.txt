                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ? community acquired PNA per outside MD,
 now with desats  // ? atelectasis vs PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable cardiomegaly, with prominence of the left ventricle.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF.  There is probable atelectasis at the left base.  The absence of a
 lateral view it is difficult to completely exclude a focal infiltrate at the
 left base.  Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation is detected.  No
 right effusion is detected.  Doubt significant left effusion.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable cardiomegaly, with prominence of the left ventricle.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 3. Atelectasis at the left base.  No definite focal infiltrate at the left
 base.  If clinically indicated, a lateral radiograph and/or comparison to
 prior radiographs could help to assess for subtle left base infiltrate.  This
 would also allow for better assessment of the left ventricular contour, which
 is somewhat atypical on these views.
 4. Otherwise, no focal opacities suggest pneumonia.  Comparison with any
 previous (outside) radiographs could help for further assessment.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 1. No definite focal infiltrate at the left base. If clinically indicated, a
 lateral radiograph and/or comparison to prior radiographs could help to assess
 for subtle left base infiltrate. This would also allow for better assessment
 of the left ventricular contour, which is somewhat atypical on these views.
 2. Comparison with any previous (outside) radiographs could help for further
 assessment.
