                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with respiratory decompensation, left
 lower lobe consolidation, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  On previous
 examination identified parenchymal infiltrates in the left lower lobe area
 have regressed.  A mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus persists. 
 No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax is present in the
 apical area.  The previously described most total opacification of the right
 hemithorax persists rather unchanged.  Multiple described calcifications
 observed on the previous examination overlying shoulder areas cannot be seen
 anymore and thus represent external artifacts.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of previously identified left lower lobe infiltrates
 suspected to be of inflammatory origin in this patient with history of
 advanced right-sided pulmonary carcinoma.  A left-sided pleural effusion
 stable blunts the lateral pleural sinus.
