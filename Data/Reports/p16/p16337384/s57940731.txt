 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 11:03 AM
  1.  New left lung base consolidation most likely represents pneumonia, less
  likely atelectasis.
  2.  Slightly increased opacification of the right apex consistent with known
  lung carcinoma.  Unchanged opacification of the right hemithorax and volume
  loss.
  3.  New soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right scapula. Given
  interval development, query whether this is external to the patient or
  palpable on exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known lung carcinoma with acute shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray and CT of the chest on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new opacification in the
 left lung base. There is unchanged opacification of the right apex, consistent
 with known lung carcinoma.  There is slightly increased opacification of the
 right hemithorax with signs of volume loss.  A pleurex catheter is noted in
 the right hemithorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is prominent, unchanged.
 
 There are several new soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right
 scapula not visualized on prior chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left lung base consolidation most likely represents pneumonia, less
 likely new pulmonary mass given short term interval development.
 2.  Slightly increased opacification of the right apex consistent with known
 lung carcinoma.  Unchanged opacification of the right hemithorax and volume
 loss.
 3.  New soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right scapula. Given
 interval development, query whether this is external to the patient or
 palpable on exam.
