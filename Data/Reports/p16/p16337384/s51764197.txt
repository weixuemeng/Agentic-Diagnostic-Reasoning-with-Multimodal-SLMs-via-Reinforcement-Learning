 consolidation secondary to a known right chest mass.  Additionally, there is
 increasing left pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis.  Assessment of the
 heart size is limited due to these opacities.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right-sided pleural effusion and
 post-obstructive consolidation in the setting of a known right chest mass;
 increasing left pleural effusion with basal atelectasis.
