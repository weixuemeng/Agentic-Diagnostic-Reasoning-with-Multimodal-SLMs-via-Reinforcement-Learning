                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough x 2 weeks  // pneumonia      pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 The pleural reflection of the left anterior mediastinum is displaced laterally
 and the normal concave lateral contour is straightened.  This suggests
 enlargement of the prevascular mediastinal contents, either adenopathy or fat.
 Any prior chest radiograph should be obtained to see if this is a new finding
 warranting CT evaluation.  Other mediastinal contours are normal and there is
 no evidence of hilar adenopathy.  Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Heart
 size is normal.  There is no pleural abnormality.
