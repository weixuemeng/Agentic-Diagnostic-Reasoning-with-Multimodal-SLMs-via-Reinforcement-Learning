                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 Increased density of the right lower hemithorax compared to the left has no
 lateral correlate and likely is related to the extrathoracic soft tissues /
 breast.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, no evidence of pneumonia.
