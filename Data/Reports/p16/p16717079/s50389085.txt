                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  The vascular pedicle has widened
 compared to prior and there is mild vascular prominence, but this is likely to
 reduced lung volumes.  There are no overt signs of pulmonary edema.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A calcified granuloma in the left mid
 lung is stable. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but the size is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes.
