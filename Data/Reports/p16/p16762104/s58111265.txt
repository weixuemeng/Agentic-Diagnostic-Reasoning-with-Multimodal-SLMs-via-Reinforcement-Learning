                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with palpitations and shortness of breath. 
 Intermittent chest pain.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior chest
 CT from ___.  Low lung volumes are seen.  Within this limitation,
 however, there is suggestion of increased interstitial markings throughout
 both lung fields.  There is no confluent consolidation or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs bilaterally
 despite low lung volumes.  This raises the possibility of interstitial edema;
 however, atypical infection can have a similar appearance.  Clinical
 correlation suggested.
