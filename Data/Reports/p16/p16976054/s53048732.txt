                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an ill-defined left basilar opacity, which is nonspecific.
 There is no pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral layering pleural
 effusions, as well as a small-to-moderate amount of fluid along the right
 major fissure.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged, and similar to the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left basilar opacity, which could be atelectasis, though in the proper
 clinical setting, pneumonia is a consideration.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and fluid layering along the right major
 fissure.
