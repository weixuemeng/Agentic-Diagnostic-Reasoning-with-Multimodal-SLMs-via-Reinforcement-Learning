                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion and fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Retrocardiac
 opacification with corresponding streaky opacities on the lateral view most
 likely represents overlapping thoracic aorta, pulmonary vascular structures
 and degenerative changes at the thoracic spine, although superimposed
 infection is not entirely excluded.  Trace fluid is seen in the major fissure
 on the lateral view.  There is no significant pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, as before.  Mild calcification
 of the aortic arch is redemonstrated with tortuosity of the descending
 thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary edema.  Small amount of fluid in major fissure on the lateral
 view.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity corresponding to the left lower lobe likely
 represents atelectasis and/or superimposed structures, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
