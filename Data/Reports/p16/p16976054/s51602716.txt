                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with sepsis and increasing
 oxygen requirement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  There is interval
 increase in the perihilar haziness and opacities consistent with increase in
 pleural edema.  There is most likely present bilateral pleural effusion, but
 note is made that the costophrenic angles show small amount of fluid which is
 probably underestimated on the current examination.
