                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with seizure versus syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung markings are
 accentuated by low lung volumes, and assessment of the lung bases is limited.
 There is likely bibasilar atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is exaggerated
 by AP technique and low lung volumes, but appears top normal in size.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis. A repeat chest radiograph with PA technique and better
 inspiration is recommended.
