                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with a h/o CAD, COPD, PVD, here with lactic
 acidosis, leukocytosis, and appeared more short of breath this morning  //
 Acute process?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, persistent convexity of the right
 mediastinal contour corresponds to a dilated ascending aorta on outside chest
 CT of ___.  Lungs are remarkable for heterogeneous opacities at
 the right lung base, which may reflect aspiration or developing aspiration
 pneumonia in this region in the appropriate clinical setting.  Nonspecific
 fibronodular opacities at the left apex are not fully characterize
 radiographically.  Hyperinflation is consistent with history of COPD.  No
 evidence pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
