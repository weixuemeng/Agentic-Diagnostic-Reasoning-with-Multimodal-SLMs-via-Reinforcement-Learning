                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post open AAA operation, evaluate
 line positions and effusions postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the
 trachea 6 cm above the level of the carina.  An NG tube has been passed and
 reaches well below the diaphragm.  The positions of the diaphragms is more
 elevated than before related to the recent surgery.  This results in crowded
 appearance of the pulmonary vasculature and some degree of perivascular haze. 
 However, no evidence of large pleural effusions as the lateral sinuses remain
 acute.  Also, there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Right
 internal jugular approach central venous line is seen to terminate in the
 right-sided mediastinum at the level of the carina.  This corresponds to the
 mid portion of the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased pulmonary congestion.  Poor inspirational effort, but
 no evidence of pneumothorax, acute infiltrates or massive pleural effusion.
