                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of left subclavian vascular catheter with no
 visible pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance,
 and bibasilar opacities have partially improved, with residual opacities,
 worse on the left than the right.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema is
 present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis, with
 adjacent small pleural effusions.
