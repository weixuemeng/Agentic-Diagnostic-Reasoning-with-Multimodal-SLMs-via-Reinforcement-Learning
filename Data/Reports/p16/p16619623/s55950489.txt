 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, evaluation for infectious processes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement, with a marked decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing
 bilateral parenchymal opacities.  At the right lung base, these opacities are
 almost completely resolved, at the left lung base, a few linear opacities
 persist.  There is unchanged minimal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm but
 no evidence of pleural effusion or other post-infectious complications.  No
 cardiac enlargement.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal
 structures.  No pneumothorax.
