 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new PICC line.  Please evaluate placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the patient

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left PICC line is seen ending at approximately the lower left-sided SVC
 probably at the junction with the coronary sinus.  No complications including
 pneumothorax are seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis continues to be seen with small left pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left PICC line ends at approximately the lower left-sided SVC although the
 exact site of the tip is difficult to pinpoint because the catheter is
 relatively radiolucent.  No complications including pneumothorax.
