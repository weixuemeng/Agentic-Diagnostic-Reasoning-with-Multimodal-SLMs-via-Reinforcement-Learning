                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ET tube placement.  Study requested for
 evaluation of ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the carina.  Left
 subclavian central venous catheter remains in unchanged position in the left
 SVC. Increased opacities persist at the right lung base with increased
 aeration in the right upper lobe.  This could be related to asymmetry of
 residual edema in the setting of COPD as well as to fissural pleural fluid.
 Left lung base has not cleared.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is
 no definite pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube is in adequate position.
 
 2.  Persistent bibasilar opacities with increased aeration of the right upper
 lobe which could be due to asymmetry of residual edema in the setting of COPD.
 Followup is recommended to rule out early developing pneumonia.
