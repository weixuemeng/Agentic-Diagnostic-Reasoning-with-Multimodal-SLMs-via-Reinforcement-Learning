                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Generalized and left-sided weakness, worse than right.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky left
 basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring, not significantly
 changed aside from slight shifting morphology.  The chest is hyperinflated. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature
 is centered along the lower thoracic spine.  Projecting over the left mid lung
 is a small irregular opacity measuring 6-7 mm, potentially a nipple shadow not
 well seen on the more recent prior examination, but possibly a parenchymal
 nodule and not necessarily corresponding to small opacities over the area
 before, which were probably due to costochondral cartilage calcification which
 this does not resemble.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Small nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung.  This potentially
 represents a nipple shadow.  An additional PA view with nipple markers may be
 helpful to confirm or refute the possibility.  If the finding does not prove
 to represent a nipple shadow then CT imaging is suggested.
