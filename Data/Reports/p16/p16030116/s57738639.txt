                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS, intubated.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 6:26 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.9 cm above
 the carina.  A right IJ line is present, tip over upper right atrium.  There
 is an orogastric-type tube present --  the tip extends beneath the diaphragm,
 off film.  However, the proximal portion of the radio-opaque distal tip of the
 tube  is seen over the expected site of gastric fundus.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, which likely accentuates the cardiac
 silhouette and vascular markings.  Allowing for this, there is cardiomegaly
 with associated prominence of the mediastinum and patchy opacities which could
 reflect pulmonary edema.  There is also more pronounced focal patchy opacity
 in the left perihilar region and left lung base and in the right
 infrahilar/cardiophrenic region.  The differential diagnosis for these
 includes pneumonic infiltrates and changes of ARDS.  No gross effusion is
 identified, though small left effusion would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Bibasilar left greater than right patchy opacities overall similar to the
 film from one day earlier, allowing for differences in technique.  Possibility
 of associated CHF cannot be excluded.
