 The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is biapical scarring and volume loss in the
 upper lobes.  In the right upper lung zone, there is a possible nodule, though
 this may be due to superimposed shadows from overlapping ribs and vessels. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process, such as pneumothorax.
 2.  Possible right upper lobe nodule.  Recommend nonemergent lordotic views. 
 If the patient is a smoker, recommend a nonemergent chest CT.
 3.  Biapical scarring and volume loss in the upper lobes, most likely from
 prior granulomatous disease.
