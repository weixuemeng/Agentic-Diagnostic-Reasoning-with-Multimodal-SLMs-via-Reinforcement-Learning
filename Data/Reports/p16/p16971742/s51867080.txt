 INDICATION:   ___M with recent diagnosis of influenza  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower on the current exam.  Despite this, there increased
 interstitial markings seen bilaterally.  There is no confluent consolidation
 or effusion.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but likely accentuated by
 lower lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs which could be in part
 due to vascular crowding in setting of low lung volumes although superimposed
 interstitial edema or atypical infection or suspected.
