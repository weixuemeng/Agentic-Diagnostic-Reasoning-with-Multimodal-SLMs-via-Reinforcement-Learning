                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pulmonary fibrosis.  Presenting with fevers, chills, and
 increasing oxygen requirements.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, with asymmetric volume loss in the right
 lung from a prior right upper lobe resection.  Surgical changes are stable in
 appearance.  Diffuse interstitial opacities are compatible with chronic
 interstitial lung disease, though there are increased interstitial opacities
 throughout both lungs.  In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is a new
 opacity in the retrocardiac region, concerning for infection.  There is no
 obvious pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New retrocardiac opacity, concerning for infection.  
 2.  Worsening interstitial opacities may represent a superimposed edema,
 atypical infection, or possibly, acute worsening of the underlying fibrosis.
