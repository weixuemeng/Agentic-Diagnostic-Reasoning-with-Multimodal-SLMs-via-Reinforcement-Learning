                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:32 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with IPF and respiratory distress.  Suspect
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Slightly lower lung volumes account for radiographic progression of diffuse
 infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, largely pulmonary fibrosis.  The global
 nature of the process suggests there could be a component of volume dependent
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding.  Relatively recent development of
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm could be an indication of decreased
 diaphragmatic function, which would contribute considerably to the respiratory
 insufficiency of already compromise lungs.  Pleural effusion, minimal if any. 
 Left jugular line ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Right apical pleural
 thickening developed over the past several years does not look like malignancy
 on recent chest CTA, ___
