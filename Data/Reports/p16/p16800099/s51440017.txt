                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath for 5 days with hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chain sutures are seen within the right hilum with evidence of asymmetric
 volume loss in the right lung compatible with prior right upper lobe
 resection.  Diffuse interstitial opacities are compatible with chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  Small amount of pleural fluid is seen on the
 right.  The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta remains
 moderately tortuous.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Calcified granuloma in the
 left mid lung field is unchanged.  Hazy opacity in the right lung base may
 reflect atelectasis or progression of known chronic interstitial lung disease.
 There is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postoperative changes in the right lung.  No pulmonary edema.  Hazy opacity in
 the right lung base could reflect atelectasis or progression of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
