 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, AP views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs dated ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Redemonstrated are essentially unchanged,
 diffuse interstitial opacities, compatible with the patient's interstitial
 lung disease.  Additionally, a retrocardiac opacity is unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or frank pulmonary edema.  A left
 IJ catheter is again seen terminating in the lower SVC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged diffuse interstitial opacities and a stable retrocardiac opacity. 
 No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.
