                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fiducial marker placement,
 evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest
 examination performed four hours earlier during the same day.  The on previous
 examination identified two fiducial markers remain in unchanged position. 
 There is now a third fiducial marker identified and seen at a lower level of
 the left hemithorax overlying posterior contour of the thoracic vertebral
 column.  Location of this third fiducial marker corresponds to the posterior
 inferior segment of the LLL. No significant post-procedural pneumothorax can
 be identified.
