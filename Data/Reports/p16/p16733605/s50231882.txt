 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased.  Both
 lung bases, areas of atelectasis are seen, left more than right.  The presence
 of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  However, there is no
 overt pulmonary edema and no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 No pneumothorax.
