                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient on aspirin, struck by car.  To assess
 for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest x-ray was obtained using portable AP technique.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Current radiograph is dated ___
 timed at 5:20 a.m.
 
 REPORT:  The patient is intubated, with the tip of the ET tube in unchanged
 position  just above the carina.  Again, this should probably be withdrawn
 slightly.
 
 An NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum to terminate in the left
 hypochondrium.
 
 There is minor blunting of both costophrenic sulci, worse on the right side. 
 There is asymmetric opacification of the right hemithorax versus the left. 
 Much of this may represent effusion though the air space change noted on the
 CT is also seen.  No definitive rib fractures are identified.
 
 CONCLUSION:  ET tube should be retracted as it lies too close to the carina.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly large on the right side.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 The findings of the low lying ET tube telephoned to Dr. ___ at the
 time of reporting, but the patient has apparently had an interval extubation.
