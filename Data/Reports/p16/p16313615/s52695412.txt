 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post pedestrian struck and respiratory failure.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study, ___.
 
 Large right pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing difference in
 positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar opacities have increased on the left,
 likely atelectasis.  Small-to-moderate left effusion is unchanged.  Lines and
 tubes are in standard position.  Cardiac size is top normal.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities.
