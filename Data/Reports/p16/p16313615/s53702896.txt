                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, struck by a vehicle with
 worsening respiratory status.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema, worsening
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared with most recent prior radiographs, there has been worsening of
 bilateral pleural effusions and right greater than left parenchymal opacities
 which likely represents worsening congestion; although, hemorrhage or
 contusion could have a similar appearance and with the appropriate clinical
 symptoms, superimposed pneumonia is also possible.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening right greater than left parenchymal opacity likely represents
 worsening congestion; however, hemorrhage or contusion could have similar
 appearance and with the appropriate clinical symptoms, superimposed pneumonia
 is also possible.
