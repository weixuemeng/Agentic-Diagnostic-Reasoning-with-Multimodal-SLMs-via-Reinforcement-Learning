                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of lung malignancy,
 presently with shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia, pulmonary
 congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable single view AP
 chest examination obtained 14 hours earlier during the same day.  The
 patient's previously described pulmonary congestive pattern as well as the
 bilateral pleural effusions that blunted the lateral pleural sinuses, more on
 the right than the left, have markedly improved.  The lateral pleural sinuses
 are almost completely free on the frontal view, but small amount of pleural
 effusions are still collecting in the posterior pleural sinuses as identified
 on the lateral view.  A previously existing perivascular haze in the lungs has
 normalized with the exception of a small plate atelectasis on the right lung
 base.  There is no evidence of any discrete local pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates that can be identified as a pneumonitis.  No pneumothorax exists
 in the apical area.  The heart size is now close to the normal range and the
 previously identified cardiac enlargement, exaggerated by the AP portable
 examination technique, appears to have improved.  When review comparison is
 extended to a PA and lateral chest examination dated ___, the
 chest finding including borderline heart size and absence of significant
 pulmonary vascular congestion are not too dissimilar.
 
 IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of pulmonary congestion diagnosed on preceding
 portable chest examination performed on the preceding night.  Mild amount of
 pleural effusions remaining, but no evidence of acute pneumonia.
 
 Referring physician, ___. ___, was informed via ___ at 4:15 p.m.
