                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for CHF or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  Hazy pulmonary vasculature suggests
 mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacifications may be a combination of
 atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
 However, cannot exclude an infectious process in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications likely represent combination of
 effusions and possibly atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Background mild
 pulmonary edema.
