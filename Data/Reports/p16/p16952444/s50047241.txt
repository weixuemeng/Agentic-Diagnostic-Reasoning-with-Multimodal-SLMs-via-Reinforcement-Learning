                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Failure to thrive, malaise. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Fullness of
 the right hilar region with linear opacities in the right lung base is
 compatible with known right hilar mass with resultant atelectasis.  Left lung
 remains grossly clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior with unchanged right hilar mass with
 right basilar atelectasis.
