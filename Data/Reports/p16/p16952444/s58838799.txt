                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  There has been interval convex
 bulging of the right mediastinal contour suggestive of increased mediastinal
 mass as well as leftward deviation of the aortic arch suggestive of possible
 increased lymphadenopathy.  Again identified is irregular right hilar contour
 from known mass with associated collapse of the right middle lobe appearing
 slightly improved compared to prior examination.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The left lung is essentially clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Roughly similar appearance of known right hilar mass with resultant right
 middle lobe collapse.
 2. Increased prominence of the right mediastinal contour and deviation of the
 aortic arch suggestive of increased mediastinal mass/lymphadenopathy.
