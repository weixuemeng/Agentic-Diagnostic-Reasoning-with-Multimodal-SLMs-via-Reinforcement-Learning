                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and fever, on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are streaky linear areas of opacity projecting over the
 right lung base which suggests atelectasis as seen on prior studies, possibly
 minimally more prominent, although this may relate to changes in patient
 positioning.  The appearance of the right hilum and right infrahilar region is
 stable in this patient with known right hilar mass.  The right costophrenic
 angle is not fully included on the frontal view, but there is no evidence of a
 large pleural effusion on the lateral view.  Left lung is clear. No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable findings of right hilar mass.  Again seen areas of right
 base atelectasis/scarring, possibly minimally more prominent as compared to
 the prior study, likely due to potentially minimally worsened right lower lobe
 atelectasis.
