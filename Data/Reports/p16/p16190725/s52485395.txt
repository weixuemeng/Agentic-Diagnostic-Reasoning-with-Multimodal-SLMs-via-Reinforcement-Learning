                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p dissection, hypoxemix  // eval pulm
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Plain film
 
 COMPARISON:  Supine portable study from earlier the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, right-sided Cordis introducer, mediastinal tubes and
 left-sided chest tube are again noted in unchanged positions. Nasogastric tube
 side-hole is probably just above the level of the gastroesophageal junction,
 unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen.  There is unchanged obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm and new haziness of the right hemidiaphragm suggesting
 overlying subsegmental atelectasis and some of this appears to be perihilar as
 well.  Plain film appearance of the arch of the aorta is unchanged
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New haziness at the right base and increased at the left base and high
 perihilar regions appears more related to atelectasis than edema.
