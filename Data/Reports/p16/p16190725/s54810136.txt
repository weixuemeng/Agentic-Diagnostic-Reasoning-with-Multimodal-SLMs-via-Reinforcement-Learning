                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman pre-pericardial window for tamponade  // pre-op
 baseline study in unstable patient Surg: ___ (pericardial window)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right,
 increased since ___.  Interval increase in already moderately enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is due at least to progressive cardiomegaly and
 mediastinal venous engorgement but perhaps to mediastinal or pericardial fluid
 collection as well. Mild pulmonary edema may have developed, but the severity
 is exaggerated by the con current pleural effusions.
