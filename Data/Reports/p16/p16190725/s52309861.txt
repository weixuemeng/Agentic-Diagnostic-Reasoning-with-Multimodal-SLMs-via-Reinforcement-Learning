                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pericardial window.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina and should be
 withdrawn 3 cm for standard positioning. Bilateral chest tubes, mediastinal
 drains and an enteric tube are well positioned.  A left paramedian drain is
 sharply angulated and should be revised if poorly functioning. Sternotomy
 wires are constant.
 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural
 effusions, if there were any before, have resolved.  The cardiac silhouette is
 smaller in size and pulmonary edema has resolved after pericardial window
 formation. Postoperative appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged from
 yesterday.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube should be withdrawn 3 cm for better positioning. 2.
 Resolution of mild pulmonary edema and decrease in size of the cardiac
 silhouette after pericardial window formation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___,
 NP via telephone on ___ at 11:09 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
