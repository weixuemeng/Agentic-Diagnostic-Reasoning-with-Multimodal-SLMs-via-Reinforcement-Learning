                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall three weeks ago with pain in left flank and decreased breath
 sounds.  Evaluate for rib fracture and pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle which may be a function of atelectasis or a
 small pleural effusion.  No definite rib fracture is identified.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear, and the cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis and possible minimal left pleural
 effusion with no clear evidence of rib fracture.  If clinical concern
 persists, recommend dedicated rib series for evaluation of rib fracture.  No
 pneumothorax. If clinical findings are progressing, correlation with cross
 sectional imaging is recommended.
