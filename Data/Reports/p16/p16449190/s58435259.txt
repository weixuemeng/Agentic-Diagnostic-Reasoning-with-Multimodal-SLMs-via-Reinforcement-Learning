                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous with mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Focal round opacity within the right lung base measuring
 approximately 7.0 x 5.4 cm is demonstrated along with a small to moderate size
 right pleural effusion.  Additional somewhat discrete opacity is noted within
 the anterior right upper lobe on the lateral view.  Left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large rounded right basilar opacity and second additional opacity is noted
 within the right upper lobe anteriorly on the lateral view.  While these
 findings could suggest infection, CT of the chest is recommended to exclude an
 underlying mass lesion.  Small to moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
