                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacities at the left lung base are most
 suggestive of atelectasis, especially given low lung volumes.  Lungs are clear
 of large confluent consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are as detailed on rib x-ray from the same day, noting calcified
 left breast soft tissue lesions and possible left lateral 11th rib fracture
 which is not well seen on this exam.
