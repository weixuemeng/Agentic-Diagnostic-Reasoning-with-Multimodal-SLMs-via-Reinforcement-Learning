                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for retained portion of a central line
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as before.  Aeration of the
 left lung has markedly improved consistent with improving atelectasis.  There
 is unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged as before.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.  There is no evident pneumothorax.
 
 There are no evident radiopaque foreing bodies, though the evaluation is
 limited due to the presence of multiple external wires.
