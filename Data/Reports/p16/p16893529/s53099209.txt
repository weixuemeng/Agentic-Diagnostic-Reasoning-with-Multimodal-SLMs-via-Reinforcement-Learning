                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with low oxygen saturation.  Question acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___ and CT dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a markedly rotated
 patient to the left as well as a poorly penetrated radiograph.  Allowing for
 such, a right PICC is likely stable in location with the tip in the region of
 caval-brachiocephalic junction or upper SVC.  Severe cardiomegaly is likely
 accentuated by AP technique.  Apparent increased confluent opacity in the left
 base has no correlate on subsequent CT.  There is suggestion of mild pulmonary
 edema, which is not apparent on the subsequent CT.  Streaky opacity in the
 lingula likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Highly limited exam by body habitus and underpenetration.
 2.  Severe cardiomegaly.  No definite pulmonary pathology. 
 
 Please refer to subsequent CT abd/pelvis for additional details.
