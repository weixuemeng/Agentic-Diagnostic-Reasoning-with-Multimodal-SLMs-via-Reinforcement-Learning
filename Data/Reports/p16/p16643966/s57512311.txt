                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Mild cardiomegaly, increased since ___ is
 exaggerated by mild pectus deformity.  There are multiple healed right rib
 fractures. Irregular thickening of the left apicolateral pleural margin in a
 region of prior pleuroparenchymal scarring is more likely a mass than
 peripheral consolidation or infarct in the left upper lobe. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or CHF.  Possible left apical mass, would require CT
 for elucidation.
 
 Report was emailed to ED QA nurses for followup of patient discharged prior to
 final review.
