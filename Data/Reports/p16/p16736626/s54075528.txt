                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and aortic
 valve replacement.  Cardiac silhouette appears larger than on prior study, but
 may be accentuated by portable technique.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Lungs are clear except for suboptimal evaluation of left retrocardiac region,
 with similar appearance of streaky opacities compared to older radiograph of
 ___.  No definite areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral views of the chest may be helpful for
 more complete evaluation of the lung bases when the patient's condition
 allows.
