                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Slight
 prominence of the pulmonary markings may relate to low lung volumes although
 minimal interstitial edema is not excluded.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, no significant interval change.  Low lung volumes, which
 accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Slight prominence of the pulmonary
 markings may be due to low lung volumes although minimal interstitial edema is
 not excluded.
