                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary edema, but no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.  Surgical
 anchors project over the right humeral head indicating prior rotator cuff
 repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary edema.
