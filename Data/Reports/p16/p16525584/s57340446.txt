                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are decreased compared to the recent prior study. Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is difficult to exclude in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable mild
 cardiomegaly is present. Again seen is prior evidence of right rotator cuff
 repair.
 
 IMPRESSION: Possible mild pulmonary edema. Low lung volumes limits evaluation.
