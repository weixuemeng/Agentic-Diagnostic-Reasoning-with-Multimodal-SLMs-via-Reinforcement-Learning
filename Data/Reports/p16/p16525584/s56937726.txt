 HISTORY:  Chest congestion shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Slight prominence of the perihilar
 vasculature may relate to low lung volumes however component of pulmonary
 vascular congestion is not excluded.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in inspiration.
