                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs and CT from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A right lower
 lobe consolidation is not well seen but was depicted on the recent prior CT. 
 In the left mid lung, there is vague increased opacity in the left lower lung.
 Pulmonary vasculature appears minimally prominent.  Chronic-appearing
 left-sided rib deformities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Developing patchy opacity at the left lower lung.  Pneumonia or
 atelectasis could be considered.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful.  A consolidation seen on CT performed since the prior chest
 radiographs is not well visualized given that it lies posterior to the right
 hemidiaphragm.
