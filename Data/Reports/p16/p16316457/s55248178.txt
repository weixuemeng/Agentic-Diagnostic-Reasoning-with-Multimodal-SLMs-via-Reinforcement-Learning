                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates at the right lower superior vena cava.  The
 heart is probably enlarged to a mild degree.  There is marked unfolding of the
 aorta and the arch may be dilated.  Flattening of the right costophrenic
 sulcus suggests potentially an effusion versus pleural thickening or scarring,
 but the lungs appear clear.  Left-sided rib deformities appear very likely
 chronic, with a remodeled appearance, and probably related to remote prior
 trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute process.  Dilatation of the aorta.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic sulcus, possibly due to an effusion.  PICC line
 terminating in the lower superior vena cava.
