                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with Down syndrome and history of
 multifocal pneumonia, here with ___ and ___ cough concerning for vasculitis
 versus infection.  Evaluate for focal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, vasculitis
 changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is well
 within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Again noted are bilateral patchy widely
 disseminated parenchymal densities in both lungs predominantly in the lower
 lung fields.  They are of similar character as they have been seen on previous
 examinations.  On the next preceding study of ___, the patient had
 undergone improvement of these lung changes, but they have now again increased
 and are similar to those encountered during examinations in ___. 
 Noteworthy is that the pleural spaces remain now free both laterally and
 posteriorly.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The described changes must be identified as "atypical".  The
 waxing and waning that has been noticed of these changes overtime makes an
 infectious course unlikely unless clinical tests have documented such
 possibility.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is most unlikely as the heart
 remains normal in size throughout.  Vasculitis changes in the pulmonary tissue
 are a possibility but cannot be specifically diagnosed with plain x-ray.
