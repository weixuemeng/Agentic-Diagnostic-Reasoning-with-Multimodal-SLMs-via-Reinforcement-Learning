                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  SAH  // Is OGT in place
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 15:39.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube
 terminates within the stomach, with the side hole just below the diaphragm.
 There is a new right basilar opacity, likely reflecting a combination of a new
 moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. The
 heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Orogastric tube terminating within the stomach, with the side hole just
 below the diaphragm.
 2.  New moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
 Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
