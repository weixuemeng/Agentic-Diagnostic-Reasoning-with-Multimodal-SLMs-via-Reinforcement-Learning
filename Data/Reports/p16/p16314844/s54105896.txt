                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with fever and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an increased opacity overlying the right hemithorax;
 however, the patient has pectus excavatum. Additionally, there is a small
 nodularity overlying the upper lungs on the lateral view. Otherwise, the
 remainder of the lungs are clear.  Mediastinal silhouette is normal.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  The left PICC is visualized with the
 catheter tip at the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Opacity in the right hemithorax could be right middle lobe pneumonia, or
 more likely an artifact of pectus excavatum. As a result, oblique views are
 recommended for further evaluation.
 2. Small retrosternal nodule can also be further assessed on oblique views.
