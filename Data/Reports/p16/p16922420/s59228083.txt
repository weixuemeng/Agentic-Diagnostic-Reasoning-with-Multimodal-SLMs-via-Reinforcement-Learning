                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, status post tricuspid valve replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously noted opacity overlying the right mid lung appears
 relatively stable.  Previously noted bilateral pleural effusions have
 decreased in size.  Previously noted fluid within the right oblique fissure
 has also decreased in size.  The mediastinal wires appear intact and aligned. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears moderately enlarged but stable.  Mild
 prominence of pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously noted opacity in right mid lung persists and pneumonia
 must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.  Otherwise, there has been an
 interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions and fluid within the right
 oblique fissure. Followup to resolution of this opacity with imaging is
 recommended.
