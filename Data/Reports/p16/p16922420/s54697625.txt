                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post tricuspid valve replacement. 
 Evaluation for effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views are obtained.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable in the post-operative setting.  The previously seen
 opacification in the right mid lung is improved since the prior study and
 likely reflects a pleural effusion with fluid collection along the oblique
 fissure.  Median sternotomy wires and valve replacement are again seen,
 unchanged in position since the prior study.  There is persistent haziness of
 the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting a component of congestion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in right mid lung opacity.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions with some fluid along the oblique fissure.  Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette in the post-operative period.
