 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Reported episodes of desaturation, now normal, assess for

 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained as well as a
 lateral view.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with mild
 compressive bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no significant change from prior
 exam.  There is no overt CHF.  A mild component of interstitial congestion is
 impossible to exclude.  The aorta is unfolded.  Heart size is normal.  No
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis.  Possible mild interstitial edema.
