                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with severe COPD, recent elevated blood
 sugars, intermittent cough, evaluate for infiltrates or interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP and lateral
 chest examination of ___.  Cardiac enlargement has decreased and
 now is considered to be moderate.  Previously described permanent pacer with
 ICD intracavitary electrode remains in unchanged position.  The previously
 existing advanced pulmonary congestive pattern, likely interpreted as
 representing pulmonary edema, has regressed practically completely.  No
 remaining or new pulmonary infiltrates can be identified and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Thus,
 presently no evidence of significant CHF or acute infiltrates.
