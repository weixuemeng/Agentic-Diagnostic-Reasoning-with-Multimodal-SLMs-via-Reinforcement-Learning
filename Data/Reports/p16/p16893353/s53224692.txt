                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever, cough and confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, ___, and CT exam of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 Single-lead AICD projects over right ventricle.  Heart is moderately enlarged.
 There is likely a small left pleural effusion.  Bilateral predominantly
 central confluent airspace opacities are noted.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Partially imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  Confluent bilateral central airspace opacities most
 likely represent moderate pulmonary edema, although superimposed infection,
 particularly in the right lung base, cannot be excluded.
