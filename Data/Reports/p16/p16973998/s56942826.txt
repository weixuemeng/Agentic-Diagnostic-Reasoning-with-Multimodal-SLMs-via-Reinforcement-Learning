                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer, pneumonia, pericardial
 effusion, intubated.  // eval ETT placement, pneumonia, pulm congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Support lines and tubing are unchanged in position when compared to the prior
 study.  Catheter tubing projecting over the left heart border is presumed to
 represent a pericardial drain.  Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the
 prior study with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild prominence of
 the pulmonary vasculature with haziness of the upper lobe pulmonary vessels
 consistent with a mild degree of congestive heart failure.  No pneumothorax
 seen.  A hazy airspace opacity in the left lower lung is similar when compared
 to the prior study and likely represents atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
