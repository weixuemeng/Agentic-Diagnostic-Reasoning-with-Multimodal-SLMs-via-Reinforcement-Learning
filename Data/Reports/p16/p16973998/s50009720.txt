 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chest radiograph ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior
 study.  Lung volumes are also unchanged, there is persistent left basilar
 atelectasis.  There is increasing opacification seen at the right lung base
 suspicious for right middle lobe consolidation.  Mild cardiomegaly and
 prominence of the pulmonary vascular is consistent with congestive heart
 failure, unchanged compared to the prior study.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Increasing opacity at the right lung base may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection.
