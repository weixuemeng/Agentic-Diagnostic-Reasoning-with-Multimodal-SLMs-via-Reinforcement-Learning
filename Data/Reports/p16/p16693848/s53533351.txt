                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post open AAA repair with diminished
 breath sounds and productive cough, rule out effusion/infiltrate/vascular
 congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the
 upright position.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is
 persistence of the left small-moderate pleural effusion with surrounding
 atelectasis.  Right pleural effusion is nearly resolved.  Lungs are more
 transparent and better aerated.  No pulmonary vascular congestion and no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No discrete areas of consolidation in the visualized portions of the lungs
 to suggest pneumonia.  Pneumonia within the left base masked by the  effusion
 and atelectasis cannot be excluded and requieres clinical coorelation.
 2.  Unchanged small-moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
