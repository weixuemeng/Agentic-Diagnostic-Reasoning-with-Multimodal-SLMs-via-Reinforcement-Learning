                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and lethargy.  Evaluate for
 possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Borderline heart size and moderately widened and elongated thoracic
 aorta with calcium deposits in the wall are unchanged in this elderly patient.
 No significant pulmonary vascular congestion has developed.  Poor
 inspirational effort and patient in sitting position result in crowded area of
 pulmonary vasculature on the bases.  When comparison is made with the next
 preceding chest examination, one can identify a localized parenchymal
 infiltrate to have developed on the left base in the posterior segment of the
 left lower lobe.  This finding thus is new and compatible with the clinically
 questioned aspiration pneumonitis.  Need for followup examination depends on
 clinical presentation.  Telephone call was placed to Dr. ___ on ___
 as requested.  The call was directed to an automatic recording system and the
 information delivered at 1:29 p.m.
