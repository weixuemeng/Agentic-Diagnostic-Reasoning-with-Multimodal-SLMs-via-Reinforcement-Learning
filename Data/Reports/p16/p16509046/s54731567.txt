                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of bilateral leg pain and
 swelling, left greater than right.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 axillary stents are seen coursing to the right upper extremity, not fully
 imaged.  Dual-lumen left-sided dialysis catheter is seen, with lumens
 terminating in the right atrium.  There are low lung volumes.  Moderate
 bibasilar atelectasis is seen, underlying consolidation due to infection
 and/or aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusions are seen,
 although a trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There
 may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation and/or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Low lung
 volumes.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.
