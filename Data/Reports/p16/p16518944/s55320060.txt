                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain after shoveling snow
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Opacity projecting over the
 right cardiophrenic angle is unchanged, and again may reflect a prominent fat
 pad. Lungs are clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Unchanged opacity projecting over the
 right cardiophrenic angle. Again, this could potentially reflect a prominent
 fat pad, but could be correlated with CT.
