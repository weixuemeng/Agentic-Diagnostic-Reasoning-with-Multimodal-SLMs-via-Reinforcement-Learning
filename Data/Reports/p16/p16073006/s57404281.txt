                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/P rij placement  // eval line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Interval placement of a right IJ
 central venous catheter with its tip extending into the right atrium. Right
 mid and lower lung opacities are again noted consistent with multifocal
 pneumonia.  Otherwise no change.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ central venous catheter tip terminates in the right atrium. 
 Retraction by at least 5-6 cm would result in more optimal positioning.
