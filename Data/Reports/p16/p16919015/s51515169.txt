                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ weeks cough and left lateral pleuritic
 chest pain, some dyspnea with exertion, ecg is not diagnostic  // evaluate for
 atelectasis, bony abnormalities, evidence of lung infarction, etc.
 
 TECHNIQUE:   PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a displaced left posterolateral eighth rib fracture, as well as a
 question of a left-sided ninth rib nondisplaced fracture. Adjacent to the left
 eighth rib fracture, there is an extrapleural lentiform opacity likely
 representing hematoma. Additionally, there is suggestion of minimal left-sided
 effusion with left intrafissural fluid, potentially representing minimal
 hemothorax. There is left lingular atelectasis which obscures the left heart
 border. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. It is recommended to obtain
 dedicated rib films of the bony thorax for further evaluation. If pathologic
 fracture is suspected, it would be recommended to obtain CT of the chest.
 
 There is a rightward rotation of the patient. This, as well as opacification
 obscuring the left heart border, limits evaluation of cardiac silhouette. The
 mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The bilateral hila appear
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left posterolateral eighth rib displaced fracture with adjacent
 extrapleural hematoma, and possible minimal left hemothorax.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Suggestion of nondisplaced left ninth rib fracture.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:50, approximately 15 minutes after
 discovery.
