                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes demonstrate calcification of the
 aortic arch but otherwise appear grossly unremarkable.  There is slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, probably representing changes of
 atelectasis.  No definite consolidative process is seen.  No other focal
 pulmonary opacity, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  Examination
 of osseous structures demonstrate mild anterior shortening of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body, but are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable atelectasis at the right lung base.  No definite consolidation.
