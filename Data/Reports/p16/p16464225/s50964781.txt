 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever of unknown origin, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Underpenetration due to body habitus slightly limits assessment.  Allowing for
 this there is no convincing evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema,
 or pneumothorax.  A small right pleural effusion is possible.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible small right pleural effusion, otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
