                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope  // Please eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. No focal
 infiltrate to suggest pneumonia is identified.
 
 Again seen is COPD, mild cardiomegaly, prominent pulmonary arteries, vascular
 plethora, bibasilar atelectasis and/or scarring, and an eventrated right
 hemidiaphragm. The previously seen posterior left effusion is smaller, and
 there is residual blunting of both costophrenic angles. Osteopenia,
 compression fractures, hand sites of vertebroplasty are again noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 No focal infiltrate identified to suggest pneumonia. Extensive chronic changes
 appear stable.
