                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___ with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The
 aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are similar in size compared to the prior study.
 There is associated atelectasis in the lung bases. No new focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is present. Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of COPD.
 Multiple compression deformities are again seen within the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine, some of which have undergone vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. Unchanged
 compression deformities within the thoracolumbar spine.
