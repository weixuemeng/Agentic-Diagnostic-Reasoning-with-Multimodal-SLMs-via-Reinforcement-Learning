                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient who is a long time smoker
 with 2-cm FDG-avid right upper lobe spiculated mass after right thoracotomy
 and right upper lobe wedge resection reassessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The right chest tube is in place.  There is small apical pneumothorax,
 unchanged since the prior study.  The post-surgical opacity in the right upper
 lung is redemonstrated.  Left pleural effusion is most likely present,
 unchanged.  Overall, the appearance of the chest including substantial
 dextroscoliosis is stable.
