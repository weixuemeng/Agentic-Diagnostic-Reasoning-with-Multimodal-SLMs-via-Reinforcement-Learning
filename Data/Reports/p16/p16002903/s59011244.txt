                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up right pneumothorax.  The patient is status post
 right upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax is unchanged.  Small-to-moderate left effusion has
 minimally increased.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally increased. 
 There is no left pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the
 left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  Severe right scoliosis is
 again noted.  Opacities surrounding the surgical chain in the right upper lung
 are grossly unchanged.  There are no other changes.  Right chest tube is not
 visualized.
