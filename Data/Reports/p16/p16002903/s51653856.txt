 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT torso from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Overlying EKG leads are present. 
 There is suture material projecting over the right upper lung as on prior. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated and somewhat lucent which may reflect emphysema. 
 Linear density in the right lower lung abutting the diaphragm is likely
 atelectasis or scarring.  There is no focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a severe dextroscoliosis of the T-spine.  Partially
 imaged vertebroplasty changes in the mid lumbar spine noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs without convincing signs of pneumonia or edema.
