                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 On the AP view, there are two vague opacities in the right mid and lower lung
 measuring approximately 1 cm each, which may represent a confluence of
 overlapping shadows or may arise from the ribs.  Recommend oblique film for
 further evaluation to rule out a pulmonary nodule.  Left axillary surgical
 clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Vague 1-cm opacities in the
 mid and lower right lung only seen on the PA view.  Recommend oblique views
 for further evaluation.
