                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged, similar to that seen previously. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Numerous masses in the lungs bilaterally
 compatible with metastases have increased in size and number.  A large right
 pleural effusion has substantially increased in size from the previous study
 with associated right basilar atelectasis.  Streaky atelectasis is noted in
 the left lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are moderate
 degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine with partially imaged
 posterior fusion hardware spanning the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, now large,
 with right basilar atelectasis.  Increased size and number of multiple
 metastases within the lungs.
