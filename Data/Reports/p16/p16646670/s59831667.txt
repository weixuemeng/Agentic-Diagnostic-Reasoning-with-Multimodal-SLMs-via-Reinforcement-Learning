                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary nodules s/p R VATS wedge
 resections x 3  // rule-out pneumothorax, hemothorax      rule-out
 pneumothorax, hemothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 17 34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There has been interval
 placement of a right chest tube and interval appearance of patchy opacity in
 the right mid lung which likely is postoperative in etiology given the
 presence of chain sutures in this vicinity.  No large pneumothorax is
 appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished as
 the patient was imaged supine.  Lung volumes are lower and the vasculature is
 slightly prominent but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions. 
 Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on the recent
 chest CT dated ___.
