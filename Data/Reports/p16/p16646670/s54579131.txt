 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___:32.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No detectable change in the right hemi thorax.  One drainage catheter projects
 over the right diaphragmatic region and a second more superiorly.  Extensive
 right pleural effusion persist.  No pneumothorax.  Multiple pulmonary
 metastases, some cavitated.  Heart is moderately enlarged, increased since
 earlier in the day and mediastinal veins appear larger as well suggesting
 increased intravascular volume.
 
 However there is no way to exclude the development of pericardial effusion. 
 Clinical correlation recommended.
