                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___. 
 Outside hosptial chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.  The heart continues to be
 enlarged, likely due to the exaggerating effect of AP projection.  The lungs
 demonstrate minimal retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view which likely
 corresponds to moderate pleural fluid and atelectasis better seen on prior CT.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal retrocardiac opacity, likely representing atelectasis,
 with a moderate pleural effusion.
