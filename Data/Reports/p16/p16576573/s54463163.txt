                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Fissures appear
 slightly thickened, but there is no evidence for parenchymal edema. 
 Bilaterally, nipple shadows are visualized.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear
 clear.  Small-to-moderate osteophytes are noted along mid through lower
 thoracic spinal levels.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
