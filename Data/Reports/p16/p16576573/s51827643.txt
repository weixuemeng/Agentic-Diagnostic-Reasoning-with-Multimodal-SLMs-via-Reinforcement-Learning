                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph excludes the left costophrenic
 angle and is slightly rotated.  Within this limitation, cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Bibasilar streaky opacifications, left greater
 than right, likely represent atelectasis, though cannot exclude an infectious
 process in the appropriate clinical setting.  Degenerative changes are noted
 at the bilateral humeral heads and acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar streaky opacifications, left greater than right, likely
 represent atelectasis, though infection not excluded.
