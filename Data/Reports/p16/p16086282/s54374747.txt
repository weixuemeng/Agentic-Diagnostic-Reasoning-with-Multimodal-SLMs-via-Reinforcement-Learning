                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fall cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again a large mass occupying the left upper lobe, but what is new is
 a substantial pleural effusion on the left and probable associated atelectasis
 of at least parts of the left lower lobe.  Overall, there is mildly positive
 mass effect toward the right side.  The right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New pleural effusion and basilar opacification on the left, the latter
 probably compatible with atelectasis.  New coinciding infection in the setting
 of a known left upper lobe mass is not excluded, however, including the
 potential for post-obstructive pneumonia.
