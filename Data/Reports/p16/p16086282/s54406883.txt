 There has not been any appreciable change radiographically since ___

 hilar mass around a large necrotic upper lobe mass, or in small loculated left

 catheters in place.  Right lung is clear.  Mediastinum is midline. The small
 volume of air in the left lateral costal pleural collection is probably
 insignificant clinically.
