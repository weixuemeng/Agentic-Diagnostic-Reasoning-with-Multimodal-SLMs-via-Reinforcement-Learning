                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with a history of
 non-small cell lung cancer and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a loculated left pleural
 effusion, similar in appearance compared to ___.  A left upper lobe
 cavitary mass is visualized, but better evaluated on CT.  Patchy opacities in
 the right hemithorax may represent persistent foci of pneumonia or pulmonary
 nodules.  Left lower lobe consolidations are not well seen secondary to
 overlying pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Scattered opacities in the right hemithorax corresponding to the opacities
 seen on prior CT are visualized, likely unchanged allowing for differences in
 technique.  Left lower lobe consolidations seen on prior CT are not well
 evaluated secondary to overlying pleural fluid.
 2. Unchanged loculated left pleural effusion.
 3. The known left upper lobe cavitary mass is visualized, but better evaluated
 on CT.
