  ETT terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. NG tube courses below the diaphragm
  and terminates outside the field of view. Interstitial edema is mildly worse
  in the right upper lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 6 mm nodule in
  the right midlung is incidentally noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine AP view of the chest provided. There has been interval
 intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing 3.1 cm above the
 carina. An orogastric tube descends into the upper abdomen though the tip is
 excluded from view. Perihilar ground-glass opacities are re- increased in the
 interval concerning for developing edema, less likely aspiration. Calcified
 right mid lung granuloma is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube and OG tube positioned appropriately. Increasing perihilar
 ground-glass opacity concerning for worsening edema versus aspiration.
