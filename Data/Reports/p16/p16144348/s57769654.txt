 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET Tube has been removed.  There is diffuse alveolar consolidation more
 prominent centrally with relative sparing peripherally, consistent with
 pulmonary edema. Due to diffuse involvement of the lungs it is difficult to
 assess underlying pneumonia. Similar pattern can be seen in diffuse pneumonia
 or ARDS. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
