 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 3 day cough, DOE, no fever, had chills.
 non-smoker. h/o pneumonia  // r/o pneumonia     r/o pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.  2 areas of
 abnormality or unexplained.  On the frontal view of the left paraspinal and
 para-aortic lines are obscured and there is greater than expected radiodensity
 projecting over the descending thoracic aorta.  On the lateral view there is
 greater than the expected radiodensity projecting over the mid thoracic spine
 at the level of the carina.  Since the patient has acute symptomatology, would
 be reasonable to repeat the chest radiographs in 2 weeks.  Alternatively,
 chest CT could be performed now.
 
 Lungs are clear elsewhere.  Heart size is normal and there is no pleural
 effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiographs in 2 weeks, to see if chest CT is
 indicated at that time.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 11:49 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
