                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.  Tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina and is in adequate
 position.  An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, tip terminates in
 the gastric fundus.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Bilateral diffuse parecnhymal opacities have worsened since
 prior examination.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina and is in adequate
 position.  
 
 2.  Increased bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities likely reflect worsened
 non cardiogenic pulmonary edema, likely neurogenic edema.
