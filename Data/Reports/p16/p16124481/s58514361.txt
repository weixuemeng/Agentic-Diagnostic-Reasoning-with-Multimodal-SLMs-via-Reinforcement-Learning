                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:43.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases most
 likely reflect atelectasis.  These findings appear relatively unchanged
 compared to the previous radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
