                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, asthma exacerbation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within
 normal limits.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no
 pulmonary edema is present.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be completely excluded.  Repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory
 effort may be helpful to better assess the lung bases.
