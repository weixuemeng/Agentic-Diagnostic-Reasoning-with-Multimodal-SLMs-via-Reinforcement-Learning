                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are very low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The lungs remain clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  If better evaluation of the lung
 bases is needed clinically, then repeat views with better inspiratory volume
 could be considered if needed.
