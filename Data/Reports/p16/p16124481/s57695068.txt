                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size
 is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Right lung base opacities are
 slightly more conspicuous since prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes.  Right lung opacity may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
