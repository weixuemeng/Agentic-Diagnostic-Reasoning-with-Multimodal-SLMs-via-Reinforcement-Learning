                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest.  There are bilateral
 opacities consistent with pulmonary alveolar edema.  In the right lower lung,
 a more confluent opacity may represent pneumonia.  Possible small right
 pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Sternotomy wires,
 mediastinal clips, and prosthetic valve are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Possible superimposed right
 lower lobe pneumonia.
