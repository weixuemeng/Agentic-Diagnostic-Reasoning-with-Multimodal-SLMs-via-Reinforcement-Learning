                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:09 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with CHF exacerbation and possible pneumonia. 
 Assess progression of edema after diuresis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement represents continued improvement in
 cardiac function which previously produced remission of pulmonary edema.  I am
 not sure that I can see the questioned pneumonia.  There is a small area of
 increased radiodensity in the right lower lung zone, but this looks more like
 residual edema and overlying bony structures than pneumonia.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and stigmata of previous mitral valve repair
 noted.
