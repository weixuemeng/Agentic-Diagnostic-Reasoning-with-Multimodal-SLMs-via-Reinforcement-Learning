 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate well-expanded clear

 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.  The right atrial lead has a
 different orientation on both the PA and lateral views as compared to the most
 recent prior radiograph, and is now more inferior and posterior. The right
 ventricular lead is in the normal position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The right atrial lead has a different orientation on both the PA
 and lateral views as compared to the most recent prior radiograph, and is now
 more inferior and posterior. Recommend echocardiogram for more additional
 localizing information regarding the position of this lead.
