                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:02 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Persistent cytopenia.  Presumed myelosuppression.  Sepsis. 
 Subclavian placed yesterday.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema was widespread on ___, but cavitation on the left
 indicated concurrent infection.  Residual cavitation even in the right lung is
 detectable on ___, but continues to clear.  Improving, but still
 substantial is left lung consolidation and a small left effusion, due to
 widespread pneumonia.  Heart is borderline enlarged and whether this is due to
 mild cardiac enlargement or pericardial effusion would require either CT
 scanning or ultrasound evaluation.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.
