                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after exploratory
 laparotomy and reduction of volvulus.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Minimal atelectasis is noted, overall
 not substantially changed since the prior examination, that might at least on
 the left reflect in part the previously present distention of the abdomen.
