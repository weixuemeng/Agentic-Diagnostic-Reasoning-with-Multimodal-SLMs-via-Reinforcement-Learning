                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of breast cancer.  Persistent cough and fever on
 antibiotics.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Significant opacification of the lingula causes silhouetting of the
 left heart border. The remainder of the airspaces are clear.  Some enlargement
 of the heart is noted but is incompletely evaluated due to the overlying
 infiltrate.  The pulmonary vessels are normal and there is no pulmonary edema.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lingular pneumonia.  Repeating the radiograph after treatment can help
 evaluate for underlying mass or other airway obstructing lesions. 
 
 2.  Some enlargement of the heart is incompletely evaluated due to the
 overlying infiltrate.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___,
 ___, at 2:45 p.m. on ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
