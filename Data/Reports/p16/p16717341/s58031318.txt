                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with previously diagnosed infiltrate
 in left upper lobe lingula.  Followup examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar examination of
 ___.  Heart size, mediastinal structures, and the aorta are
 unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  The previously
 identified density with atelectatic character in the periphery of the left
 upper lobe lingula persists.  There may be a mild improvement; however,
 significant amount of density of the peripheral parenchyma remains particular
 well illustrated on the lateral view.  No other new abnormalities are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonic infiltrates with rather slow resolution.  It is
 recommended to perform a further followup in about two weeks, and if no
 satisfactory resolution has been obtained, then we would have to consider to
 perform a chest CT to evaluate for a centrally located bronchial obstruction.
