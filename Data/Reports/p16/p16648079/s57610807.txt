  1. Endotracheal tube at the level of the thoracic inlet and the upper airway.
  Consider advancing 1.5 cm for better positioning. 2. Aerated lung extending
  inferiorly down the left costophrenic angle. Although this is not a deep
  sulcus sign if clinical concern for pneumothorax consider upright or decubitus
  radiograph for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p intubation. Assess endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube at the
 level of thoracic inlet, in the upper airway. The esophagus is air-filled.
 
 The lungs are well inflated and clear lungs. Aerated lung is seen extending
 inferiorly at the left costophrenic angle. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube at the level of the thoracic inlet and the upper airway.
 Consider advancing 1.5 cm for better positioning.
 2.  Aerated lung extending inferiorly down the left costophrenic angle.
 Although this is not a deep sulcus sign if clinical concern for pneumothorax
 consider upright or decubitus radiograph for further evaluation.
