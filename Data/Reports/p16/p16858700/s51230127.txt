                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aids, hodgkins on chemo, new fever  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC seen with tip in the RA SVC junction.  There has been interval
 resolution of the previously seen vascular congestion with mild edema.  There
 may be small pleural effusions.  There is retrocardiac opacity which
 silhouettes the medial hemidiaphragm the descending thoracic aorta.  Faint
 right basilar opacity is also noted with slight nodular component projecting
 over the posterior eighth rib.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm which certainly could
 represent infection.  More faint right basilar opacities with a somewhat
 nodular component which may correspond to disease seen on prior CT scan. 
 Consider PA and lateral for additional characterization.
