 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with substantial increase in pulmonary
 opacifications bilaterally.  This appearance is most suggestive of developing
 pulmonary edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude a superimposed consolidation, especially in the absence
 of a lateral view.
