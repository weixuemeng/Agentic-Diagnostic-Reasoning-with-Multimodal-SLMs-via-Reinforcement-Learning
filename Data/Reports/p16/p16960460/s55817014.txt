                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with possible history of asthma, now with
 cough, here to assess for evidence of asthma exacerbation or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior
 study.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged; however, an
 irregular distribution of the peripheral vasculature is noted which is
 consistent with COPD or asthma.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No skeletal
 abnormalities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Subtle irregular distribution
 of the peripheral pulmonary vasculature is consistent with COPD or asthma.
