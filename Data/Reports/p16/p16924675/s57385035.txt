                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 subtle patchy opacity projecting over the right upper lobe, difficult to
 discern whether it may have been subtly present on the prior study, concerning
 for focus of infection.  Recommend followup to resolution to exclude
 underlying lesion.  The remainder of the lungs is clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 A single-lead left-sided AICD is again seen, unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy right upper lobe opacity raises concern for focus
 of infection.  Recommend followup to resolution to exclude an underlying
 lesion.
