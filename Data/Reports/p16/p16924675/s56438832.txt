 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Suspected pneumonia.  History of alcohol abuse.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, ___ and ___.  Prior CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is similar mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A very vague
 opacity in the right upper lobe is not as distinctly visualized. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased small focal opacity in the right upper lobe.  Follow-up
 radiographs are recommended within eight weeks in order to show more complete
 evidence of resolution.
