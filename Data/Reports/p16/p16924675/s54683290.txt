 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:07 PM
  Findings suggest mild pulmonary vascular congestion and very small persistent
  right-sided free-flowing pleural effusion.  Also convex opacity in the right
  posterior costophrenic angle; considerations include sequelae of recent
  suspected pulmonary infarct or residual loculation of pleural effusion which
  has otherwise decreased.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___ and radiographs from the same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged, as before.  There is
 central prominence of pulmonary and interstitial vascularity including
 indistinct pulmonary vascularity, suggesting mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The lateral view depicts a convex opacity associated with the
 right posterior hemithorax, which is the site where moderate pleural effusion
 was present in the fairly recent past as well as posterior consolidative
 opacity.  This appearance may correspond to evolution of pulmonary infarction,
 as suspected previously, or a loculated pleural effusion.  A trace pleural
 effusion of more free flowing character is suggested along the right
 costophrenic sulcus on the frontal view.  Each major fissure is also slightly
 thickened, also suggesting fluid overload.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Convex opacity situated in the right posterior costophrenic sulcus. 
 Differential considerations include sequelae of recent suspected pulmonary
 infarct or a persistent loculated component of previously seen moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion, which has otherwise decreased substantially.
