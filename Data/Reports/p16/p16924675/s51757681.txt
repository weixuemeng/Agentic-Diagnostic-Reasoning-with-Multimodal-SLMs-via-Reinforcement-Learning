                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pain along the left ribs after altercation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  A CT torso was also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 no definite bony abnormality.  A pacemaker partly obscures the course of the
 lateral and anterior left third rib and this study does not constitute a
 complete rib series.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
