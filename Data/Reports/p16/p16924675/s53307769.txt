                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma to chest, now with syncope and chest pain in region of
 pacemaker, here to evaluate for rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position or appearance
 from the most recent prior study, with a single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle, unchanged.  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well
 aerated without focal airspace opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal
 in size, but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The trachea is midline.  There are healed right posterior lower rib
 fractures but no acute displaced rib fractures.  There is no free air beneath
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left pectoral pacemaker and single
 ventricular lead.  No pneumothorax or acute rib fractures.
