                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, possible ICD firing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
  :
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest was obtained.  There is a single lead left-sided AICD
 with lead in the expected position of the right ventricle, unchanged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately moderately enlarged, appears increased in
 size since the prior study, may in part relate to technique.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Previously noted medial right base opacity is still
 seen, but less apparent than on the prior study and most likely relates to
 vascular structures.  Findings could be better evaluated with PA and lateral
 views if patient able.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 evidence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
