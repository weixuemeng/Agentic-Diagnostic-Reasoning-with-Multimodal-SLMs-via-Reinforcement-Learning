                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is post-thyroidectomy. 
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  A cortical defect at the upper aspect of the sternum may represent
 a non-displaced fracture.  No overlying soft tissue swelling is seen.
 
 No rib fractures are detected, although this technique is not optimized for
 evaluation of osseous trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely upper sternal non-displaced fracture.  No pneumothorax.
