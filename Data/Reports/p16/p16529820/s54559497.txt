 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for acute process in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is subtle
 nodular retrocardiac opacity seen only on the lateral view which could
 indicate a very early lower lobe pneumonia.  Please note no definite
 consolidation on the frontal view is visualized.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structure is intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular retrocardiac opacity, which in the correct
 clinical setting could represent a lower lobe pneumonia.
