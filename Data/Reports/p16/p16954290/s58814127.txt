                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  A diffuse linear
 pattern in the mid and lower lungs is new from the prior radiograph and is
 accompanied by peribronchial cuffing and patchy peribronchiolar opacities
 particularly in the right infrahilar region.  Hyperlucency of upper lobes with
 associated attenuation of the vasculature is in keeping with
 upper-lobe-predominant emphysema.  There are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchial wall thickening and diffuse interstitial opacities
 probably represent an atypical pneumonia in the setting of fever.  An atypical
 distribution of pulmonary edema in the setting of upper lobe predominant
 emphysema is an additional consideration.
