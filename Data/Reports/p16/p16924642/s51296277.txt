                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia several weeks  // F/u bacteremic
 right middle lobe pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been substantial improvement in the right
 middle lobe pneumonia with still persistent opacity in partial atelectasis of
 right middle lobe. Reassessment in 4 weeks is recommended and if finding still
 persist, chest CT is required to exclude the possibility of post obstructing
 pneumonia
 
 Nodular opacities projecting over the left lower lung, most likely
 representing nipple. Next radiograph is to be done with nipple markers to
 exclude the possibility of pulmonary nodule
