 Inspiratory volumes are now lower, with atelectasis or other patchy opacity in

 minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  No frank consolidation is
 identified.  The mid and upper zones of both lungs are clear.  No effusion.

 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region with lower lung volumes --___
 atelectasis versus early pneumonic infiltrate.
