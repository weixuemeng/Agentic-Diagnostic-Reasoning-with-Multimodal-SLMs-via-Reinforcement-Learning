                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath with right flank pain, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low which limits the evaluation primarily in the lung bases.  There is
 subtle opacity in the lung bases which is most compatible with atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable, though the aorta is
 unfolded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar plate-like atelectasis without definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.
