                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, or earlier on the same day at
 09:02.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the exam earlier on the same day, bilateral parenchymal airspace
 opacities are more conspicuous and could suggest multifocal pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation.  There is probably also component of
 asymmetric edema, worse on the right.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Tortuous and/or
 ectatic thoracic aorta is unchanged. No pneumothorax.  Clips in the upper
 abdomen may be from cholecystectomy is such history exists.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval progression of bilateral parenchymal opacities which could
 represent worsening edema; however, multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical situation is possible.
 2. Persistent small right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
