                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with increasing DOE, ___ edema, c/f CHF  // eval ? edema,
 cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema which is new since
 prior.  More confluent opacities seen at the lung bases bilaterally.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely, though not particularly well assessed
 as 1 costophrenic angle is not included on the lateral view.  Cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged as on prior.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion with mild edema and probable
 small effusions.  Superimposed bibasilar opacities likely potentially
 atelectasis versus superimposed infection.  Recommend repeat after treatment.
