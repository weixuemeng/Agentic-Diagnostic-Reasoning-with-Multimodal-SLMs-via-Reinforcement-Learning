                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Available for comparison is
 the next preceding similar study of ___.  The patient has a known
 adenocarcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  Comparison is made during
 the present image evaluation.  On the frontal view, the densities surrounding
 the left-sided lung have increased and aeration of the remaining left lung is
 diminished resulting in a further mediastinal shift towards the left.
 
 In the right hemithorax, the already earlier visible multiple nodular
 densities indicative of secondary metastases have increased.  There is now
 also mild blunting of the right-sided lateral pleural sinus which was not
 present on the previous examination.  No pneumothorax can be identified on
 either side.  The position of the right-sided Port-A-Cath system advanced via
 the right internal jugular approach remains unchanged.  Heart size has not
 increased and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of left-sided lung masses, decreased aeration in left
 hemithorax, On the right side advanced evidence of secondary metastasis in
 lung, no pneumothorax, no massive pleural effusions that would deserve
 additional drainage.  A left-sided basal small caliber drainage tube is noted
 to be unchanged but poorly visible because of overlying pleural and
 parenchymal abnormalities.
