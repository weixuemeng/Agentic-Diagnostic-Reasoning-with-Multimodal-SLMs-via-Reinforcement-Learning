                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with lung adenocarcinoma
 and brain metastasis with left pleural effusion after Pleurx catheter,
 currently not draining.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the cavoatrial junction,
 unchanged.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Left
 upper lung opacity appears to be unchanged, representing known lung mass. 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules are redemonstrated.  The assessment of the left
 lung base demonstrates multiple air-fluid loculations that might be consistent
 with loculated air-fluid levels within the pleural effusion.  Overall, when
 compared to the prior study, there is mild interval increase of pleural
 effusion in the left hemithorax.  Small amount of right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
