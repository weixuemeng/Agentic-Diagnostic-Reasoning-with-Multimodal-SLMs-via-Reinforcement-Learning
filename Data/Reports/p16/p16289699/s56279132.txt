                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with congestive heart failure and renal failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right mid and lower lung consolidation appears increased compared to prior. 
 Moderate right pleural effusion persists.  The left costophrenic angle is
 incompletely imaged, but no large left pleural effusion is seen.  Left lung
 vascular congestion is seen.  Pacing and mediastinal hardware appears similar
 in position on this single frontal view.  Sternal wires appear intact.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable, with aortic
 calcifications.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right mid and lower lung consolidation, which could represent
 compressive atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusion, but pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
