                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Exudative right-sided pleural effusion tapped on ___ with
 persistent minimally productive cough.  Evaluation for reaccumulation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___ at 1:10 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no recurrence of the right pleural effusion nor is there a
 left pleural effusion.  A tiny linear density at the right apex may represent
 a small apical pneumothorax.  Left-sided pacer leads are in the standard
 position.  A median sternotomy wire and CABG clips are noted.  There is
 obscuration of the right heart border that most likely represents atelectasis
 in the right middle lobe though pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. 
 Cardiac size is within normal limits.
 
 The case was discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone
