                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and recent congestive heart failure.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are low, exaggerating the cardiac silhouette, which is mildly enlarged. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise stable.  Increased hazy opacity at
 the right lung base is compatible with an enlarged right pleural effusion, now
 moderate in size.  Adjacent linear opacities are compatible with atelectasis. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings is compatible with vascular
 congestion.  The wires of a atrio-biventricular left chest wall pacer
 terminates in similar position.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased size of a chronic right pleural effusion, now moderate, with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Unless the etiology of this abnormality is known and
 understood, CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 2.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette could represent a pericardial effusion.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on
 ___ at ___ AM.
