                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough and sputum. Possible right middle lobe
 atelectasis or pneumonia identified on prior chest radiograph.  Evaluation for
 evolution of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is continued obscuration of the right heart border consistent
 with right middle lobe atelectasis.  ___ in appearance when compared to
 ___ is likely due to diffence in lung volumes.    Biventricular pacer
 leads are in standard position.  Median sternotomy wires are noted.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The borders of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette are not well visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Persistent right middle lobe atelectasis, pneumonia is still a possibility.
