                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent area of right basilar
 consolidation or atelectasis remains unchanged.  Within the left lung,
 allowing for patient rotation, there are no new areas of consolidation to
 suggest the presence of pneumonia.  A vertically oriented interface in the
 periphery of the left lower lung, very likely represents a skin fold. 
 However, considering the history of left-sided chest pain, followup radiograph
 would be helpful to exclude an atypical manifestation of pneumothorax.  These
 results have been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:45 a.m., 1 hour after the time of discovery.
