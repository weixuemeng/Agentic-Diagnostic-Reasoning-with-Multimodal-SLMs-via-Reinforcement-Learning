                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Likely aspiration pneumonia, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube is barely visible on the image and appears to project over the middle
 parts of the stomach.  No evidence of complications.  The other monitoring and
 support devices are constant.  Constant large right-sided pleural effusion
 with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases.  Unchanged mild
 cardiomegaly.
