                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper right atrium, as before.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appears similar.  There is
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus which appears unchanged. 
 Correlating with the recent prior CT, there has been no definite change and
 this appearance seems to be due to scarring in the costophrenic sulcus rather
 than a pleural effusion.  The lungs appear clear.  Surgical clips project
 about the epigastrium.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
