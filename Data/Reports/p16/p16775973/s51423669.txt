                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer, on chemotherapy, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the costophrenic angles are more
 sharply seen, presumably related to the upright position of the patient.  The
 left central catheter has been removed.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or definite vascular congestion.
