 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable and lateral views of the chest are provided. 
 Plate-like lower lung atelectasis is noted bilaterally.  The heart appears
 mildly enlarged, but this could be technique-related.  No definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Mediastinal contour reflects
 an unfolded thoracic aorta, also seen on prior CT.  Anterior spurring is seen
 anteriorly in the thoracic spine.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung plate-like atelectasis.  No pneumonia.
