                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs. Slightly increased opacity in the right
 infrahilar region could represent an early pneumonia, although there is no
 definite correlate on the lateral view. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased opacity in the right infrahilar region, seen posteriorly
 projecting over the spine on lateral view, most likely  represents an early
 developing pneumonia.
