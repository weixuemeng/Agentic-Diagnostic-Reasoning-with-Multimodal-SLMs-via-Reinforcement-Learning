                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
 calcification of the arch.   The hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is
 no pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacity within the right lung base may
 reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 trace effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Numerous rib fractures are
 seen bilaterally which appear chronic.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, with a trace
 right pleural effusion.  Infection is not completely excluded.
