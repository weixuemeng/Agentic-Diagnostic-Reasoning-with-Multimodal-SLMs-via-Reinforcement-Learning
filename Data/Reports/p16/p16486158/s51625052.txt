                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 12:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.4
 cm from the carina.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged with
 the heart size top-normal.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures
 due to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, new in the interval.  No large
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
