                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is exaggerated by low lung
 volumes and AP projection, but probably top normal.  Tortuous aorta is
 redemonstrated.  Previous left basal atelectasis has coalesced into a smaller
 volume hugging the diaphragmatic surface since the prior study.  There is no
 evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
