                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dysphagia and the kidney.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is volume loss and opacity at both bases.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  The upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 It is unclear if there is merely lower lobe volume loss or if there could be
 an underlying infectious infiltrate.
