 pneumonia, effusions      eval for pneumonia, effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ and ___ at 2:53 a.m.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate what is probably moderate progression of both
 pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis.  It is not really
 possible to distinguish atelectasis from pneumonia at this point.  Pulmonary
 edema is probably not present.  The heart is not enlarged.  The stomach is now
 significantly distended with air and fluid
