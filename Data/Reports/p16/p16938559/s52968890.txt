                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thalamic hemorrhage fluctuating swallowing, increasing leukocytosis
 with concern for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low which exaggerates heart size and pulmonary
 vasculature.  There is no significant change compared to prior examination
 with redemonstration of perihilar haziness compatible with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no new focal
 consolidation worrisome for aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No significant change with redemonstration of mild pulmonary edema and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
