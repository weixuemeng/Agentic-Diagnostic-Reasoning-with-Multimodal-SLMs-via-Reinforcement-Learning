                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications have substantially cleared with some residual atelectatic
 changes, especially at the left base.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  No definite acute focal pneumonia
 or vascular congestion.
