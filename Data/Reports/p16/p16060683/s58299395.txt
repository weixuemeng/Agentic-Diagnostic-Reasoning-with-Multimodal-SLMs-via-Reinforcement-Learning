 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain with component of back pain, evaluation of the
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases
 are seen.  The symetry of the changes indicate atelectasis; however, pneumonia
 cannot be excluded with certainty.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  No
 pulmonary edema is present.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No mediastinal blunting or widening.  No
 apical cap.  No other findings suggestive of aortic disease.
