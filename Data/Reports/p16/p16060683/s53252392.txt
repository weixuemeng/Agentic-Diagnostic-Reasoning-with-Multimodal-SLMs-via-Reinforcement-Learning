                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with no overt pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities
 within the lung bases are progressed from prior and likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, slightly progressed compared to the prior exam.
