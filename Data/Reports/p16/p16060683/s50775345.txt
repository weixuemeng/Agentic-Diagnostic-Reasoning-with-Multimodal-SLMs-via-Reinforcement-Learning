  Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the proximal right
  subclavian vein and needs to be repositioned.  No pneumothorax.  New mild
  pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening bibasilar airspace opacities
  likely reflective of worsening atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left internal jugular central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:23.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate in
 the region of the proximal right subclavian vein.  Lung volumes are reduced
 compared to the previous exam.  There is now interval development of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion with a new vague opacity in the periphery of the
 mild right mid lung field.  Bibasilar airspace opacities persist, likely
 reflecting worsening atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  No large pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the proximal right
 subclavian vein and needs to be repositioned.  No pneumothorax.  New mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflective of worsening atelectasis.
