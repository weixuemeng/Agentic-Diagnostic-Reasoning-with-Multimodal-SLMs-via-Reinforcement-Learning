 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG and AVR, evaluate for

 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left basilar chest tube with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is patchy retrocardiac opacity which likely represents
 atelectasis in the setting of a small layering left effusion.  Lung volumes
 remain low and there continues to be some stable patchy atelectasis at the
 right base as well.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable
 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  No pulmonary edema.  Crowding
 of vasculature related to relatively low volumes.
