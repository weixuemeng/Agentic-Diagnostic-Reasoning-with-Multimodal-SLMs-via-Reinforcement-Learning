 Swan-Ganz catheter, and removal of the mediastinal drains and nasogastric
 tube.  Left basilar chest tube remains in place.  Lung volumes are diminished
 with patchy opacities at both bases and likely small associated effusions
 suggestive of compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
