                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of known pneumothorax,
 evaluate for interval decrease in size.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 previously seen right apical pneumothorax is slightly less conspicuous on the
 current study, likely due to overlapping structures/osseous structures, but
 likely persists.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax less conspicuous as compared to
 the prior study but likely still present.
