  Increased interstitial markings with some areas that appear nodular.  It is
  uncertain if this is due to vascular crowding and overlying osseous
  metastases, or given patient's history, the possibility of tiny pulmonary
  nodules from metastases.  Consider CT scan to further evaluate if desired.
  Diffuse osseous mets re-demonstrated, better seen on prior CT examination.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with ams
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There increased interstitial
 markings with possible nodular component seen throughout the lungs.  Is
 uncertain if this is due to combination of atelectasis given slightly low lung
 volumes and contribution from overlying known osseous metastases however
 possibility of tiny pulmonary nodules is also possible.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is present distal tip terminating
 overlying the right atrium.   Known diffuse osseous mets demonstrated as
 generalized increased sclerosis better seen on prior CT examination.
