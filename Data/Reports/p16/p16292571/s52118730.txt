                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of pleural effusion, EtOH cirrhosis s/p
 drainage p/w epigastric pain, radiates into chest and back.  // R/O pleural
 effusion, pneumonia, bowel obstruction
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary edema has improved since the prior exam. Diffusely nodular
 appearance of the lungs may represent vessels on end. There is a small
 residual right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
 Mild cardiomegaly mediastinal contours are stable. Left PICC extends to at
 least the left brachiocephalic vein but its tip is not well identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Multiple apparent nodules may
 represent vessels on end and if this appearance does not improve on subsequent
 radiographs, dedicated chest CT may be obtained.
 
 2.  Small residual right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Left PICC extends to at least the left brachiocephalic vein, but its tip
 is not well identified.
