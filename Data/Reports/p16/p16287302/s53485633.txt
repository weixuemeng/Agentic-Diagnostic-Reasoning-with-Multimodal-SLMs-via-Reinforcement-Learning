                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after ___ , after  removal
 of previous chest tubes and replacement of a new tube.
 
 AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right chest tube appears to be unchanged, with its tip projecting over the
 left pedicle of  T10, most likely at the very medial aspect of the posterior
 pleura.  Slight pulling back might be considered.  Fractured right clavicle is
 noted as well as on the prior study.  No substantial change in bibasal
 relatively small areas of atelectasis is noted.
