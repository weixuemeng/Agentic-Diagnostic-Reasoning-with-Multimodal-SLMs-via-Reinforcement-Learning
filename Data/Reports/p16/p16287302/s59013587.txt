                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAM:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post motor vehicle collision,
 now with right hemopneumothorax and right two to fifth rib fractures. 
 Reevaluate pneumothorax and rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position in
 wheelchair using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Available for comparison
 are the next preceding chest examinations of ___.  Right-sided
 clavicular fracture with significant foreshortening as before.  Scapula in
 unchanged position; however, local pleural thickenings are seen in the
 axillary area and along the right lateral chest wall apparently residuals
 since the preceding, with pleural effusion and hemothorax.  The lung is well
 aerated.  The right-sided diaphragm is mildly elevated and the lateral pleural
 sinuses still blunted.  No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are
 identified.  The previously on CT evaluated multiple rib fractures cannot be
 seen in detail on this standard chest examination.  Left hemithorax
 unremarkable.  No evidence of remaining free pleural effusion as both
 posterior pleural sinuses are free on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of post-traumatic pleural changes.  Unchanged position
 of previously described clavicular fracture.
