                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NGT placement after stroke  // NGT
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present --___ tip extends beneath the diaphragm to overlie the
 stomach.  A sideport if present, likely also overlies the stomach.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution with mild vascular
 plethora.  There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, improved compared
 with ___.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis the right base is
 also present.  The right costophrenic angle is obscured by overlying anatomy
 and lines.  No gross right effusion.  A small left effusion would be difficult
 to exclude no pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Partially imaged partially visualized posterior spinal fixation hardware is
 noted in the lumbar spine.  Residual oral contrast is seen in the colon in the
 descending colon, with scattered contrast filled diverticuli noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip overlies the stomach.
 
 Mild CHF --___ is similar, question slightly worse, compared 1 day earlier.
 
 Interval improvement in left lower lobe opacity, with some residual left base
 opacity noted.  Minimal atelectasis the right base is unchanged.  Probable
 small left effusion.  Small right effusion cannot be excluded, due to
 obscuration of the lower right chest wall and costophrenic angle.
