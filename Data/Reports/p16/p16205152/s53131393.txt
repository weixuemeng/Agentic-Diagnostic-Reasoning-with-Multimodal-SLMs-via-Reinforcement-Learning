                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position, with tip terminating approximately
 4.9 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is is demonstrated with tip above the
 gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced by approximately 10 cm. 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the region of the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. Right internal jugular
 central venous catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is present. The aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary edema. No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Focal opacity
 in the left upper lung field may reflect an area of infection or aspiration.
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  There are no
 displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal tube. Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.
 2. Suboptimal position of the enteric tube, with tip in the distal esophagus.
 Advancement by at least 10 cm is advised.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
 4. Focal opacity within the left upper lung field may reflect an area of
 infection or aspiration.
