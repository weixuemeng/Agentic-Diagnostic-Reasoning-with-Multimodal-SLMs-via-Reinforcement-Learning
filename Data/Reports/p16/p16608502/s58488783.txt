                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of low back pain,
 weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, consistent with COPD. 
 Bullous changes are seen at the lung apices bilaterally.  Opacity at the right
 suprahilar region, most likely correlates with known lung mass.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD, pulmonary emphysema.
 2.  Right suprahilar opacity most likely correlates with lung mass seen on
 prior CT, better evaluated on CT.
 3.  Please also note that patient had a sacral mass biopsy done on ___,
 which may be causing patient's lower back pain.
