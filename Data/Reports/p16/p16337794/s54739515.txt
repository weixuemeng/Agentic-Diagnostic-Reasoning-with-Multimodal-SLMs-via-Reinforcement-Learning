 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic diffuse pulmonary disease present since at least ___ when it
 was shown to be primarily bronchogenic and attributed to chronic aspiration
 may have subsequently developed a widespread interstitial component.  That has
 worsened relative to ___.  There is possibility of mild pulmonary
 edema, but heart size has never been large, and there is no mediastinal
