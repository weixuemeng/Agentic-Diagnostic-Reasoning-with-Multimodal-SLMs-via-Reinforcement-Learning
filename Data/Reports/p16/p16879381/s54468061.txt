                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe mass, bronchoscopy, biopsy, evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pneumothorax after biopsy.  Minimal increase in right upper lobe
 density is due to hemorrhage after the biopsy.  The remaining of the lung is
 unremarkable except for hyperinflation due to emphysema.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pneumothorax after biopsy.
 
 2.  Slight increase in right upper lobe opacities could be due to minimal
 hemorrhage after procedure.
