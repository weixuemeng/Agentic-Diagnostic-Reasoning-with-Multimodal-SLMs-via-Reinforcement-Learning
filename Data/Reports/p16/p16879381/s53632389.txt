                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after a bronch on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The irregular area of peribronchial infiltration
 and mass-like consolidation in the suprahilar right lung apex is no larger
 than it was on ___ and could be less extensive peripherally, but
 conventional chest radiograph is really not adequate to assess interval
 change.  Lower lungs are grossly clear, but hyperinflated.  Heart size normal.
 No evidence of central adenopathy.
