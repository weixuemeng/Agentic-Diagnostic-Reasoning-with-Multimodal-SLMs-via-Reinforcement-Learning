 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New brain cystic lesions, questionable lung lesions.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are no comparisons available at the time of dictation.  The
 most remarkable finding is a soft tissue density at least 3 x 7 cm mass in
 paramediastinal right-sided location.  In addition, there is mild enlargement
 of the right hilar structures and at the bases of the right lung, at least one
 nodular structure with the diameter of 1.3 x 1.5 cm is seen.  Overall, the
 findings are strongly suggestive of advanced neoplastic right lung disease.
 
 There are no pathological changes in the left lung.  No pleural effusions. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
