 pleural fluid has increased since ___, but is similar to ___ with
 fluid in the right major fissure and small adjacent atelectasis. A left
 pleural effusion is tiny. A calcified granuloma is seen in the right mid lung.
 Right apical thickeing is similar. There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are
 stable with mild cardiomegaly.  A catheter projects over the right
 hemiabdomen, presumably the cholecystostomy tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, are increased
 since ___.
