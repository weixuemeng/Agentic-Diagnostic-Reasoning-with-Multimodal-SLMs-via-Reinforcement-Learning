                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain, dyspnea.  Evaluate for widened mediastinum,
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal and not significantly changed since prior examination.  As
 compared to prior chest radiograph, there has been interval resolution of
 right lower lung opacity and pleural fluid.  Atelectasis and probable small
 pleural effusion still remains.  No pneumothorax identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement of right lower lung opacity, with probable residual
 atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  No new focal abnormalities to suggest
 pneumonia identified.
