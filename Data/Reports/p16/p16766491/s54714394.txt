                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided pleural thickening with associated right-sided volume
 loss appears similar, suggesting chronic fibrothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Increased opacity with associated dilated
 airways in the right lower lobe appears similar to the prior radiograph, and
 areas of parenchymal scarring at the right apex also appear similar with
 associated bronchiectasis.  No new areas of lung consolidation are evident,
 and there is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic right pleural thickening is similar to ___
 chest radiograph.  Chronic bronchiectasis and volume loss in adjacent right
 lower lobe, for which superimposed infection is difficult to exclude
 radiographically.
