                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with malignant right pleural effusion after PleurX
 catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small volume of right pleural effusion remains, in the vicinity of a coiled
 right basal pleural catheter.  Edema or atelectasis at the base of the right
 lung, as well as local pneumothorax has improved with the decrease in pleural
 fluid volume.  Right apical pleural thickening is chronic, but nodulation of
 thickened right pleura at the level of the scapula, laterally, is more
 pronounced, probably due to malignant pleural implants.  
 
 A triangular region of opacification in the right lung, in the middle lobe
 projecting over the hilus on the frontal view is new.  Whether this is
 infection or atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate.  Aside from severe
 overinflation due to emphysema, the left lung is unremarkable. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
