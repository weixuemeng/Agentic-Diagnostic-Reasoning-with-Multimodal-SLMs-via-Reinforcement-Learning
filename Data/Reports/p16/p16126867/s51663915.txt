                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with
 pleural biopsy and placement of indwelling pleural catheter for malignant
 pleural effusion from metastatic lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, ___, chest radiographs, ___
 through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A subtle roughly 2-cm
 nodular density overlies the inferior margin of the right hilus, visible on
 lateral projection, projecting over the heart is suspicious for lung nodule
 which was not clearly visible on prior CT due to compression from large
 malignant effusion.  A right pleural drainage catheter remains in place with a
 small amount of remnant right pleural effusion.  Nodular thickening of the
 right apical pleura is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. The left lung is
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in examination compared to ___ with
 persistent small right effusion with pleural drainage catheter in place, right
 apical nodular pleural thickening, and 2-cm right middle lobe nodule.
