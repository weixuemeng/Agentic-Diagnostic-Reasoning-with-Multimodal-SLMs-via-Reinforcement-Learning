 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged; however,
 there are no findings of heart failure.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Patchy opacities are seen at the left
 lung base and are unchanged, likely representing atelectasis.  Mediastinal
 contours and sternotomy wires are unchanged.
