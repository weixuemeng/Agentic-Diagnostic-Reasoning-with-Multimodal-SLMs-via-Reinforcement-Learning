                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite
 pneumothorax.  Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
 without appreciable vascular congestion, raising the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions with atelectatic changes at the bases.
