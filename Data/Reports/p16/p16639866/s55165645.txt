                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior study from approximately one hour earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was provided.  There has been
 interval placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip located approximately
 1.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Scattered bilateral lung opacities appear less confluent compared with prior
 exam and may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low position of the endotracheal tube positioned 1.7 cm above the
 carina.  Recommend retraction by at least 1 cm for more optimal positioning. 
 Lower lung opacities concerning for atelectasis and/or aspiration.
