 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post esophagectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 Again seen is persistent moderate-sized left-sided pneumothorax.  There is no
 pneumothorax seen on the right side.  There is a chest tube seen at the right
 lung base.  There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the
 proximal SVC.  An esophageal stent is identified and unchanged since prior. 
 There is some increase in the pulmonary interstitial markings since the
 previous study suggestive of some mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Hazy
 densities are seen at the lung bases that may represent developing infiltrate
 versus atelectasis.
