                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of an esophageal stent, with no
 evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Unchanged widening of the
 right mediastinal contours corresponding to esophagogastrectomy changes.  The
 volume of the right hemithorax remains reduced compared to the left, and
 smoothly marginated partially calcified right pleural thickening remains
 unchanged, suggesting fibrothorax.  Additionally, there is a small amount of
 pleural fluid within the fissures on the right.  Left lung is slightly
 hyperexpanded but grossly clear.  Healed right rib fractures may be
 posttraumatic or post-operative in etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post removal of esophageal stent with no evidence of
 pneumomediastinum or acute pulmonary abnormalities.
