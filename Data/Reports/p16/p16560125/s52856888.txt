 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Empyema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Esophageal stent is in unchanged position.  Unchanged position of the
 right chest tube.  The left PICC line has been removed and replaced by a right
 PICC line.  The extensive right parenchymal and pleural opacities are
 constant.  On the left, there is newly appeared minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sinus, potentially suggestive of minimal left pleural effusion. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is constant.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.
