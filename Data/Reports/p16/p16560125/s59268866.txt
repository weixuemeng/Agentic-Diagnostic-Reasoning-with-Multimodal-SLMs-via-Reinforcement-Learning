                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New wheezes, thick sputum.  Evaluate for infectious process,
 effusion, or pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An esophageal stent is in unchanged position.  A right chest tube is in
 unchanged position.  The right PICC line has retracted somewhat now ending in
 the right subclavian vein.  There has been interval worsening of bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is larger compared to prior. 
 Worsening bilateral interstitial opacification is consistent with pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing cardiomegaly and pleural
 effusions consistent with congestive heart failure.
 
 2. Right PICC line has retracted now ending in the right subclavian vein.
