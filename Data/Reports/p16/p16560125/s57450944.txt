 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post atomic repair following leak after
 esophagogastrectomy, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube, the
 right central venous access line, as well as the three chest tube and the left
 pleural pigtail catheter are in unchanged position.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The neoesophagus and the right upper mediastinum show normal
 post-surgical appearance.  Overall, the lung volumes have decreased, which, in
 turn, leads to an increase in density of the lung parenchyma, notably at the
 right lung bases and in the upper left perihilar areas.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged appearance of the right thoracic staple line.
