                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ at 15:42.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with signs of anastomotic leak, status post
 esophagogastrectomy, evaluate for an acute process.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 15:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There
 is a nasogastric tube that descends to the level of the upper esophagus and
 then heads superiorly with the tip not identified.  Repositioning is advised. 
 A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  Two
 right-sided chest tubes are in place.  
 
 2.  There is retrocardiac consolidation, likely representing left lower lobe
 collapse.  There is likely a left effusion and a smaller right effusion. 
 Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base likely is related to recent
 esophagogastrectomy.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given supine technique.  Multiple
 surgical clips are seen within the epigastric region and left upper quadrant. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 Results of this examination were conveyed by phone to Dr. ___ at
 ___ at 4:12 p.m. at the time of discovery.
