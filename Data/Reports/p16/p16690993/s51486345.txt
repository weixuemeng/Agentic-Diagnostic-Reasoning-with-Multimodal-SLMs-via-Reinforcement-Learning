                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACS at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral pleural effusions are probably moderate in
 size with likely adjacent relaxation atelectasis.  Concurrent pneumonia in the
 lower lobes cannot be completely excluded in the appropriate clinical
 situation, difficult to assess on this exam in the setting of effusions.  The
 heart size is difficult to assess in the setting of these pleural effusions,
 however heart size is probably top normal.  No frank pulmonary edema.  Aortic
 knob calcifications are mild.  Left shoulder replacement is partially imaged. 
 Bilateral mild degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 Multi-level degenerative changes of thoracic spine are moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral moderate pleural effusions and probable
 relaxation atelectasis.  Concurrent pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in
 the appropriate clinical situation.
