                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis,
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Clips in the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen indicate prior cholecystectomy.  Nipple piercings are noted
 within the breasts bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, in the setting of low
 lung volumes.
