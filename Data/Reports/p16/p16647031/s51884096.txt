                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 The pulmonary vascularity is less engorged, though this could merely reflect
 the upright PA projection.
