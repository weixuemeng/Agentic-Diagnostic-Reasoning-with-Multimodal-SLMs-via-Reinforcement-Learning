                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M on dialysis, found down, unresponsive. Unclear
 mechanism. Fall vs syncope vs collapse.  // CXR: s/p intubation, assess for
 infiltrate, ETT position.CT Head/Cspine: assess for traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is somewhat limited by overlying trauma board. An endotracheal tube
 terminates 2.3 cm above the level of the carina. And oral gastric tube is seen
 terminating within the stomach. A left-sided central venous line terminates
 near the cavoatrial junction. There is a dual lead left pectoral pacemaker
 noted. Surgical clips are noted within the right upper abdomen. A vascular
 stent overlies the right upper lobe. The left lung is nearly completely
 opacified, obscuring the left cardiac border and left hemidiaphragm. A left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  A vague opacity overlies the left lung
 apex, potentially concerning for underlying aortic injury. The right lung
 demonstrates mild basilar atelectasis and is otherwise grossly clear. There is
 no right pleural effusion. Heavy atherosclerotic calcification is seen within
 the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Focal opacity within the left apical lung. Findings are concerning for
 aortic injury in the setting of trauma, and CTA chest is recommended for
 further characterization.
 2.  ET tube terminating 2.3 cm above the carina.
 3.  Near-complete left lung opacification may be secondary to collapse or
 dense consolidation. Left pleural effusion is not excluded.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ pager at
 7:35 on ___.
