                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:23 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Recent cardiac arrest and C-spine fracture.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Although the right hemithorax is hyperlucent, I do not see the pleural edge of
 a pneumothorax and the appearance could be due to emphysema and air trapping. 
 If patient can tolerate an upright view that would be helpful in increasing my
 level of certainty that there is no pneumothorax.  Leftward mediastinal shift
 and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggests that the opacification in the
 left lower lobe has a large component of atelectasis as well as possible
 pneumonia.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric feeding tube passes
 into the stomach and out of view.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
