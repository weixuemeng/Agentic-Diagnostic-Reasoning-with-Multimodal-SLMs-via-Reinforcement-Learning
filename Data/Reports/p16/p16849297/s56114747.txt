                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATIONS:  ___-year-old man who is status post C5-C6 laminectomy and C4-T1
 posterior fusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph from ___, bilateral lower lung
 opacities which are from a combination of mild-to-moderate pleural effusion
 and accompanying atelectasis have not really changed much.  On the left side,
 at least a small component of this effusion appears to be loculated.  Since
 the patient is rotated, the assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette was
 further limited.  Upper lungs are clear.  A feeding tube courses below the
 diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off the radiographic
 view.  fixation device in the cervical spine regions is seen.
