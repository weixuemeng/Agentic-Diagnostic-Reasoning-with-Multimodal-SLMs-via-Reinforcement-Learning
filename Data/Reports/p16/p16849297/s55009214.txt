 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, decreased breath sounds, evaluation for
 abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is overall clear
 overinflation of the lungs.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in
 unchanged position.  Unchanged left basal predominantly atelectatic opacity. 
 The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given that
 the left hilus is not included in the image.  On the right, there are the
 known scars at the lung bases but no new parenchymal opacity that would
 suggest pneumonia.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
