                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiogenic shock.Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:05 a.m.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Compared with the prior film, the overall appearance is
 quite similar.  Possible slight increase in the confluence of opacity in the
 left mid zone.  Again seen are patchy alveolar opacities in both lungs in a
 perihilar distribution, most suggestive of CHF.  There is a small right
 effusion.  There is some patchy increased retrocardiac density, consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation which is unchanged. 
 Sternal wires, mediastinal clips, and additional clips in the upper abdomen
 are again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.no pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema and
 small right effusion are essentially unchanged.  Possible slight increase in
 the confluence of opacity in the left mid zone.
