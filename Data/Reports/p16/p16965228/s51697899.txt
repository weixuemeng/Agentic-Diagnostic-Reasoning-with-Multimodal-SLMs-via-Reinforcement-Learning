 thoracic spine may reflect a subtle left lower lobe pneumonia. There is no
 pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour
 appears normal. Imaged bony structures appear intact. No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm. A focal eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 incidentally noted.
