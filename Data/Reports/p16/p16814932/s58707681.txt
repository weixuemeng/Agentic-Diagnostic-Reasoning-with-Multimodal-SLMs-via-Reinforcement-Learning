 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient still has very
 low lung volumes and a moderate cardiomegaly.  The diameter of the vascular
 structures is at the upper range of normal, potentially suggesting mild fluid
 overload.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No larger pleural effusions.
