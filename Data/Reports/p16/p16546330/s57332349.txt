                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the
 heart size mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low with linear and streaky
 opacities in the lung bases, most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
