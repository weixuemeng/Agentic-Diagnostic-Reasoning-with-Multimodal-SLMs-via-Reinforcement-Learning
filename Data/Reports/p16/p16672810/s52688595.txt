                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains within normal
 limits.  The configuration suggests a relative prominence of the left
 ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly which in conjunction with the
 generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the possibility of
 systemic hypertension.  There is, however, no evidence of significant
 pulmonary vascular congestion and no acute pulmonary infiltrates can be
 identified.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  The on previous
 examination existing small left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis has
 normalized.  Also the on previous examinations seen wide-caliber dialysis
 catheter,entered via the right internal jugular approach, has been removed. 
 No pneumothorax has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiac findings, elongated and widened thoracic aorta in
 elderly gentleman. No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or CHF as
 previously existing pleural effusions have disappeared.
