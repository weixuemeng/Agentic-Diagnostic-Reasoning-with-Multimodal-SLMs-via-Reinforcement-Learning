 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New leukocytosis, evaluation for consolidation or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Low lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload
 but without focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  No larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
