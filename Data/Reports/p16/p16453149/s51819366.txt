                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 22:46
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia, fluid overload, question PE.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 11:16.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 22:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be bilateral patchy airspace disease with associated
 Kerley lines and indistinctness of  pulmonary vasculature.  These findings are
 most consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia
 should also be considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Small layering bilateral effusions. 
 Superior displacement of right proximal humerus with narrowing of the
 acromiohumeral distance suggestive of chronic rotator cuff tear and associated
 degenerative changes.  No acute bony abnormality.  Overall, there is no
 significant interval change since the prior study.
