 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple AP, portable views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is status post intubation, and the ETT placement was
 adjusted between the first and second radiographs. On the second radiograph,
 the ET tube is seen terminating 2.7 cm above the level of the carina.  An
 orogastric tube is noted coursing into the stomach and out of view of the
 radiograph.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema identified.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is S-shaped
 scoliosis is seen within the mid thoracic spine.  No acute bony abnormality is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities likely represent atelectasis,
 although infection cannot be entirely excluded. 
 
 2.  ETT terminating 2.7 cm above the carina.
