                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress, edema versus
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest are submitted from ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar
 airspace opacity, most likely representing compressive atelectasis.  Overall,
 the perihilar edema is improving, but there is still residual interstitial
 edema.  Superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  The right humeral head
 remains superiorly displaced and there is complete obliteration of the
 acromiohumeral distance consistent with a chronic rotator cuff injury.  No
 pneumothorax.
