                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some increase in the
 degree of pleural effusion on the left.  Elliptical opacification is
 consistent with loculated effusion and the major fissure.  The right lung is
 essentially clear.
 
 Impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea suggests a thyroid
 enlargement.
