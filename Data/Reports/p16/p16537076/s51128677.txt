                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 opacification at the left base consistent with pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis.  Some shift of the trachea to the left is consistent
 with right thyroid nodule seen previously.  The right lung is essentially
 clear and there is no definite vascular congestion.
