                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weight loss, elevated white count and liver function tests.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There is enlargement of the right
 hilum suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy.  Multiple nodules are
 demonstrated throughout both lungs, the largest within the right lung base
 measuring 2.5 cm.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
 is present.  There is likely minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic
 disease.  Right hilar enlargement suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy. 
 CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
