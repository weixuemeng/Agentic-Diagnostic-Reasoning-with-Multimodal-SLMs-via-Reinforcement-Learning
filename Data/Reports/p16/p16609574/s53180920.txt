 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are streaky
 bibasilar opacities.  Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle is seen,
 potentially atelectasis.  Posterior costophrenic angles are sharp without
 definite evidence of effusion.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, noting
 that infection cannot be entirely excluded.
