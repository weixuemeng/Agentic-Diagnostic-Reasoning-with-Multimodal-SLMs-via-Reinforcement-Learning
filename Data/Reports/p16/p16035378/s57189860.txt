                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a zone of increased
 parenchymal density at the bases of the right upper lobe, seen better on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The change could be reflecting
 resolving pneumonia, based on the slight deviation of the minor fissure, the
 change is very likely not recent.  A nodular opacity adjacent to this change,
 projecting over the posterior aspect of the tenth rib is likely to represent a
 vessel but should be re-evaluated radiographically in 6 or 8 weeks, of the
 therapy for the right upper lobe process. Minimal atelectasis at the right
 lung bases.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  At the time of dictation an entry was made in the radiology
 dashboard.
