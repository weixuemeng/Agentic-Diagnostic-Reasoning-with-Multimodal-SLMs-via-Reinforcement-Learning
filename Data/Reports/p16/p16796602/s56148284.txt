                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with severe R sided pleuritic chest pain  // PTX? infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  There is focal linear opacities likely atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  More subtle peripheral opacity at the right lung base
 laterally on the frontal view is also noted.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear opacity at the right lung base likely atelectasis.
 More peripheral, pleural-based parenchymal opacity at the right lung base
 laterally.  Given clinical symptoms, CTA should be considered to evaluate for
 possible underlying infarct in the setting of pulmonary embolus.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___.
