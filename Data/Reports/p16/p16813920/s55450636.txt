  radiographically will be necessary.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is subtle opacity projecting over the left lower lung, overlying the
 posterior left ninth rib.  There is no definite correlate on the lateral
 although perhaps muscle mild increased density in the infrahilar region when
 compared to priors.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.   There is no effusion,
 other region of consolidation or edema.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague left lower lung opacity with possible but no definite correlate on the
 lateral.  This could represent infection in the proper clinical setting. 
 Clinical correlation will be necessary and follow-up to document clearance
 radiographically will be necessary.
