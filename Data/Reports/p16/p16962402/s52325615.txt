                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, decreased
 breath sounds at bases, questionable pleural effusion, evaluate for
 parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy, consistent with a history of
 previous mitral valve replacement surgery.
 
 In comparison with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___, the heart size appears stable.  The pulmonary vasculature does not
 demonstrate increased congestive pattern.  Also, the at that time existing
 bilateral pleural effusions have regressed.  The lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are practically free from any significant pleural effusion.  No new
 parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  In comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___, no significant interval change can be
 identified.  Comparison is also extended to the preoperative chest examination
 of ___.  This comparison demonstrates a mild increase of the heart
 silhouette which is not uncommon postoperatively.  As before, the patient has
 marked left atrial enlargement well identified on the lateral views. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestive pattern, however, has not changed significantly
 and remains mild, if any.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified.
