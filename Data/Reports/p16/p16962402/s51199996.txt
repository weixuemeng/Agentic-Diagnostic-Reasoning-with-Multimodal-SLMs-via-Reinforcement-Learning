                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve repair
 for assessment of pleural effusions.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Heart size is unchanged since the
 prior studies.  Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.  Small amount of
 bilateral pleural effusion is seen.  No definitive pneumothorax is noted at
 the apices.  Anterior pleural hydropneumothorax is noted, better appreciated
 on the lateral view.
