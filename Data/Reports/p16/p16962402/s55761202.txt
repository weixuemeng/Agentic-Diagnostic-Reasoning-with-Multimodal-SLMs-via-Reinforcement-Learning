 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dropping hematocrit.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been removed.  The patient has also been extubated and the nasogastric tube
 has been removed.  A right chest tube as well as a mediastinal drain and a
 venous introduction sheath are in situ.
 
 After extubation, the lung volumes have decreased, with newly appeared
 bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  A coexisting small left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
