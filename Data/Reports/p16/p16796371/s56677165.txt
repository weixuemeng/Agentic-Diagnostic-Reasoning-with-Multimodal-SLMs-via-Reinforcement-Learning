                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation. Assess tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates ___ gastric tube
 coursing midline with tip in stomach, and side port just below the level of
 the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 2.8 cm above the
 level of the carina.
 
 The film is rotated. The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.
 Heterogeneous left perihilar and right lung base opacities are noted. No
 pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are limited in
 evaluation and grossly unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment upper abdomen is within normal limits. VP shunt tubing
 projects over the right hemi thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left perihilar opacity and right lung base opacities worrisome for
 aspiration pneumonia.
 2.  Nasogastric tube side port is just below level of diaphragm. Consider
 advancing 5-10 cm for better positioning.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 8:20 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
