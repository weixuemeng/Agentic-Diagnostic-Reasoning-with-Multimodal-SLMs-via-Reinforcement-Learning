                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman, intubated, ngt malpositioned on last scan  //
 interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.2 cm above the
 carina. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the cavoatrial junction.
 VP shunt noted.
 
 An NG tube is present.  The configuration appears similar to the prior film,
 with extension meets the diaphragm, a hairpin curve below the edge of the
 film, and the tip overlying the gastric fundus.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.
 
 There is more confluent hazy opacity in the right mid and lower zones compared
 to the prior film. Faint hazy opacity in the retrocardiac region is again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NG tube configuration similar prior.
 2. Hazy opacity at right base/ middle zone has a progressed. Patchy opacity at
 the left base is also again noted. The differential diagnosis includes
 collapse and/or consolidation. In the appropriate clinical setting, aspiration
 pneumonitis could have a similar appearance.
