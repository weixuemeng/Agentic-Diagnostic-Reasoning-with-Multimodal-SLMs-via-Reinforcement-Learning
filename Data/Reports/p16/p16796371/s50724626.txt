 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with seizures in setting of old TBI, now fever 
 // focal lung findings      focal lung findings
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ and
 second ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Because the patient is not properly positioned, I cannot assess the severity
 of leftward mediastinal shift .  This is important because there is new
 consolidation in the left lower lobe and if there is appreciable leftward
 mediastinal shift and some or all of the consolidation is due to collapse.  If
 there is minimal or no shift, it is more likely pneumonia.  There is new mild
 atelectasis at the right base as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Heart size is normal.  Upper lungs are clear.
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements.  A shunt catheter
 traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen.  Nasogastric drainage tube
 is looped in the nondistended stomach.  There is no pneumothorax.
