 neuro exam poor.   // Evaluate lung fields     Evaluate lung fields
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New almost uniform opacification in the mid and lower left hemithorax is
 probably a combination of moderate pleural effusion and left lower lobe
 collapse.  There is a large irregular radiopacity projecting over the right
 upper lobe, from the mediastinum to the lateral chest wall, much of which is
 artifact from external connectors.  Nevertheless there may be new right upper
 lobe atelectasis or consolidated.  I recommend repeat chest radiograph with
 careful attention to removing all external devices.
 ET tube is in standard position, given the severe flexion of the chin. 
 Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Left subclavian line ends in the upper
 right atrium.  Shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper
 abdomen.
