                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Agitation and confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 again mildly prominent.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Streaky right infrahilar opacity is similar and appears most suggestive of
 atelectasis associated with large epicardial fat pad, seen on the prior CT. 
 Smooth opacity also appears similar in the left costophrenic sulcus.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  An old right posterolateral sixth rib fracture appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of persistent scarring or atelectasis at
 the lung bases, with a possible small left-sided pleural effusion.
