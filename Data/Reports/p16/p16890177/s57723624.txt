                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with strep pneumo bacteremia, meningitis, and
 PNA, recently drained pleural effusions  // eval pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, a left chest tube is
 been. Small left apical pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size, but there
 is probably a basilar hydro pneumothorax component present as well, difficult
 to quantify on this semi upright radiograph. Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 worsening bibasilar atelectasis and persistent small right pleural effusion.
