                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left-sided rib pain, cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a very
 subtle somewhat rounded opacity in the right mid lung which could represent a
 very early focus of pneumonia.  Otherwise, lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax
 or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No displaced fracture
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung could represent pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution to exclude underlying mass.
