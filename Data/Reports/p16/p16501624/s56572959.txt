                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with diverticulitis, mesenteric phlebitis,
 status post liver biopsy with altered mental status and tachypnea, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC. 
 The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed.  Lung volumes
 remain low with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 There has been interval improvement in the mild pulmonary edema, but
 persistent crowding of the vasculature.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No
 large effusions are seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess given the marked low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacity most likely still reflects patchy atelectasis, although a developing
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.
