                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spontaneous recurrent pneumothoraces s/p
 CT-guided drainage  // interval change     interval change, ?placement of CT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is been placement of a right
 pigtail catheter with apparent drainage of 1 of the large loculated
 collections of hydro pneumothorax posteriorly.  However, the large air-fluid
 levels in the upper right lung anteriorly and posteriorly are unchanged.
 Again there is opacification in the lower right hemithorax consistent with
 pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.  The left lung remains
 essentially clear, and calcified plaque is again seen the base on the side.
