                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for right pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change in the degree of right apical pneumothorax despite the presence of two
 chest tubes.  The subcutaneous gas along the chest wall appears to be stable. 
 Left lung is essentially clear except for atelectatic changes at the bases.
