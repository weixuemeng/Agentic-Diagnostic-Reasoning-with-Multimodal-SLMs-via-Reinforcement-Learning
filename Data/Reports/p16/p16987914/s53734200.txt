                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dislodged pigtail catheter.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The previously seen right-sided chest pigtail catheter is no longer seen. 
 Small to moderate right pneumothorax persists, difficult to accurately assess
 change in size given lack of recent lateral view however, there is concern
 that it may be slightly increased in size.  Right basilar opacities again seen
 likely due to atelectasis.  There is persistent blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely due to small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 opacities are again seen suggestive of atelectasis.  Bilateral calcified
 pleural plaques for better assessed on the prior chest CT from ___
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left pigtail lower right chest catheter no longer seen.  Persistent right
 pneumothorax which may be slightly larger, difficult to truly discern change
 due to lack of lateral view on recent priors.
 
 The ED is aware of right pneumothorax as of 11AM on ___.
