                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with recent diagnosis mesothelioma, pt with previous
 opneumothorax, c/o increased dyspnea.  // r/o pneumothorax, r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multiple air-fluid levels on the right hemi thorax compatible
 with loculated hydropneumothoraces.  These regions appear more fluid-filled
 when compared to prior.  Dense consolidation seen at the right lung base is in
 part due to effusion and underlying atelectasis, consolidation/tumor.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  Calcified pleural plaque is identified.  Cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged noting silhouetting on the right as on prior. 
 Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is noted.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent loculated hydro pneumothoraces on the right with multiple pockets
 continually filling with fluid when compared to prior.  Right basilar opacity
 due to a components of fluid, consolidation, and tumor.
