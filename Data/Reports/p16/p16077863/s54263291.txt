                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman status post coronary artery bypass graft
 and chest tubes discontinued.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube,
 nasogastric tube and mediastinal drain/chest tubes have been removed.  Right
 IJ catheter is in unchanged position.  Lung volumes are slightly lower than
 the previous examination with increased left basilar opacity, likely at least
 in part due to atelectasis and effusion. However, increased haziness in the
 left base may be due to aspiration.  Mild pulmonary edema appears to be
 slightly improved.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Right IJ catheter in unchanged
 satisfactory position.  Heart remains mildly enlarged. Right upper lung nodule
 again demonstrated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Increased left basal opacity is due to left basal atelectasis and effusion;
 however, aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 2. Unchanged right upper lung nodule for which outpatient CT remains
 recommended.
