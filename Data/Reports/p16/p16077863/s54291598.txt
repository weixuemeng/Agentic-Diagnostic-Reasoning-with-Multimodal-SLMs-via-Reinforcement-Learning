 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CABG.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Left lower lobe opacities have improved consistent with improving atelectasis
 and pleural effusion.  Still there are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 larger on the left side.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Vascular
 congestion has resolved.
