                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
 There is also a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, including a large hiatal hernia.  Aside from
 streaky atelectasis associated with hernia, the lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, but probably attributable to atelectasis
 associated with a large hiatal hernia; no definite interval change.
