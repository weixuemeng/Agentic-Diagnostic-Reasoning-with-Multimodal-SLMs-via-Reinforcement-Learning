                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including exams performed on ___, ___, ___, and ___.  CTA of the
 chest on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  The left lung demonstrates some
 linear basilar opacities suggesting discoid atelectasis.  An ill-defined
 opacity in the right lung base is not significantly changed compared with
 prior exam on ___, and might represent an area of atelectasis or
 scarring.  This area of ill-defined opacity was also present on ___.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is again seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  A
 prosthetic aortic valve  is unchanged in position.  Dual lead pacemaker is
 noted in the left chest with leads ending in expected position in the right
 atrium and ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
