                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right lateral rib pain status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Linear bibasilar opacities are
 most suggestive of atelectasis.  There may be trace bilateral effusions.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting
 prosthetic aortic valve and median sternotomy wires.  Left chest wall
 dual-lead pacing device is again identified.  Anterior right sixth and seventh
 rib deformities suggest prior fracture and were present on prior.  There is no
 visualized acute fracture based on these non-dedicated films.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  If desired, dedicated
 rib series can be performed for more detailed evaluation of the ribs.
