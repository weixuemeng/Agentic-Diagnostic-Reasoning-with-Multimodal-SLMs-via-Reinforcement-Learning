                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve surgery,
 and CoreValve placement.  The appearance of the CoreValve is similar to the
 prior post-procedural radiograph.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are remarkable for tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and a large
 hiatal hernia.  Patchy and linear opacities are present at the lung bases, and
 note is made of small pleural effusions bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities are most suggestive of atelectasis, but followup
 radiographs may be helpful to exclude coexisting pneumonia or aspiration in
 the right lower lobe.
 
 2.  Small pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Large hiatal hernia.
