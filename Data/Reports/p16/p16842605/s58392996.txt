 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement surgery.  A
 dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has the leads terminating in the right atrium
 and ventricle, respectively.  A moderate to large hiatal hernia is noted
 although better seen on the prior examination, probably unchanged.  Associated
 streaky opacities at the left lung base suggeste minor associated atelectasis.
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes
 are similar along the lower thoracic spine.  There is a similar mild biconcave
 compression deformity along a few lower thoracic vertebral bodies, probably
 associated with bony demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Moderate to large hiatal hernia.
