 FINDINGS:
 
 The left costophrenic angle and left lateral chest are excluded from the field
 of view.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and Core aortic valve
 replacement.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle is re- demonstrated.  The heart size
 remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with a moderate size hiatal hernia re- demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 large right pleural effusion is seen, and assessment for left pleural effusion
 is limited.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Moderate hiatal hernia.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Exclusion
