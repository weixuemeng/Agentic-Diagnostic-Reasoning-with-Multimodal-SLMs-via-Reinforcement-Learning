                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are slightly low in volume but in total clear aside from linear left basilar
 and hazy right basilar opacities, in total, unchanged from multiple previous
 examinations.  Opacity on the lateral is likely due to large hiatal hernia. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size
 with tortuous aortic contour.  Dual lead pacemaker, median sternotomy wires
 and valvular prosthesis are demonstrated. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  Large hiatal hernia, unchanged
