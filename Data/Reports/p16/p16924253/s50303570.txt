                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion, edema or
 pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  A smooth convex bulge seen along the peripheral right mid lung likely
 reflects chronic healed rib fractures.  Additionally, pleural scarring at the
 right costophrenic angle may be the sequelae of prior injury.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
