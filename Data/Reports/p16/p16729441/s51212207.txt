                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, post-operative, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the PICC line has been
 removed.  Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of
 the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels, consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous
 pressure.
