 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p C4-C7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion desaturated
 in PACU requiring re-intubation.  // interval changes?

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to standard placement at the thoracic
 inlet. Lung volumes remain very low, accounting in part for mediastinal
 widening at the level of the aortic arch, but there is also progressive
 mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting volume overload. Caliber of the
 mediastinum would need to be monitored following neck surgery.
 
 No appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
