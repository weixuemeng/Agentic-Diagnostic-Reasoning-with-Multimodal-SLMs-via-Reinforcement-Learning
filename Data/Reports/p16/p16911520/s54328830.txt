                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for left-sided infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions and severe left lower
 lobe atelectasis. Previously seen possible left upper lobe opacity is no
 longer seen and likely due to overlying tubing on prior study.  No
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  ET tube ends
 5.6 cm from the carina, unchanged.  Enteric tube ends off the imaged portion. 
 Right internal jugular sheath ends just above the origin of the SVC,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in bilateral pleural effusions and left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Previously seen possible left upper lobe opacity is
 no longer seen and likely due to overlying tubing on prior study.
