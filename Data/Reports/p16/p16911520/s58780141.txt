                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post trach and PEG.  Rule out pneumothorax. 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Large subdiaphragmatic lucency
 appears to outline the diaphragm and the liver, and may represent a large
 pneumoperitoneum or a markedly distended viscous such as stomach or transverse
 colon.  Endotracheal tube has been replaced with a tracheostomy tube.  Right
 internal jugular central catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  Sternotomy
 wires are intact.  Moderate to large right and moderate left pleural effusions
 are slightly enlarged since prior with similar bibasilar opacities. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large subdiaphragmatic lucency may represent pneumoperitoneum related to
 recently placed PEG or a markedly distended viscous.  Dedicated abdominal
 radiograph could differentiate between these entities.
 
 2.  Status post tracheostomy placement.  No pneumothorax. 
 
 3.  Slight interval enlargement of moderate-to-large right and moderate left
 pleural effusions.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by Dr. ___ to ___,
 NP, on ___ at ___ PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
