                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right
 thoracocentesis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval increase in right pleural effusion.  There is substantial
 amount of pneumoperitoneum that appears to be at least the same as on the
 prior study and potentially increased.  Tracheostomy is in place.  The right
 internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  No appreciable
 pneumothorax is seen.  Left pleural effusion and atelectasis are unchanged.
