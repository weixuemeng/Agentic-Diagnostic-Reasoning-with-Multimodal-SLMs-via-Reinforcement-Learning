                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:08 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man after CABG.  Evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Tiny right apical pneumothorax is smaller. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion
 and severe left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged.  New focal opacity left
 upper lobe partially obscured by overlying tubing could be an artifact.  I
 would recommend repeating the examination with external devices removes, so
 that the abnormality can be better evaluated.  If real, itould be either a
 focal infection or infarction if real.  There is no definite pneumothorax, but
 I am unsure if the patient positioned for this imaging.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette has a normal post-operative appearance.  Pulmonary edema is mild if
 any.  ET tube in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the
 upper stomach and a right internal jugular sheath ends just above the origin
 of the superior vena cava.
 
 ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 dictation.
