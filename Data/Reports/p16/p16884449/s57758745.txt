                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for rib fracture or pneumothorax.  Status post high speed
 motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are normal. 
 No rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No rib fracture is identified.  Dedicated
 rib series is more sensitive in detecting rib fractures if there is high
 clinical concern.
