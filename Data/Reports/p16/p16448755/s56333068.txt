                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of repositioning of line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:15.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Right
 internal jugular central venous catheter has been repositioned and now
 terminates in the expected location of the distal SVC.  There are low lung
 volumes.  The mediastinum appears widened as compared to the prior study
 performed earlier today at 13:03 which could relate to lower lung volumes and
 supine AP technique, although correlate clinically for acute mediastinal
 process and consider CT if of concern.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has
 increased.  No pneumothorax.
