                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of status post right IJ
 central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax.  In
 the interval since the prior study, there has been mild increase in pulmonary
 edema.  Indistinctness of the hila has increased.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 relate to pulmonary edema though again underlying infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural
 effusion.
