                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date as well as older studies
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and widening of the vascular pedicle
 accompanied by worsening congestive heart failure with increasing perihilar
 edema.  More confluent asymmetrical opacity in the left retrocardiac region is
 noted and could reflect a combination of dependent edema, atelectasis and
 effusion, but superimposed infection is also possible in the setting of
 sepsis.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusions have increased in
 size since the recent study.
