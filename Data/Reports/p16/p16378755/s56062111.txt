                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  History of ITP with pancytopenia and CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Consistent with history, there is interstitial prominence and
 vascular engorgement centrally.  This study is somewhat limited secondary to
 body habitus and low lung volumes however the reported right pleural effusion
 is clearly evident.  There is also likely a left pleural effusion.  No
 definite single dense consolidation is noted.  Please note there is senescent
 calcification of the tracheobronchial tree.  Mild aortic tortuosity is noted
 with calcified plaque seen throughout.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult
 to assess due to low lung volumes however is enlarged and remains grossly
 stable.  Profound osteopenia is noted throughout the spine.  There is a
 compression-type deformity involving a lower thoracic spine vertebral body. 
 This is age indeterminate as no prior studies are available to confirm
 chronicity.  The level is likely T10.  Overall morphology suggests chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema likely from cardiogenic etiology.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Consider repeat radiography after
 appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.  Hypertensive
 cardiomediastinal configuration.
