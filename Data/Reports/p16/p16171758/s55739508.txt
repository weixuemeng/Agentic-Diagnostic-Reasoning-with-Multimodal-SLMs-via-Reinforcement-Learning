                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tobacco use and breast cancer, now with substernal
 chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is accentuated
 by low lung volumes but is likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal
 contours and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Multiple surgical clips projecting over the right axilla are likely
 related to prior surgery for breast cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
