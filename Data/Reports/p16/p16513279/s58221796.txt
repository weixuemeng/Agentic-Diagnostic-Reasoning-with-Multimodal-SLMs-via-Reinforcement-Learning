                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?lung CA and PNA  // Assess for worsening
 opacities
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CTA from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, no gross change.  Again seen are multi
 focal small nodular opacities throughout both lungs, most pronounced in the
 right upper and right mid zones.  The degree of involvement in the right upper
 zone is equivocally slightly worse and changes at the right lung base (right
 middle lobe ) are slightly less confluent.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, with note made of
 mediastinal and hilar lymph adenopathy identified by CT.  Known ectatic
 ascending aorta seen is slight unfolding of the aorta on this examination.
 
 No pneumothorax or effusion is identified.
 
 Incidental note made of severe right and probable mild-to-moderate left
 glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent multifocal nodular opacities in both lungs, somewhat asymmetric. 
 Possible slight worsening in the right upper zone and slight improvement in
 the right middle lobe.  As previously suggested, the differential includes
 multifocal pneumonia, other inflammatory processes or metastasis.
 
 Changes in the right middle lobe raise concern for postobstructive pneumonia
 with superimposed atelectasis.
