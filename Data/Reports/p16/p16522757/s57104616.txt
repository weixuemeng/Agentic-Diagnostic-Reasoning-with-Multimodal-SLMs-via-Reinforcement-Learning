                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left CT  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ p.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 ET tube present, with tip the top of clavicles proximally 6.6 cm above the
 carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying gastric fundus.
 Portions of the tuber obscured by the patient's lumbar spine spinal fixation
 hardware. There is left-sided chest tube. No pneumothorax is detected. There
 is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly increased. This is
 non-specific in appearance and could represent atelectasis, parenchymal
 contusion, or early pneumonic infiltrate. No gross effusion. Allowing for
 overlying tubing and materials, the right lung is grossly clear, without overt
 CHF, focal consolidation, or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left chest tube present, similar in position. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. There is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly increased.
 This is non-specific in appearance and could represent atelectasis,
 parenchymal contusion, or early pneumonic infiltrate. Attention to this area
 on followup films is requested.
