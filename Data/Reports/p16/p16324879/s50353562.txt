 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier studies of this date, there is increasing
 bibasilar opacification silhouetting the hemidiaphragms.  The findings are
 consistent with the diagnosis of basilar pneumonia made previously, though
 there probably is superimposed pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.
