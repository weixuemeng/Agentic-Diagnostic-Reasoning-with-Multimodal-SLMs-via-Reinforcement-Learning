                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Please refer to subsequent CT as finding is in the right lung are
 more likely to represent the sequelae of aspiration.

  1. Endotracheal tube tip positioned 4.3 cm above the carina.  Slight
  advancement may result in more optimal positioning.
  2. Endogastric tube positioned with its tip just beyond the GE junction. 
  Advancement would result in more optimal positioning.
  3. Right hilar mass with postobstructive collapse or pneumonia in the right
  lung.  CT required for further assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p arrest // s./p arrest/intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   An endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip located approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube extends into
 the left upper abdomen though the tip is positioned only 7 8 cm beyond the GE
 junction.  Advancement may result in more optimal positioning.  A left hilar
 mass is noted with volume loss and increased ground-glass opacity within the
 right lung most notable on the left mid and upper lung.  Findings are
 concerning for malignancy with postobstructive collapse and/or pneumonia and
 CT U is recommended to further assess.  Left lung is clear.  Chronic bilateral
 rib deformities are noted.  No large effusion on this supine radiograph.  No
 definite signs of pneumothorax.  Extensive thoracic spinal fusion hardware
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip positioned 4.3 cm above the carina.  Slight
 advancement may result in more optimal positioning.
 2. Endogastric tube positioned with its tip just beyond the GE junction. 
 Advancement would result in more optimal positioning.
 3. Right hilar mass with postobstructive collapse or pneumonia in the right
 lung.  CT required for further assessment.
