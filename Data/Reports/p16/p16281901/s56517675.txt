                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Weakness.  Evaluation of the patient after non-ST
 elevation MI.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Substantial cardiomegaly is present involving both left and right ventricle. 
 The mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable except for tortuosity of the
 vessels.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated but overall clear.  Minimal amount
 of right pleural effusion is suspected.  Atelectasis in the right lung base
 versus scarring is noted.  Nodular opacities projecting over the right mid
 lung and most likely represent nipple.  Correlation with nipple markers is
 recommended.  There is no pneumothorax.
