 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer and remaining
 chest tube.  The heart remains stably enlarged status post median sternotomy
 for CABG and valve replacement.  There is blunting of both costophrenic
 angles, left greater than right, suggestive of small effusions.  There is
 likely patchy atelectasis at both bases, best appreciated on the lateral
 projection.  The tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable, if not slightly
 smaller.  No pulmonary edema.
