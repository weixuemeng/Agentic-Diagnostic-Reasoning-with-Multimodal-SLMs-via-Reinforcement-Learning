                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of Sjogren and cervical lymphadenopathy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 The patient is after bilateral humeral replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definitive abnormality seen within the limitations of this
 study technique.  If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional
 imaging might be considered.
