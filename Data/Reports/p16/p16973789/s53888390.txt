 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ edema, worsening dyspnea and orthopnea

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Lungs are
 clear except for a questionable 1 cm nodular opacity just below the level of
 the seventh posterior right rib.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are bilateral shoulder arthroplasties, which are incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of congestive heart failure.  1 cm nodular opacity in right upper
 lung, for which further evaluation with shallow oblique radiographs is
 recommended to differentiate superimposition of normal structures from a true
 lung nodule.
