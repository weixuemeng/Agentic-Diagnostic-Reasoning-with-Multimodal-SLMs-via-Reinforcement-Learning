                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New pleuritic chest pain on the right.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC, unchanged.  Interval
 improvement of pulmonary edema is demonstrated as well as improved aeration of
 the lung bases bilaterally.  Still present bilateral pleural effusion and
 bibasilar atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Note
 is made that this study neither confirm nor exclude the possibility of
 pulmonary embolism.
