                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Open abdomen with new fever and crackles on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube tip is in standard position terminating 3.3 cm cranial
 to the carina.  Cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged with mild
 central vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.  There is re-
 demonstration of layering right greater than left pleural effusions.  There is
 no focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia although pleural effusion
 obscures the lower lung fields.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant change compared to prior examination with redemonstration of
 moderate right and small left pleural effusion.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 although the effusions obscure the lower lung bases.
