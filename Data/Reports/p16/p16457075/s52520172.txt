                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New hemorrhagic stroke.  Evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates diffuse pleural
 plaque indicative of asbestos exposure, which obscures evaluation of the lung
 parenchyma.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Massive pleural plaques obscuring parenchymal evaluation. Cross
 sectional imaging is recommended for evaluation of lungs and if not recently
 performed, for evaluation of lung malignancy in this high risk patient.
 
 These findings were relayed to the TSICU resident, by Dr. ___, at 1135AM,
