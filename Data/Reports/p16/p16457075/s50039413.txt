                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with possible stroke.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate calcified bilateral
 diaphragmatic and pleural plaques, compatible with prior asbestos exposure. 
 Median sternotomy wires are present.  Right apical thickening is noted. 
 Opacification of the right lung base may be due to underlying pneumonia or
 aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lung base opacity could represent aspiration or pneumonia depending
 on the clinical scenario.
 2.  Bilateral calcified diaphragmatic and pleural plaques are compatible with
 prior asbestos exposure.
