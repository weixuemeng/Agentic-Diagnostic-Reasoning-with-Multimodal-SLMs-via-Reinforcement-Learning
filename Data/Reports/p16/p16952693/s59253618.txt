                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:42
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new NG tube, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:01.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 8:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm
 and the tip is not fully identified.  A left-sided pacer, endotracheal tube
 and right internal jugular central line are unchanged.  There are small
 layering effusions with improving overall appearance to the lungs, suggesting
 resolving mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  However, there is a persistent
 more focal airspace consolidation in the right and mid lower lungs which
 although this could represent asymmetric clearing of edema raises concern for
 aspiration and pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Followup imaging
 may be helpful.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
