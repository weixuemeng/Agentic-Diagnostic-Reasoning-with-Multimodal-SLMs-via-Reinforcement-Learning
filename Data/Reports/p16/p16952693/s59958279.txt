 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with persistent respiratory alkalosis. 
 Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 20:34.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5:01 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left-sided pacer remains in place.  An endotracheal tube has its tip at
 thoracic inlet.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal
 SVC.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  There is increasing bilateral layering effusions and increasing
 moderate pulmonary edema.  A diffuse infectious process would be less likely. 
 Followup imaging would be advised.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
