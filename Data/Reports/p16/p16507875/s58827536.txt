                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, chills, body aches. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate leftward patient rotation
 and low lung volumes with associated accentuation of cardiomediastinal
 contours and crowding of bronchovascular structures. Left costophrenic angle
 and lateral aspect of left hemidiaphragm are obscured. There is no
 pneumothorax. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Obscuration of lateral left hemidiaphragm contour and adjacent costophrenic
 angle, possibly due to the affects of leftward patient rotation. Left pleural
 effusion and or peripheral pneumonia are difficult to exclude in this region,
 and a repeat nonrotated radiograph with improved lung volumes may be helpful
 for further assessment when the patient's condition permits.
