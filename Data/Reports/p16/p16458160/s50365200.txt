 is in place with extensive right lateral chest wall and neck subcutaneous
 emphysema with a stable small right apical pneumothorax.  There continues to
 be a stable airspace abnormality in the right mid and lower lung, possibly
 representing postinflammatory changes and/or atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
