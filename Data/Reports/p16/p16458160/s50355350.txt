                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post right chest tube placement with weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker device appears unchanged with its lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  A chest tube again projects over the
 lower right hemithorax, not significantly changed.  There is a small amount of
 intrathoracic air which is not unanticipated in the setting of a chest tube. 
 A moderate hydropneumothorax shows no definite overall change allowing for
 differences in orientation.  Mass-like opacities again project over the lower
 right chest with a free flowing component to the effusion and substantial
 volume loss in the right hemithorax.  The left lung remains clear and
 hyperexpanded.  There is no pleural effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps mild increase in hydropneumothorax but with chest tube
 remaining in place and no striking change.  Similar mass-like opacities in the
 right lower lung previously shown to probably reflect partial collapse of the
 right lung.
