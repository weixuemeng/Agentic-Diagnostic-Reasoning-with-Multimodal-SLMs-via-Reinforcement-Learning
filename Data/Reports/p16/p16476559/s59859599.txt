                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF exacerbation, altered mental status. 
 Assess for PICC in correct place? CHF exacerbation?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy, CABG, and left-sided pacemaker placement with leads in unchanged
 positions.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is markedly enlarged, unchanged.
 The aorta remains unfolded.  There is mild pulmonary edema, not substantially
 changed in the interval, with small to moderate size right and probable trace
 left pleural effusions.  The pleural effusions overall are likely unchanged in
 size.  No pneumothorax is present.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild congestive heart failure with mild pulmonary edema and small to
 moderate size right pleural effusion and tiny left pleural effusion,
 unchanged.
 2. Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.
