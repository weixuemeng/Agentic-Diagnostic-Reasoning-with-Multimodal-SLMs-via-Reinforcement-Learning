 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina,
 the tube could be advanced by 1 cm.  The patient has also received a Swan-Ganz
 catheter that is in correct position.  The sternal wires are showing normal
 alignment.  Low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 sinus could suggest the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion.  No other
 relevant changes.
