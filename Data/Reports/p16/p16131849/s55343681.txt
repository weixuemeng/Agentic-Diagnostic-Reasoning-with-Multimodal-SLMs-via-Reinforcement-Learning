                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with spontaneous pnx  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray dated ___ and ___ at 16:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided chest tube is in place. When compared to the films from ___
 and ___, there appears to have been progressive retraction of the tip of
 the left chest tube, moving closer to the left chest wall.
 
 There is background COPD with hyperinflation, parenchymal scarring, and
 prominent areas of hyperlucency in both lung apices/upper zones, in the right
 lung laterally, and at the right lung base. There is probable bullous change
 at both apices. In the setting, it would be difficult to exclude a
 pneumothorax.
 
 Nonetheless, there is curvilinear lucency around the periphery of the left
 upper zone medially and laterally, likely continuing into the left along apex,
 consistent with a small to moderate size pneumothorax. This is similar, but
 probably slightly larger, compared to ___. Again seen is subcutaneous
 emphysema along the left upper and mid chest.
 
 No left-sided basilar pneumothorax is detected. Of note, however, though there
 is opacity at the left lung base consistent with a small to moderate effusion
 and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, new compared with ___,
 though similar to ___.   In addition, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 but unchanged.
 
 Incidental note is made of clips in the right upper quadrant and soft tissue
 anchors over the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left chest tube has progressively retracted toward the left chest wall,
 compared with ___ and ___. The side port remains at over the lung
 itself.
 2. Small to moderate left pneumothorax seen in the upper left lung, best
 appreciated medially and laterally, similar, but possibly slightly larger than
 on ___.
 3. Small left effusion, with underlying collapse under consolidation that has
 progressed compared with ___. Elevated left hemidiaphragm again noted.
 4. Hyperlucency in the right upper, right mid lateral, and right lower zones.
 This may very well represent relate to background COPD. Background parenchymal
 distortion scarring related to COPD is also suggested.
