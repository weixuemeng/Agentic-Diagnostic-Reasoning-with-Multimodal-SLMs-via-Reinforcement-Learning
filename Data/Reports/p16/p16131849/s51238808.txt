                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left spontaneous pneumothorax.  Chest tube placed,
 outside hospital transferred, suction to waterseal.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 8:38 a.m.
 
 On today's radiograph, the left chest tube tip continues to retract to lie
 closer to the chest wall than on the prior film. 
 
 Again seen is lucency around the left lung superiorly, that is consistent with
 a pneumothorax.  Two air-fluid levels are noted, consistent with
 hydropneumothorax, best seen on the lateral view and, in retrospect, similar
 to the prior film.  There is left base collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 right lung is grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight retraction of the left chest tube compared with the most recent
 prior film.
 
 2.  Left pneumothorax extending around a good part of the left upper and mid
 lung, overall similar to the prior film.  Evidence for hydropneumothorax
 anteriorly and posteriorly.
