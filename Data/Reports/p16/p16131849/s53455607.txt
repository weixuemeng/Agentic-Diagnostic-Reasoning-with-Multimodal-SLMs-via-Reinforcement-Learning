                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pneumothorax on CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As better
 assessed on preceding outside hospital CT performed earlier today, there is a
 small-to-moderate right pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is minimally shifted to
 the left, and there may be a small amount of tension.  Large area of
 consolidation in the left lung and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are
 similar to prior.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are also similar.
