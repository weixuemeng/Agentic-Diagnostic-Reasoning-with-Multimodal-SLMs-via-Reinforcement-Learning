                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left spontaneous pneumothorax status post chest tube at outside
 hospital, status post chest tube removal, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 A small left apical pneumothorax remains visible. The ptx at the upper and
 upper medial left chest is very slightly larger than on the prior exam.  The
 ptx along the mediastinal surface of the left chest is grossly unchanged. 
 Hemothoraces are grossly unchanged, seen on the lateral view. Lucency at the
 right apex, of indeterminate significance, is unchanged.  Parenchymal findings
 are unchanged, 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left apical pneumothorax is slightly larger, detailed above.
 2.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
