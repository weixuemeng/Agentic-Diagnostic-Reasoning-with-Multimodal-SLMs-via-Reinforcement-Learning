                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Spontaneous pneumothorax, chest tube now clamped, question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST (PA & LAT)
 
 A left chest tube is noted, similar in positioning to the prior film.  Some
 residual lucency is seen about the left lung apex and along the left side of
 the mediastinum and the possibility of a small residual pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded.  No interval enlargement of the pneumothorax is suggested. 
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  There is also lucency -- but
 no definite ptx -- at the right lung apex, which is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suspect small residual left apical pneumothorax.  No interval enlargement
 compared with ___ at 14:43 p.m.
 
 2.  Unchanged lucency of right lung apex.  No definite right apical
 pneumothorax.
