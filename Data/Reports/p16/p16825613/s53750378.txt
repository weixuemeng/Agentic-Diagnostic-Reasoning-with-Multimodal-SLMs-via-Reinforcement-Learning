  Right suprahilar opacity which may represent overlap of vascular structures
  however, underlying small consolidation or pulmonary lesion not excluded.
  Additionally, there is a subtle opacity projecting over the lateral right lung
  base which may relate to the anterior right seventh rib, but, especially given
  underlying COPD, an underlying lesion at this location is not excluded. Subtle
  overall increase of the right lung base.  Recommend chest CT for further
  evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with worsening DOE, chronic cough  // eval for PNA,
 mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 LUNGS ARE HYPERINFLATED. The aorta is unfolded. THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE IS NOT
 ENLARGED. THERE IS A RIGHT SUPRAHILAR OPACITY WHICH MAY REPRESENT OVERLAP OF
 VASCULAR STRUCTURES HOWEVER, UNDERLYING SMALL CONSOLIDATION OR PULMONARY
 LESION NOT EXCLUDED. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SUBTLE OPACITY PROJECTING OVER
 THE LATERAL RIGHT LUNG BASE WHICH MAY RELATE TO THE ANTERIOR RIGHT SEVENTH
 RIB, BUT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN UNDERLYING COPD AN UNDERLYING LESION AT THIS
 LOCATION IS NOT EXCLUDED. THERE IS ALSO A SUBTLE OVERALL INCREASE IN OPACITY
 OF THE RIGHT LUNG BASE.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right suprahilar opacity which may represent overlap of vascular structures

 Additionally, there is a subtle opacity projecting over the lateral right lung
 base which may relate to the anterior right seventh rib, but, especially given
