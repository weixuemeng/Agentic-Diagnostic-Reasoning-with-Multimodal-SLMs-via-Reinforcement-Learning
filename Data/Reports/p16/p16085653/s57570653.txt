                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of leukocytosis and
 fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Linear bibasilar
 opacities most likely relate to atelectasis rather than consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema.
