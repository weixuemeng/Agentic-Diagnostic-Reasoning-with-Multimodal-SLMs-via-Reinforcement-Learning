                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable radiograph of the chest compared with prior radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular line ends at low SVC and endotracheal tube terminating
 approximately 3 cm above the carina are appropriate.  There is a new opacity
 at the right lung base, whereas at the left lung base, opacity has increased
 since ___ and this may reflect either aspiration or atelectasis.
 Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Presumed right pleural
 effusion is mild.  Bilateral hila and pulmonary vasculature prominence
 signifies vascular congestion.  Mildly enlarged heart size and mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasal lung opacities likely reflect aspiration or
 atelectasis.  Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged and presumed
 right pleural effusion is mild.
