 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort.
 
 Otherwise, there are no relevant changes.  Cardiomegaly, bilateral moderate
 pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis.  Unchanged evidence of
 mild-to-moderate fluid overload.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal
 opacities.
