                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 12:02 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The new endotracheal tube terminates 2.8
 cm above the level of the carina.  Interval placement of a nasogastric
 catheter is identified with the tip in the stomach.  The side port of the NG
 tube is above the left hemidiaphragm and advancement is recommended. 
 Bibasilar opacities persist, left greater than right, probable atelectasis. 
 There may be slightly increased pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt
 edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, in standard position.
 2.  New nasogastric tube should be advanced furthere into the stomach.
 3.  Stable basilar opacities, left greater than right, likely atelectasis.
