                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, exacerbation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right lung
 opacity has slightly increased in extent.  In addition, there is blunting of
 the right costophrenic sinus, potentially suggestive of a new small pleural
 effusion.  The findings would be consistent with a combination of pulmonary
 edema and pneumonia.
 
 The lung volumes remain low.  Unchanged massive cardiomegaly and
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 No left pleural effusion.
 
 Change in the right humeral head could indicate chronic right shoulder
 subluxation.
