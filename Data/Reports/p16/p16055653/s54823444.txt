                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, dyspnea and leukocytosis with leftward shift. 
 Question pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and ___,
 earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but is
 probably unchanged.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is an extensive
 consolidation in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe.  The
 appearance is fairly similar to the more recent prior radiographs allowing for
 differences in technique although pulmonary vasculature is somewhat less
 prominent.  It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions but no definite
 pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged, including cardiac enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent consolidation in the right lower lung worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show resolution within eight weeks.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion but seemingly improved.
