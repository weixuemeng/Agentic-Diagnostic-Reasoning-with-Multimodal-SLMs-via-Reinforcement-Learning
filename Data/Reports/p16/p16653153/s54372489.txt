                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and acute chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest was provided.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip terminating 1.4 cm above the carina. 
 NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.  A right IJ central venous
 catheter is in place.  There is no large consolidation within the lungs,
 though possibility of mild pulmonary edema is difficult to exclude given the
 vague ground-glass opacity seen throughout.  No large effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen on this supine portable exam.  The heart is moderately enlarged. 
 Pacer is seen overlying the left axilla with pacer lead extending into the
 region of the right ventricle.  Right IJ central venous catheter is in place. 
 No bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, possible mild pulmonary edema.  ET tip located 1.4
 cm above the carina.  Recommend retraction by 1 cm.  Otherwise unremarkable.
