                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o asthma and previous hilar adenoathy with
 hypoxemia. No fever, cough, wheezing or sob  // r/o CHF     r/o CHF
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little interval change.
 Again there is an unusual size and shape of the left hilum and extensive
 pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall.  The stellate scarring
 in the axillary region of the left lung is unchanged.
 There is the suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base with
 poor definition of the heart border.  This could possibly represent an area of
 consolidation in the middle lobe.
 The overall appearance is somewhat similar to the CT scout from ___.  This examination demonstrated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as
 well as chronic pulmonary thickening, most consistent with sarcoidosis.
