                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable erect chest radiograph was obtained.  The lung
 volumes are low.  There is an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity, which does not
 silhouette the left hemidiaphragm.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  The
 aortic arch is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents
 atelectasis rather than focal consolidation.
