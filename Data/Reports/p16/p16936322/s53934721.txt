                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 COPD and history of pneumothorax.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains top normal.  The aorta is moderately tortuous but
 unchanged.  The pulmonary arteries remain enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  There is minimal atelectasis in the lung bases. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view may be due
 to chronic pleural thickening.  The lungs are hyperinflated compatible with
 COPD.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is otherwise demonstrated. 
 There are mild multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with
 slight loss of height of several mid and lower vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  COPD.  No pneumothorax.
