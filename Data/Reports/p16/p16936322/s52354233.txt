 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:42 PM
  1. Multiple rounded opacities within the left hemithorax rib fractures with
  pleural thickening or new lung lesions.
  2. Round opacity at right hilum likely represents main pulmonary artery on
  end.
  3. Recommend new frontal film for further clarification.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 6:56 AM
  1. Multiple rounded opacities throughout the lungs. Comparison with previous
  films is recommended. Findings are worrisome for metastatic disease of unclear
  etiology, septic emboli, and multi focal pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
  recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with resp distress. Assess for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated. Multiple rounded opacities are seen
 throughout the left hemi thorax projecting at the end of ribs and may
 represent old rib fractures with pleural thickening. Rounded opacity at the
 right hilum likely represents main pulmonary artery on end. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Mildly prominent heart is related to patient
 positioning and lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Multiple rounded opacities projecting over the left mid chest could be rib
 fractures with pleural thickening.
 2. Round opacity at right hilum likely represents main pulmonary artery on
 end.
 3.  Recommend new frontal film for further clarification.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ the
 telephone on ___ at 7:55 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of updated
 findings.
