                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax with chest tube in place. Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 nasogastric and endotracheal tubes.  A left chest tube is unchanged in
 position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly
 increased.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely secondary to
 rotation.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumothorax.  Mild increase in bibasilar atelectasis.
