                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portale view of the chest.  There is suggestion of a
 left-sided pneumothorax seen with what appears to be a pleural line
 inferolaterally and superolaterally as well.  There is lack of clear lung
 markings seen distal to this area.  If amenable, repeat with patient in the
 radiology department is suggested to confirm.  There is increased opacity at
 the left lung base potentially due to atelectasis, although infection cannot
 be entirely excluded.  The right lung is grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Tortuous thoracic aorta is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suspicious for left-sided pneumothorax.  Findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:40 p.m. over the phone, one minute after
 time of discovery.
