                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumothorax, now intubated post chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Two sets of radiographs from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. 
 Previously noted pigtail catheter in the left lateral chest wall has been
 removed with interval placement of a chest tube directed towards the left apex
 with reexpansion of the left lung.  Increased opacification at the left base
 likely reflect atelectasis.  Streaky atelectatic changes involving the right
 base are unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no
 large effusion.
 
 The patient is now status post endotracheal tube placement, terminating
 approximately 4 cm above the carina in adequate position.  NG tube is
 subdiaphragmatic but the exact location of the tip is not visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post interval placement of endotracheal and nasogastric tube
 placement in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Interval placement of a left-sided chest tube directed towards the left
 apex with reexpansion of the left lung.
