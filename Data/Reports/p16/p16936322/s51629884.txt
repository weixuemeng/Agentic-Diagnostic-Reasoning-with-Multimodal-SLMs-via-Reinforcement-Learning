                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumothorax, post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal upright view of the chest redemonstrates
 a moderate left pneumothorax, relatively unchanged in size compared to the
 prior study. A pigtail catheter through a left lateral approach terminates in
 the axilla.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is
 again noted. Increased opacification at the left and right base are unchanged
 and likely reflect atelectasis. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate left pneumothorax, unchanged in size and distribution compared to
 the prior study.
 
 2.  Left pigtail catheter terminates in the axilla and does not enter the
 pleural cavity and needs to be repositioned.
