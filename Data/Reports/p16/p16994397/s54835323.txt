                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with epigastric pain and pancreatitis, rule
 out pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are well expanded and show mild
 interstitial opacities, unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged with the left atrium enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouettes are
 normal.  The right hilar contour is prominent, unchanged, likely related to a
 enlarged pulmonary artery.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild pulmonary edema with unchanged mild cardiomegaly. 
 No pleural effusion.  Enlarged left atrium suggests that there might be a
 component of mitral valve disease.
