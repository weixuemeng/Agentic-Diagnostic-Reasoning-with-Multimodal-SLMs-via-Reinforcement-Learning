                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock and cardiac amyloid  //
 Any interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is now present,
 tip over proximal most right pulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax is detected
 
 Inspiratory volumes are somewhat low, but similar to the prior film.  Allowing
 for this, there is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar to the
 prior film.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, slightly increased.  No overt CHF
 or gross effusion.  No definite focal infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip over proximal most pulmonary artery.
 Slightly more pronounced bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
