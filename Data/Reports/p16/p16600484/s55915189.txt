                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pleuritic chest pain and decreased right
 breath sounds.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is a
 moderate right pneumothorax. Leftward indentation of the right heart border
 suggests minimal tension in the appropriate clinical setting. No left
 pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Heart size is
 normal without evidence of pericardial effusion. There is suggestion of
 ascending aortic dilation on the lateral view. Hilar contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax may be under minimal tension. Correlate
 clinically.
 2.  Possible ascending aortic dilation should be evaluated by CTA when acute
 issues have resolved.

 ___ by phone at 2:05 p.m. ___.  Updated findings #1 and #2 after
