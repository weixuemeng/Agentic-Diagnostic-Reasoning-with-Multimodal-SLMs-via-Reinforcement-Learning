                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with positive PPD, three months of
 cough, evaluate for consolidation or other lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  The enlargement involves
 mostly the left ventricle which is prominent to the left and posteriorly.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated most prominently in the mid
 portion of the descending aorta which bulges towards the left.  There exists a
 few calcifications in the wall of the aorta at the level of the arch but no
 other local contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic pulmonary abnormalities are
 seen, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax
 is present in the apical area.  Rather advanced degenerative changes are seen
 in the mid portion of the thoracic spine with multiple disc degenerations and
 prominent osteophytic reactions which at times are bridging.  There is no
 evidence of vertebral body compression fracture or marked scoliosis.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement mostly involving the left ventricle.
 This exists together with a generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta. 
 The rather isolated left ventricular enlargement is suggestive of volume
 overload possibly related to aortic valve incompetence, as there is no
 evidence of pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates.  Referral to
 cardiologist to evaluate described radiographic cardiac abnormalities is
 recommended.
