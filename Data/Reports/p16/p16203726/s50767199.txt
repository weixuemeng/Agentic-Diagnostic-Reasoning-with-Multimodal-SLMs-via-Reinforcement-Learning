                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheal bronchoplasty.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the
 field of view.  Hardware in the cervical spine is partially imaged, and
 unchanged.
 
 Since the prior exam, there is increased aeration in the right lung, likely
 due to improved pulmonary edema.  There are persistent linear opacities in the
 right mid lung zone and at the bilateral bases, most consistent with
 atelectasis.  There are likely tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The heart size is moderately enlarged,
 and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.  Persistent atelectasis.
 Unchanged cardiomegaly.
