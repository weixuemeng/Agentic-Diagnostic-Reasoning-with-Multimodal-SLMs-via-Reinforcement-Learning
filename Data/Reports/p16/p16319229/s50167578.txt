                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and fever, crackles at both lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Chest is overinflated due to emphysema or small airway obstruction.
 
 Triangular region of opacity at the right lung base projects over the spine on
 the lateral view, could be atelectasis or pneumonia.  Oblique views might be
 helpful in making that distinction.  Upper lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusion.  Heart size normal.
 
 In the absence of subsequent imaging, I would presume right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:15 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
