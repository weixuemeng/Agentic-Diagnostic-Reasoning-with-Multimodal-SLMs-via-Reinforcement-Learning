                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is slight increased opacity projecting over the
 spine on the lateral view, potentially localizing to the left on the frontal
 view.  The frontal view is not significantly changed from prior.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are notable for stable linear opacity in the left mid lung with
 possible overlying pleural thickening.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but
 not significantly changed.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant suggesting prior cholecystectomy.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view,
 likely due to atelectasis. Please refer to subsequent CT chest.
