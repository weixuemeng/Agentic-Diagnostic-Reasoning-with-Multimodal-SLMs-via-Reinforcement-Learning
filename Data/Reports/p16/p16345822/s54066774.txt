                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___, ___ and ___.  CT chest
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are mildly underinflated but appear clear.  There is no
 focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are stable.  Heart size is somewhat exaggerated by low lung
 volumes and likely normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly low lung volumes but no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
