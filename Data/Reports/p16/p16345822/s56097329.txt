                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  History of lupus and Sjogren's with prior pleural
 pericarditis.  Worsening chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 streaky left mid lung opacities, which have shifted configuration slightly;
 these suggest minor chronic atelectasis or scarring.  There is mild upper zone
 redistribution of the pulmonary vascularity which suggests pulmonary venous
 hypertension or perhaps slight congestion, but otherwise the lungs appear
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight vascular congestion; otherwise,
 unremarkable.
