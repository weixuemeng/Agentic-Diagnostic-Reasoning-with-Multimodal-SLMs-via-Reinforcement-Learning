                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Evaluation of cystic structures on prior radiographs requested.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 few ring shadows are again noted in the upper lungs, two on each side. 
 Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in small pulmonary cystic structures. 
 These could be seen with acute processes such as septic emboli, but could be
 seen with more chronic processes such as bronchiectasis, pneumatoceles, or
 potentially cavitating nodules associated with inflammatory processes such as
 Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  Correlation with clinical findings is
 recommended.
