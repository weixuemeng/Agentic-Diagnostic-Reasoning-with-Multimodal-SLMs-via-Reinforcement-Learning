                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung
 volumes without pleural effusion, focal consolidations or pneumothorax. 
 Subtle cystic structures in the mid lung noted (bilat) could reflect summation
 of bronchovascular markings. Hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size
 is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Subtle cystic structures in the mid lung noted (bilat) could reflect
 summation of bronchovascular markings. Consider oblique views to resolve this
 finding.
