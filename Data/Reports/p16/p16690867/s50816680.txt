                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  A left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker device is again noted with leads in unchanged position. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, unchanged.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly suggests trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Compression deformity of a low thoracic
 vertebral body is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace bilateral pleural
 effusions, not substantially changed in the interval.
