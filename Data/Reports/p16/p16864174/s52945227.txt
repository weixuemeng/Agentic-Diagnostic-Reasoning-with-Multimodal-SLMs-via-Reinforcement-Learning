                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest. Low lung volumes limits
 evaluation with bronchovascular crowding partially obscuring evaluation of the
 lung bases. Retrocardiac opacity more apparent on the lateral could reflect
 atelectasis or developing left lower lobe pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting. Cardiomediastinal sillouhette is stable and normal though aortic
 calcification is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, atelectasis vs.pneumonia.
