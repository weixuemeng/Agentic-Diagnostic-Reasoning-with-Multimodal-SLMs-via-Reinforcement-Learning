                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pneumonia, central line placed  // post Central
 line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip terminating in the right atrium. The endotracheal tube is
 unchanged in position heart remains too high terminating at the thoracic
 inlet. The NG tube is subdiaphragmatic, tip not imaged. Right mid/lower lung
 consolidation is unchanged over this short interval followup.  Left lung is
 clear.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right IJ line with tip in the proximal right
 atrium. Consider withdrawing the line by 2 cm for more optimal placement.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position but remains too high,
 terminating at the thoracic inlet.
 
 3.  Otherwise, no substantial change over this short interval followup
 including right mid/lower lung consolidation.
