                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sepsis  // evidence of pneumonia, confirm ET
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable AP semi erect views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip is at the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm above
 the carina.  Given that the patient's chin is not down, the tube should be
 advanced by no more than 3 cm for optimal placement.  The NG tube can be
 followed to the region of the pylorus however the tip is not imaged. Possible
 drainage catheter projects over the left upper quadrant. There is dense
 airspace consolidation in the right mid/lower lung.  The left lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits and apparent shift of the
 heart and mediastinum to the right is likely due to rotation. There is no
 large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip is at the thoracic inlet and should be advanced by
 no more than 3 cm for optimal placement.
 
 2.  Right mid/lower lung consolidation is consistent with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical context.
