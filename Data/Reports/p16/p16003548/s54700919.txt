 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. NG tube tip is in
 the stomach. Drain is projecting over the mid abdomen. Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged in appearance as well as the right mid and lower
 lung consolidations that might be consistent with aspiration but overall
 unchanged since the prior study. No appreciable pneumothorax demonstrated.
 
 There is a linear lucency projecting over the right upper chest, most likely
 representing skin fold since there is continued shin of the lung markings
 beyond this point. Repeated radiograph to confirm that is recommended
