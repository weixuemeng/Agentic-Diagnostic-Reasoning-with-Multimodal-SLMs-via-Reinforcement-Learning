                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p dual chamber PPM.  // Assess leads placement
 and r/o PTx.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs are fully expanded.  An 8 mm
 densely calcified granuloma in the posterior right lower lobe is unchanged. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size
 is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 unremarkable. Incidental note made of a moderate hiatal hernia and multiple
 consecutive posterolateral right rib fractures, likely chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac pacemaker leads are within the expected location without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Incidental note made of a moderate hiatal hernia.
