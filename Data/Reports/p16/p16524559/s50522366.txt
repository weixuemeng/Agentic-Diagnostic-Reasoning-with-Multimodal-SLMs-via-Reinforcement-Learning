                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation or superimposed edema is noted.  There is a
 markedly tortuous aorta similar to the prior exam.  The cardiac silhouette
 size is top normal.  There is likely a tiny right pleural effusion.  This
 likely was present on the prior exam.  Grossly this could represent mild
 scarring.  No pneumothorax is evident.  A stable anterior wedging deformity
 from prior superior endplate compression fracture is seen in the lower
 thoracic spine.  Otherwise, the osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively stable exam with no acute process identified.  There
 is hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration.  There is a stable
 compression fracture involving the lower thoracic vertebral body.  Question
 possible small underlying right pleural effusion versus scarring.
