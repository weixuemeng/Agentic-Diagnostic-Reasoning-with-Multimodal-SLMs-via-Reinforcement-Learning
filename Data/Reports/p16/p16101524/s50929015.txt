                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and
 leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Noncontrast abdominal CT from an outside facility performed on
 the same day.  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are vague opacities in the bilateral lower lobes, which correspond to
 the ground-glass opacities and intralobular septal thickening seen in the
 imaged portion of the lower lung on the prior CT.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear. Aside from mild cardiomegaly, the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal. There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. There is
 no significant pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague bilateral lower lobe opacities, corresponding to ground-glass opacity
 and interlobular septal thickening seen on the CT, may represent pulmonary
 edema, however is the lack of vascular engorgement or pleural effusion is
 somewhat unusual.  Atypical pneumonia should also be considered.
