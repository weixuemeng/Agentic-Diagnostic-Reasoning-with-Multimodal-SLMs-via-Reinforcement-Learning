                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Pulmonary opacification has
 progressed in the right lower lobe, but improved in the left lung compared to
 three hours prior.  The heart size is stable.  Small pleural effusion is now
 present on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening right lower opacity in the setting of improving
 interstitial edema raises concern for concurrent pneumonia.
