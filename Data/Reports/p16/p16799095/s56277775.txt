 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 712  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with a new diagnosis of acute delayed
 cardiomyopathy, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 807.
 
 AP chest film ___ at 7:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged with a globular configuration which is
 consistent with the patient's known cardiomyopathy, although pericardial
 effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  There is decrease in the bilateral
 pleural effusions with a small residual effusion seen only on the right side
 at this time.  The pulmonary edema has resolved.  There continues to be some
 cephalization of the vasculature suggestive of pulmonary venous hypertension. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
