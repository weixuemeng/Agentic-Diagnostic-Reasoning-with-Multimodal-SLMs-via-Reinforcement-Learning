  ETT terminates less than 1 cm from the carina with the neck extended.  Enteric
  tube noted, with distal tip not captured on the current study.  No
  pneumothorax.  Left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, but
  underlying consolidation not excluded.  Hazy opacification at the right lung
  base likely represents a combination of small effusion and atelectasis.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone
  on ___ at 8:15 PM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT placement  // ETT position      ETT
 position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube is too
 close to the carina and should be pulled back approximately 3 cm.  Nasogastric
 tube extends to the lower body of the stomach, where coils upward and has its
 tip in the mid body of the stomach.  Opacification at the left base
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  Minimal atelectasis and effusion at
 the right base.
