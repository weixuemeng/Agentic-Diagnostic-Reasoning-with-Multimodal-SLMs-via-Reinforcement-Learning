                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 extends below the hemidiaphragm and out of view.  Stable, severe right convex
 scoliosis.  Stable, severe cardiomegaly.  Stable opacity at the right base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Apparent interval increase in hazy opacification
 of the right hemithorax likely reflects layering of the moderate, right
 pleural effusion.  Stable, moderate left pleural effusion.  Persistent
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects left basilar atelectasis.  New, mild
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable, severe cardiomegaly with new, mild pulmonary edema, consistent with
 heart failure.
