                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is relatively
 unchanged compared to the prior exam.  There is calcification and tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta which is stable.  Perihilar haziness with vascular
 indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved
 compared to the prior exam.  More focal opacities within the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions
 appear to have improved.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Remote left-sided rib
 fracture is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved from the prior exam.  Interval
 decrease in size of previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
