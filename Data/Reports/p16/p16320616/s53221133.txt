                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Evaluation of the right lung apex is obscured due to
 the patient's chin projecting over this region.  The heart size remains
 moderate to severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and aneurysmally
 dilated, better seen on the prior CT.  In the interval, there is worsening
 pulmonary edema which is now moderate to severe in extent, with increased size
 of bilateral pleural effusions which are small to moderate on the right and
 trace on the left.  Ill-defined airspace opacities within the lung bases could
 reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  No
 large pneumothorax is detected, but again the right lung apex is obscured. 
 Mild compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is again noted
 as well as within an upper lumbar vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening congestive heart failure with moderate to severe pulmonary edema,
 increased size of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and
 bibasilar airspace opacities which could reflect atelectasis though aspiration
 or infection cannot be excluded.
