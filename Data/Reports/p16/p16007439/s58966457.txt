                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight loss, lower extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is felt to most likely
 represent overlap of vascular structures, as seen on prior chest radiograph. 
 No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, not significantly changed.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle right cardiophrenic opacity most likely represents overlap of vascular
 structures with possible underlying atelectasis.
