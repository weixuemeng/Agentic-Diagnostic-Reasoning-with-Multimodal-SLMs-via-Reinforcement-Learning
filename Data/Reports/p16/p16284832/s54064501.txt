                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker insertion, to assess for pneumothorax and lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the pacer leads remains in good
 position and there is no evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.  Some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease,
 though there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
