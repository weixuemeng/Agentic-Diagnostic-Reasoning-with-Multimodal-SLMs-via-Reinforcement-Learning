                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, evaluate for infection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest films on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  There are small
 left-greater-than-right effusions.  There is patchy opacity at the left base,
 which could represent a pneumonic infiltrate.  No CHF.  Remainder of the lungs
 are grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Patchy opacity left base, consistent with an effusion and underlying
 atelectasis.  The possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.   
 2) Possible minimal atelectasis in the lingula.
 3) Small right effusion.
