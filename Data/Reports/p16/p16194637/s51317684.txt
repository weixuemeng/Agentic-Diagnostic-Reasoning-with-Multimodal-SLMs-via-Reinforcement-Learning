 tracheostomy.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Cervical spine hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of tracheostomy without radiographic evidence for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
