                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent aggressive volume resuscitation.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is persistent interstitial prominence consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  This is not significantly changed from prior radiograph. 
 There is a new opacity at the right base which is asymmetric in comparison to
 the left.  It is most likely due to aspiration or infection.  Less likely, it
 could represent asymmetric edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and
 normal.  A TIPS catheter is noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right lower lobe opacity, concerning for infection or aspiration. 
 Less likely, this could represent asymmetric edema.
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
