 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Delirium and hypotension, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is severely
 rotated to the right.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Unchanged pacemaker leads and position of the pacemaker.  The presence of a
 minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  However, no evidence of
 pneumonia is present on the current radiograph.  No pneumothorax.
