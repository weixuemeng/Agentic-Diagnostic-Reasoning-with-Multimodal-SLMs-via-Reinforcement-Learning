                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Whereas the left hemithorax was previously completely opacified,
 there is now marked improved aeration of the left upper lobe, with residual
 atelectasis involving the left lower lobe.  Small-to-moderate pleural effusion
 on the left is difficult to compare to the previous study for change due to
 the presence of complete lung collapse on the prior exam.  Partial atelectasis
 of the right lower lobe is present, manifested by a right retrocardiac opacity
 and inferior displacement of the right hilum.  Small right pleural effusion is
 not appreciably changed.
