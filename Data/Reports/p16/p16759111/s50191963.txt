                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a
 chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 quite low, which limits the evaluation.  Residual contrast is noted in the
 colon.  Dense band-like opacity is noted in the left lower lung which may
 reflect chronic atelectasis given the stable appearance over time.  Otherwise,
 the lungs appear clear, though low lung volumes somewhat limit the evaluation.
 Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable band-like opacity in the left lower lung is most compatible
 with chronic atelectasis.  Limited study without definite signs for acute
 interval changes.
