 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is chronic, and no large pleural effusion is
 demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Right PICC tip terminates
 in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from prior with continued chronic
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm and associated left basilar opacity likely
 reflective of atelectasis. Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. This
