                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from a CT of the chest performed ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is a patchy new opacity in
 the anterolateral portion of the right lower lobe with a suspected very small
 effusion.  Vague opacity also projects over the lateral right mid lung on the
 PA view.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new right basilar opacity and vague right mid lung
 opacities, which could be seen with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No evidence for congestive heart failure.
