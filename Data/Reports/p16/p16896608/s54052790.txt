                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Motor vehicle collision
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board limits assessment.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is mildly to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema.  No gross focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  No
 displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No grossly acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
