                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, though assessment is
 limited given the low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes, but infection is not completely excluded.  Consider
 repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory effort for further assessment.
