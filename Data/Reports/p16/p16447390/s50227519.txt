                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided chest pain and cough,
 assess for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta of ordinary
 ___ without evidence of local contour abnormality.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  On both lung bases there exists some linear
 densities slightly more on the right than on the left side.  These appear to
 be peripheral atelectasis occurring in a patient with shallow inspiratory
 activity.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any major fluid accumulation.  No
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.  Comparison is made with the next available previous chest
 examination dated ___; findings are grossly identical.  Thus, no
 evidence of new acute pulmonary processes.
