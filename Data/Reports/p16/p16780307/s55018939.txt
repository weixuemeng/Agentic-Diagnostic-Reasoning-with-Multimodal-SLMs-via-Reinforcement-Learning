                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New cough in the setting of malignancy.  Bilateral rhonchi.  Review
 of OMR yields a history of lymphoma.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 A right-sided indwelling catheter is present, with tip over mid/distal SVC.  
 No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild vascular plethora, with possible mild interstitial
 edema.  There is patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region with tenting of the
 medial diaphragm and obscuration of the left costophrenic angle.  There is
 mild patchy opacity in the cardiophrenic region as well.  The extreme right
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross right effusion is
 detected. A tiny right-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is a
 well-corticated tapered appearance to the distal clavicle, which may reflect
 remote surgery.   
 
 Compared to ___, the CHF findings are slightly more pronounced.  The
 bibasilar opacities are quite similar.  No new opacity is detected.
