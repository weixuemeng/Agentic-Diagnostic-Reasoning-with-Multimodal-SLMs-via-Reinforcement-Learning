                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, questionable fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  In almost unchanged manner, a zone of increased radiodensity is
 visible at the medial and basal portions of the right lung.  There is evidence
 of small air bronchogram and parenchymal volume loss.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, the changes could be infectious in origin.  Also unchanged
 is the better visibility of changes on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph.
 
 A potentially pre-existing minimal right pleural effusion has completely
 resolved.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Right pectoral
 Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
