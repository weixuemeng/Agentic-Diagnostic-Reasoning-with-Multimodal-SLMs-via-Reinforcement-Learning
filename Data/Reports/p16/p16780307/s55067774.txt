                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Transfer from outside hospital with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ Port-A-Cath with tip in the mid SVC.  The heart
 is upper limits normal in size.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion.  There are patchy
 areas of alveolar infiltrate, most marked in the right lower lung.  It is
 unclear how much of this is from fluid overload or if a superimposed
 infectious infiltrate is present.
