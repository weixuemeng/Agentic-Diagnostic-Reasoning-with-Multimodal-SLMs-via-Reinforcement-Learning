                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath again terminates in the superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is mild volume
 loss at the left lung base with mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
 patchy retrocardiac opacity, although this appears unchanged and suggests
 chronic atelectasis rather than an acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent volume loss at the left lung base and patchy opacity,
 probably consistent with unchanged chronic atelectasis, with no definite acute
 superimposed process.
