                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large retrocardiac lucency is seen which may be due to a large
 hiatal hernia with adjacent right base atelectasis.  Left basilar opacity is
 seen which is worrisome for pneumonia.  The right base opacities may be due to
 atelectasis, although additional site of infection is not excluded.  There is
 also likely pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen and
 there may be pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Right
 base opacity may be due to atelectasis adjacent to a large hiatal hernia
 though additional focus of infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Mild
 pulmonary edema.  Difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.
