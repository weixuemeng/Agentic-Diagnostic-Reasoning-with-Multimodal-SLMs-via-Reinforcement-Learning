                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with motor vehicle accident presenting with
 neck pain and sternal pain with deep breath.  Evaluate for injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no other fracture is
 identified, this study is suboptimal for the detection of rib fractures.  If
 there is further clinical concern dedicated rib views should be obtained.
