                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___, 21:33
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right-sided effusion and significant
 pain after chest tube placement.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 20:04.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 21:33 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place and there is near-complete
 resolution of layering right effusion with interval improvement in aeration at
 the right base where there is now only streaky linear opacities likely
 reflecting residual atelectasis.  Left lung remains clear.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  A small triangular opacity is noted in the right mid lung which may be
 vascular confluence; this can be further assessed on followup imaging. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
