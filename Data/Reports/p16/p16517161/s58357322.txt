                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with malignant pleural effusion,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Left-sided subclavian approach Port-A-Cath system unchanged. 
 Heart size remains normal and thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures
 unaltered.  No pulmonary vascular congestion.  The right-sided pleural density
 occupying and obliterating the right lateral and posterior pleural sinus
 remains unchanged.  Position of previously described small caliber drainage
 catheter is also unchanged.  Noteworthy is that the posterior pleural sinus
 density has clearly regressed on the right side, favoring the assumption that
 the density is organized and no free fluid remains.  The left hemithorax
 remains normal and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right-sided pleural density without signs of
 progression.
