                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been a dramatic
 increase in opacification at the right base consistent with large pleural
 effusion and compensatory atelectasis of the right lower lung.
 
 There is some increased indistinctness of pulmonary vessels in the left lower
 lung, raising the possibility of some overhydration.
