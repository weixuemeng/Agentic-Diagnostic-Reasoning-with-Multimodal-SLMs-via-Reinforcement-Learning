                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided Port-A-Catheter is unchanged in position, terminating in
 the mid superior vena cava.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits without change.  Small right pleural effusion appears
 similar to the prior study with pleural catheter in place and no visible
 pneumothorax.  Dominant pleural nodule at level of the right second anterior
 rib appears unchanged.  Other pleural nodules are present predominantly in the
 right mid and lower lung region and are better characterized by a recent CT. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis appears similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar radiographic appearance of left-sided Port-A-Catheter,
 terminating in the mid superior vena cava.
