                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 pulmonary vasculature has increased consistent with moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion/pulmonary edema.  Nodular opacity projecting in the right
 upper lobe and right lower lobe may be osseous or pulmonary in nature; could
 relate to known pulmonary metastases; repeat after diuresis may be helpful for
 further evaluation.  There is linear left base atelectasis/scarring.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  The patient is status
 post kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty of lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion/pulmonary edema.  Two
 right-sided nodular opacities may be osseous or pulmonary.  The patient has
 known pulmonary metastases, although difficult to accurately compare change
 with prior CT from ___, given differences in modality.  Consider
 followup radiographs after diuresis for better evaluation.
