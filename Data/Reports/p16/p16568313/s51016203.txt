                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart failure and
 past medical history of renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 Correlation with CT of the torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Examination is somewhat limited; however, diffuse hazy
 opacification and pulmonary vascular congestion along with enlarged cardiac
 silhouette is suggestive of congestive heart failure.  The presence of
 underlying infection particularly at the bases would be difficult to exclude. 
 No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions, if any, are small.  There is tortuosity
 of the aorta.  Note is made of kyphoplasty in the lower thoracic spine. 
 Multiple known osseous lesions are better evaluated on the recent CT
 examination of ___.  Known right-sided pulmonary nodules are
 also better evaluated on the prior CT.
