                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with worsening shortness of breath and
 wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Of note, there is a mislabeling of the PA image with the side being
 marked as "left" actually being the right side of the patient.
 
 PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate expanded lungs.  There is
 significant interval increase in the opacity of the perihilar areas and the
 mid lung zones with associated enlarged vascular diameter, peribronchial
 cuffing, and a fluid-marked major fissure best seen on the lateral image. 
 These findings are consistent with an acute pulmonary edema, infection, or
 both.  No pleural effusions are seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  The dense opacity overlying the right heart and spine on PA
 view is radiopaque cement from a vertebroplasty and does not require followup.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval increase in opacity of perihilar and mid
 lung areas bilaterally, concerning for pulmonary edema, infection, or both.
 
 The medical team was paged at 11:55 to communicate these findings.
