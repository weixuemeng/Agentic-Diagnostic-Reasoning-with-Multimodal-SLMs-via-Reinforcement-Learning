                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Assessment of parenchymal infiltrates.
 
 Currently AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, extensive perihilar, mid lung and lower lobe
 opacities are unchanged or minimally increased.  Still no appreciable pleural
 effusion is demonstrated making pulmonary edema less likely  and infectious
 process being more likely as well as extensive interstitial process of unclear
 etiology.  Another option such as lymphangitic spread of the tumor given the
 known metastatic renal tumor is another possibility.
