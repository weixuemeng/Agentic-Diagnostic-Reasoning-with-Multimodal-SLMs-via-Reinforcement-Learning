                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness, shortness of breath, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates stable severe
 cardiomegaly.  Evaluation of the lungs is limited by poor inspiratory effort. 
 Within this limitation, there is bronchial cuffing and perihilar
 opacifications, most consistent with pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 opacifications likely reflect a combination of edema and atelectasis, though
 superimposed infection is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 opacifications, likely atelectasis and edema though infection not excluded.
