                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with fall with question of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with patient
 positioned upright.  Bibasilar linear opacities could represent atelectasis,
 less likely reflective of pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  No acute bony
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear densities in lower lungs, most compatible with
 atelectasis.
