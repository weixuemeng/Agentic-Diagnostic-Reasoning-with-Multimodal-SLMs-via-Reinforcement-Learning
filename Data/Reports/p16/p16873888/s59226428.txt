                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with a right rhonchi.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs,
 which could be within normal limits given the relatively narrow AP diameter of
 the chest.  No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
