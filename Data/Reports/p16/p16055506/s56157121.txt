 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stab wounds, evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The left hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated with a prominent
 amount of gas within the stomach.  Patchy opacity at the left base likely
 reflects atelectasis, though an early infectious process should also be
 considered.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A minimal
 amount of air within the left lateral chest wall soft tissues is again seen.
