                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after chest tube removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  The pigtail catheter on the left
 has been removed.  The current examination demonstrates questionable minimal
 left apical pneumothorax.  The anterior loculation of air is suspected on the
 lateral view.  Small amount of pneumoperitoneum is seen, diminished since the
 prior study.
 
 The overall amount of subcutaneous air within the anterior aspect of the left
 chest appears to be gradually decreasing.  No pleural effusion seen.
