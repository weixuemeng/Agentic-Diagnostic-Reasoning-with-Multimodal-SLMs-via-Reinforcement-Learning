                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of
 the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with diffuse increased interstitial markings, similar to the
 previous exam, suggestive of a mild chronic interstitial lung disease.  No new
 focal consolidation ,left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present. 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the lateral view may suggest the
 presence of a trace pleural effusion.  There is diffuse demineralization of
 the osseous structures.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body appears new when compared to the previous exam.  An inferior vena cava
 filter is partially imaged within the upper abdomen.  There are clips noted
 within the left axilla and postoperative changes in the left breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggestive of a trace pleural
 effusion.  Findings suggestive of mild chronic interstitial lung disease, but
 no acute process is otherwise identified.  Mild compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body which appears new when compared to the previous exam.
