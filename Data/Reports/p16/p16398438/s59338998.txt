 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multi-trauma after falling out of tree.
 Spoke with radiology in AM. Concern for RLL pneumatocele vs lung lac and
 recommended repeat x-ray in PM  // ?Worsening of lower lobe opacities?   
 ?Worsening of lower lobe opacities?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a small residual
 right apical pneumothorax.  Basilar opacifications are again seen, especially
 on the right.  In view of the clinical history, this could represent pulmonary
 contusion or aspiration.  The right chest tube remains in place.
 The striking dilatation of the gas filled stomach seen on the previous study
 is not appreciated at this time.
