                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PUD, gastric outlet obstruction  // please
 eval upper lung predominant fibronodular opacities, left greater than right,
 noted on recent portable CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen, except
 that the nasogastric tube has been removed.
 Bilateral apical fibronodular opacities are unchanged as compared to the
 previous image.  They are most likely due to old infection, potentially TB.  A
 further evaluation of the changes would be possible by CT.  Unchanged
 retrocardiac platelike atelectasis.  Mild overinflation.  Minimal right
 pleural effusion.
