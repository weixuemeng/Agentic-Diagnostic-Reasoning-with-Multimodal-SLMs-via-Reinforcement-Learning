                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of TKI-induced effusion. 
 Evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size is unchanged, remains within normal limits.
 Being aware from old records that the patient has signs of moderate degree of
 pulmonary hypertension, one can identify a relative prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery and that of the central pulmonary vessels.  The periphery,
 however, remains unremarkable and no new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates
 have developed.  The left-sided pleural effusion is again seen to blunt the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.  Direct comparison of both frontal and
 lateral view clearly indicates that the amount of pleural effusion has again
 increased slightly in comparison with the examination of ___. 
 Still the overall amount of pleural effusion must be considered a small.  No
 pneumothorax has developed and no other radiographic abnormalities can be
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase of left-sided pleural effusion apparently induced
 by TKI administration (does this stand for tyrosine kinase inhibitor?).
