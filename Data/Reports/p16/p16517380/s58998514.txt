                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R chest tube pull // ? R PNX after chest pull
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Diffuse bilateral infiltrates are
 stable over the interval, and likely represent a combination of atelectasis
 and pulmonary edema.  There has been interval removal of the right-sided chest
 tube.  Dense retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis. Small
 left-sided pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. No pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas in the bilateral supraclavicular
 soft tissues is slightly increased as compared to the prior.I
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No pneumothorax. Slight interval increase in subcutaneous gas in the
 bilateral supraclavicular soft tissues is concerning for air leak.
 2. Diffuse bilateral infiltrates are stable over the interval, and likely
 represent a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. New dense
 retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ telephone at 12:59pm on ___, 30 minutes after discovery.
