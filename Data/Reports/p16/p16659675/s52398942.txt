 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fall, confusion, metastatic breast cancer
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with tip poorly visualized due to overlying AICD wires. AICD
 leads appear unchanged with leads extending to the region the right atrium,
 right ventricle and coronary sinus. The lungs appear clear. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable. Diffuse sclerosis within the thoracic vertebral bodies is compatible
 with known diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process. Diffuse osseous metastasis.
