                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso of ___ and trauma chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is too high, ending 6.7 cm above carina and could be advanced for 2.5
 cm.  NG tube is in the stomach with side hole projecting at the
 gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced slightly.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The bilateral multifocal area
 of ground-glass opacities seen on CT are hard to assess on this chest x-ray,
 but has not significantly increased.  Cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The patient is here for multiple fractures secondary to trauma including lower
 limb fractures.
 
 1.  ET tube is too high and can be advanced for 2.5 cm.
 
 2.  NG tube projects in the stomach but the side port is at the
 gastroesophageal junction and could also be advanced.
 
 3.  Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities described in the recent CT
 torso are difficult to assess on this chest x-ray, but they have not
 significantly increased.  They are nonspecific.  The differential diagnosis
 includes fat embolism, considering the femoral fracture.  
 
 The results hav been discussed with the ICU team, DR ___.
