                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with change in mental status. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. Compared with prior radiograph there is interval
 development  of patchy opacities in the right lower lung, including both the
 cardiophrenic and costophrenic angles. Streaky opacities in the left lung base
 are not significantly changed compared with prior radiographs dating back to
 ___ and compatible with chronic change/scarring/fibrosis. Mild vascular
 congestion is present. Cardiac size cannot be properly assessed due to
 technical factors. A left-sided pacemaker is redemonstrated with the leads
 ending in appropriate position. There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New consolidations in the right lower lung are suggestive of alveolar process,
 pneumonia versus aspiration.  Mild vascular congestion.
