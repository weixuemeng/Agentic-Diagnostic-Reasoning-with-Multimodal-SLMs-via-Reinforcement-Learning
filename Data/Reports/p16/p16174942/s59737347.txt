                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ongoing altered mental status  // Any
 evidence of aspiration or pna?      Any evidence of aspiration or pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a
 patient with prior CABG procedure and dual-channel pacer with leads in good
 position.  Prominence of interstitial markings is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure, though it has a coarse configuration that also
 raises the possibility of underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  Dense streak
 of atelectasis is seen at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
