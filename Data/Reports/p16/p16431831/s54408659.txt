                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis  // evidence of pna vs effusion     
 evidence of pna vs effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes with
 AC opacification bilaterally, especially on the right, consistent with
 layering pleural effusion and volume loss at the bases.  Some element of
 pulmonary vascular congestion could well be present.
 In view of the low lung volumes and extensive pulmonary changes, it is
 impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
