                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with concern for sepsis  // evidence of air under
 diaphram, pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Semi erect positioning reduces sensitivity of the chest radiograph for
 detecting free intraperitoneal air or pneumothorax.  Lateral decubitus views
 may be helpful given clinical suspicion for these entities.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as large
 right and moderate left pleural effusions, which have been more fully
 characterized by recent CTA of the chest 1 day earlier.
