                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 16:39, chest radiograph ___
 at 12:56, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are similar. Patchy opacities are re- demonstrated
 in the lung bases, compatible with a atelectasis as well as aspiration
 pneumonia, the latter better demonstrated on the recent CT.  A left PICC tip
 appears to terminate region of the left axilla, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the recent exam. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions with patchy opacities in the lung bases reflecting a combination of
 atelectasis as well as aspiration pneumonia in the left lung base. Left PICC
 again terminates within the left axillary region.
