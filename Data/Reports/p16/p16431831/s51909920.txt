                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p colectomy for cancer (ileosigmoid anastomosis) with
 complicated post-operative course, now with right pleural effusion status post
 chest tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Persistent atelectasis of the right
 lung base is again seen.  Left lung base opacity is more clear.  Of note,
 lucent line in the superolateral aspect of the right lung is most likely a
 skin fold and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax.  Right-sided pigtail
 catheter is in satisfactory position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
