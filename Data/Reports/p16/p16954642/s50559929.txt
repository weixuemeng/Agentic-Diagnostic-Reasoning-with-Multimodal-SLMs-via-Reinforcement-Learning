                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, cough and dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia. There is a nodular opacity adjacent to the
 left hilum, measuring 7 mm with an adjacent branching structure which appears
 to represent a vessel. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  The pleural surfaces are normal without effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodular opacity adjacent to the left hilum, which could possibly represent a
 vascular anomaly such as AVM or superimposition of normal vessels. Further
 evaluation can be obtained with 15 degree shallow oblique views or CT.
