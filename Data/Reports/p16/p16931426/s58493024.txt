                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post fall with rib fracture,
 evaluate rib fracture.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is present.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No mediastinal
 abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There
 exists a local pleural density blunting mildly the lateral posterior pleural
 sinus and extending into the dorsal area of the pleural space on the left side
 as seen on the lateral view.  The amount of pleural effusion is small.  It
 raises, however, the possibility of a rib fracture as the possible cause
 which, however, cannot be identified on the standard PA and lateral view
 conclusively.  Noteworthy is on the lateral view that vertebral body T12 is
 mildly anteriorly wedge shaped which may be related to preceding trauma. 
 There is no evidence of any rib fracture and displacement of bony structures
 on the chest; however, the routine PA and lateral chest views do not include
 all lower ribs completely.  It is therefore recommended to perform a dedicated
 skeletal rib examination which includes special radiographs and the use of
 metallic BB markers to identify the areas of most distinct local discomfort. 
 On the preceding chest examination of ___, a small amount of
 pleural effusion on the left side was already seen on the lateral view but
 again no skeletal structure damage was identified.
