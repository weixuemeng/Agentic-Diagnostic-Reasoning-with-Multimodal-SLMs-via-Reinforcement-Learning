                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion status post fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly appear slightly increased compared to the previous chest
 radiograph.  The mediastinal contour remains similar with rightward deviation
 of the trachea at the level of the aortic knob.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is noted, and the hilar contours are unchanged.  Lungs appear
 hyperinflated with probable underlying emphysematous changes.  A moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions are noted.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.  Diffuse increase in interstitial opacities bilaterally may
 reflect slight progression of previously noted chronic interstitial
 abnormality.  No pneumothorax is present.  Scarring is noted within both lung
 apices.  Mild to moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked cardiomegaly, increased from the previous study, with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and
 small on the right.
 2. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 3. Background of mild chronic interstitial abnormality, perhaps progressed
 since the previous chest radiograph from ___.
