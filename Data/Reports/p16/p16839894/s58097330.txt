                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with incidental note of a rounded density
 overlying the tenth posterior rib.  Eval if this is nipple shadow or within
 the lung.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Scoliosis radiograph series of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views with nipple markers demonstrate a vague opacity, which
 does not correlate with the nipple.  More specifically, it appears to extend
 above the posterior tenth rib on the first frontal view, and moves with
 respect to the anterior fifth rib on sequential views.  Findings are
 suggestive of an underlying pulmonary nodule in the right lower lung.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity projecting over the right lower lung does not correlate with the
 nipple, and is likely an pulmonary nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The above findings were entered by Dr. ___ ___ the
 ___ Imaging Findings Dashboard for communication to the ordering
 clinician at 11:23 on ___.
