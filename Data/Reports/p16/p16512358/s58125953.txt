                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:13 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with anterior mediastinal mass.  Assess for
 pneumothorax after mediastinotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest read in conjunction with a chest CT dated ___:
 
 The ___ of the severely widened mediastinum are comparable to the
 appearance on chest CT six days ago.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion, but low lung volumes are very low making it difficult to exclude
 mild edema.  I would recommend conventional chest radiographs when feasible. 
 Small right pleural effusion may be present, but there is no indication of
 pneumothorax.  Heart is top normal size.
