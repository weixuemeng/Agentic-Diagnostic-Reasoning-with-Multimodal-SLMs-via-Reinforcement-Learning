                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Asthma and with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is mild peribronchial cuffing in both lower lungs, greater on the left
 than right, which can be seen with asthma, but no definite focal opacity to
 suggest superimposed pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic spine. 
 Parenchymal detail is somewhat limited by soft tissue attenuation, and on the
 lateral, mild blurring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
