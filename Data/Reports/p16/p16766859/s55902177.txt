                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, SOB  // infilatrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Low lung
 volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures. .  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity at right lung base is nonspecific but
 potentially due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment due to low lung volumes. Repeat radiograph with improved
 inspiratory level would assist in evaluating the cardiovascular status of the
 patient and in more fully characterizing a patchy opacity at the right lung
 base.
