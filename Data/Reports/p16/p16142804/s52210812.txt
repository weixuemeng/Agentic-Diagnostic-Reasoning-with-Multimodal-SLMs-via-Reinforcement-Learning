                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 placement of tracheostomy tube which terminates 5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  A right PICC is also in place, terminating at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  EKG leads are present as well, along with a line along
 the right lateral chest wall which is likely external to the patient. 
 Bilateral alveolar opacities are increased since the prior radiograph,
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  The heart is mild to moderately
 enlarged, but stable since the most recent prior study.  No significant
 pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Interval worsening of bilateral alveolar opacities, consistent with
 moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Monitoring and support devices are in appropriate position.
