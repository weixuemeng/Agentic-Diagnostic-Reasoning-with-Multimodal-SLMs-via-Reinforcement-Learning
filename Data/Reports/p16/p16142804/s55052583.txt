                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath
 and wheezing, crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Since
 the prior study, there has been significant interval enlargement of now
 globular cardiac silhouette, raising concern for underlying pericardial
 effusion.  There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not well seen, which may be due to overlying soft
 tissue, although a small pleural effusion is not excluded.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval increase in size of cardiac silhouette which
 is globular in configuration, concerning for underlying pericardial effusion. 
 Possible minimal-to-mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is most likely due to
 overlying soft tissue, although a trace pleural effusion is not excluded.
