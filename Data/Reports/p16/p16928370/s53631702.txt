                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea.  Evaluate chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.
 
 The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  There is a relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour, finding which in conjunction with
 the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the possibility
 of systemic hypertension.  Calcifications of the aortic wall are again noted
 and appear stable.  No significant enlargement of the left atrium can be
 identified and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  Apical areas clear on the frontal view.  Moderately
 demineralized vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine with accentuated kyphotic
 curvature, but no evidence of vertebral body compression fractures.  When
 comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination, no significant
 interval change can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute CHF or new parenchymal infiltrates in this
 ___-year-old female patient with history of dyspnea.
