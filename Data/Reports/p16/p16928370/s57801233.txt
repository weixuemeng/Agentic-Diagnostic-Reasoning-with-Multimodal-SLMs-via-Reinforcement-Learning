                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of tongue cancer who presents
 with nausea, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x ray, neck CT from ___
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Allowing for
 differences in technique, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch.  Lungs are symmetrically
 expanded.  Previously noted increased opacification at the right base and
 small right pleural effusion have resolved.  Nodular opacity projecting over
 the upper thoracic spine on the lateral view is likely nodule at the right
 lung apex seen on neck CT.  It is not clearly seen on the frontal likely
 secondary to rotation.  There is no definite focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Chronic deformity of the proximal right humerus
 and exaggerated thoracic kyphosis with degenerative changes are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Interval resolution of right lower lobe opacification and small right
 pleural effusion without evidence of new focal areas of consolidation.
 2. Nodular opacity projecting over upper thoracic spine on the lateral view is
 likely nodule seen at the lung apex on prior neck CT and was suspicious for
 malignancy.  Dedicated nonurgent chest CT suggested.
