                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post tracheostomy and NG tube
 placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination ___ ___.  Mild cardiac enlargement as
 before.  Unchanged general widening and elongation of the thoracic aorta with
 walled calcifications.  No significant interval change.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested, and there are no signs of new acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates in comparison with the previous study.  A tracheostomy
 has been performed, and the cannula is seen to terminate in the trachea some 6
 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The
 portable chest examination does not demonstrate any suspicious contours that
 would indicate a pneumomediastinum.  The NG tube of Dobbhoff type has been
 advanced that reaches well below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful tracheostomy without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Dobbhoff line reaches well into the stomach.
