                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate increased
 opacity projecting over the right middle lobe.  There is obscuration of the
 right heart border and increased interstitial markings, slightly more
 peripherally.  These findings appear slightly more conspicuous on the current
 exam with more dense consolidative component potentially due to progression of
 disease.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Surgical clips are seen in the
 region of the AP window.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increased opacity projecting in the region of the right
 middle lobe, worrisome for progression of disease although superimposed
 infection is also possible.
