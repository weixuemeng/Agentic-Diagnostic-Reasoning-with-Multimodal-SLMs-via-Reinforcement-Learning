                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Lungs are low in
 volume with linear opacities in right lung which could reflect atelectasis or
 aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The ET tube is 2
 cm above the carina, but given the degree of kyphotic positioning could be in
 standard position.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the fundus of the stomach.
 Left clavicular fracture and right rib fractures appear chronic. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear right lung opacities could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube is 2 cm above the carina.  It is likely satisfactorily
 positioned given degree of kyphotic positioning, but it should not be advanced
 any further.
