                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough/wheezing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is of unknown
 chronicity. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is present. The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable given the presence of low lung volumes.
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity.
