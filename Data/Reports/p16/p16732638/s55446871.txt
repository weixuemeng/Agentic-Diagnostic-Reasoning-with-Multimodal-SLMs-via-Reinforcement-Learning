                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAYS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary
 artery bypass surgery.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  An area of poorly defined opacity is present in
 the left infrahilar region with an adjacent linear area of atelectasis.  Right
 lung is grossly clear.  No definite pleural effusion. Mild elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific left infrahilar opacity, which may represent
 atelectasis or a developing pneumonia given the clinical suspicion for this
 entity.
