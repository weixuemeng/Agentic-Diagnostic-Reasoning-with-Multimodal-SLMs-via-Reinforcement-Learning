                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain, question
 and evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings,
 particularly at the lung bases.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 No focal consolidation.
