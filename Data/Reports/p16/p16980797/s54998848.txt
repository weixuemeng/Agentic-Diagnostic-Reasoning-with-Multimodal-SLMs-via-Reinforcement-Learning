                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p mechanical fall, -LOC, with L ___th rib
 fxs with pulm contusions.  // Assess pulmonary contusion.     Assess pulmonary
 contusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs most recently ___, read in
 conjunction with recent chest CT following trauma, ___.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation suggests small airway obstruction.  Multifocal peribronchial
 infiltration in the mid and lower lung zones and a region of consolidation in
 the lingula, shown on the CT, is generally not apparent.  The most obvious
 remaining lesion is in the right midlung.  This is more likely pneumonia
 rather than multifocal pulmonary contusion.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is long-standing, an the CT scan showed severe pulmonary
 hypertension.  Small blunting of the posterior pleural sulci is due to small
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected
 courses.  Small pericardial effusion seen on the chest CT scan could still be
 present but there is no indication of tamponade physiology.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional chest radiographs it symptoms develop
 or at most in 4 weeks to go document clearing of any active infection.
