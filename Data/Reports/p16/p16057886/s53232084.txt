                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory arrest status post failed intubation with
 emergent cric then PEA arrest.  Assess positioning of ET tube, rule out
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 321.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube has been withdrawn now ending 2.4 cm above the carina.  No
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is present.  The there is interval
 improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.  Aeration of the
 left lower lung is improved; however, persistent basilar opacification is
 likely related to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube tip now 2.4 cm above the carina.
 
 2. No evidence of pneumomediastinum.
 
 3. Improving pulmonary vascular congestion.
