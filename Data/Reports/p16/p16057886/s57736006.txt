                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:11 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with a PIC line.  Tracheal cancer with
 tracheostomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Tip of the right PIC line is at a level approximately 7.5 cm below the carina
 and could be withdrawn 3 cm for positioning low in the SVC.  Bibasilar
 opacification is probably a combination of small pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis but one cannot exclude early pneumonia.  Stomach is
 moderately to severely distended with air and fluid.  Heart is borderline
 enlarged, but upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
