                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged, again featuring enlarged central pulmonary arteries raising
 concern for pulmonary arterial hypertension that could be seen with intrinsic
 lung disease.  Markedly irregular lung architecture with areas of multifocal
 scarring and hyperinflation suggest severe emphysema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  What is new is superimposed opacity in the right
 lower lobe suggesting pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in the right lower lobe suggesting pneumonia
 superimposed on severe background emphysema including areas of multifocal
 scarring and bullous change.
