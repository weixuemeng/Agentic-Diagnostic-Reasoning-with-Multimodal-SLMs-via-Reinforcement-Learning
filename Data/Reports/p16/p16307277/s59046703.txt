                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of COPD, now with persistent
 shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Again seen is severe bilateral emphysema, predominant in the
 lower lobes, consistent with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.  Enlargement of
 pulmonary arteries suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. Linear areas of
 focal lung scarring are unchanged.  No new consolidation, pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bibasilar predominant emphysema, in keeping with alpha
 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Enlarged pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension, unchanged.
