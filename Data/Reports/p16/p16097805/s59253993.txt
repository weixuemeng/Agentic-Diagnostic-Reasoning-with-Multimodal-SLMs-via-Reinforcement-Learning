                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cavitary pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement of the pre-existing cavitary lesion in the paraaortic lung
 regions.  The cavity has increased in size, but the border of the cavity has
 decreased in thickness.  Further followup, however, is required despite this
 improvement.
 
 No complications.  No reactive pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
