                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of a cavitary lung lesion after
 necrotizing pneumonia.  The patient is now improved clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The bulk of the left upper lobe cavitary process substantially cleared between
 ___ and ___.  This could be a small residual cavity in the left
 suprahilar lung, but in the absence of signs or symptoms of active infection,
 there is no particular need to document what would be either a post-infectious
 pneumatocele or segment of bronchiectasis with CT scanning.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.
