                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with congestive heart failure, question
 improvement in pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 811.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral interstitial process which has somewhat improved suggesting
 resolving interstitial edema.  However, there continues to be focal airspace
 opacity in the right upper lobe, which would be concerning for superimposed
 pneumonia or aspiration.  In addition, there has been interval development of
 a subtle opacity at the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis,
 pneumonia, or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pleural
 effusions are seen.  Heart remains stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 also unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
