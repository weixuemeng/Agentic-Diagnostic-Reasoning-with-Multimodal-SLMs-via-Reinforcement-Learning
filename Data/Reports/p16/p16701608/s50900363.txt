                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardia dementia  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  Chronic
 deformity of multiple right-sided ribs from prior fractures noted, with
 overall volume loss of the right lung as compared to the left.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  There is subtle splaying of the carina which can be
 seen with left atrial enlargement.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 Evidence of a large hiatal hernia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Small right pleural effusion.  Chronic deformity of the
 right-sided ribs with overall volume loss of the right lung as compared to the
 left.  No definite focal consolidation is seen although this would be
 difficult to exclude at the right lung base.
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Large hiatal hernia.
