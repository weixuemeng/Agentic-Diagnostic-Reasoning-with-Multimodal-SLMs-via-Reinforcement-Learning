                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with heart failure now with new oxygen
 requirement in setting of possible aspiration.  // Evidence of aspiration?
 Pulmonary edema?     Evidence of aspiration? Pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Left lung shows no pulmonary edema, only mild left basal atelectasis, adjacent
 to small hiatus hernia.  Heterogeneous opacification in the right midlung
 could be due in part to pleural thickening adjacent to prior rib fractures,
 but is concerning for recent aspiration.  Right pleural scarring is likely but
 there could be a very small right pleural effusion.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Calcified
 mediastinal lymph node projecting over the right main bronchus should not be
 mistaken for an aspirated tooth.
