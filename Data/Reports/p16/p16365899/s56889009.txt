                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p unrestrained MVC, ejected, w/ R PTX, right ___, ___ rib
 fx, right scapula fx  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:00
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been improvement in the right upper zone
 pneumothorax. A small residual pneumothorax is likely present. There are
 improved inspiratory volumes, with near complete resolution of the opacities
 that were previously seen at the lung bases. No new focal opacity and no
 effusion is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is improved. Heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 Multiple fractures depicted on the ___ chest CT are less apparent
 radiographically. However, AC joint separation on the right is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Near complete resolution of bibasilar opacities, with improved inspiratory
 volumes.
 3. Right AC joint separation noted. Multiple known fractures not well depicted
 radiographically.
