                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pneumothorax after motor vehicle crash. Evaluate for
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a residual small right pneumothorax and small right pleural effusion.
 Assessment for change is difficult given the differences in modalites, though
 no large change in the size is identified.
 
 An opacity at the right base likely represents  atelectasis and has increased
 since the initial radiograph.  Superimposed infection/aspiration is difficult
 to exclude.  There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal. The known right rib fractures are better assessed on the
 prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small right pneumothorax and small right pleural effusion. Assessment for
 change is difficult given the differences in modality, though no significant
 change is appreciated.
 2. Increasing right basilar consolidation, likely contusion and atelectasis.
 Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
