                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  There is new
 partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and increased density over the
 spine on the lateral view, possibly due to pneumonia.  Mild chronic pulmonary
 vascular congestion is unchanged from the prior exam.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and unchanged.
 A pacemaker overlies the left chest with the leads in appropriate position in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post a CABG. 
 Sternal wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and increased density in the
 left lower lobe on the lateral view, possibly due to a developing pneumonia in
 this region.  Short term follow-up with a repeat chest radiograph is
 recommended. 
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:15 AM on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___ ___ minutes after the findings were discovered.
