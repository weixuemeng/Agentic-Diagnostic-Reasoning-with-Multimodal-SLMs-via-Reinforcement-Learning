                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Low lung volumes causes
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Clips are demonstrated within the upper
 abdomen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
