 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided AICD is stable in positions.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes remain low.  Subtle bibasilar
 opacities are felt to more likely be due to atelectasis or aspiration rather
 than pneumonia from infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is likely a hiatal
 hernia.

 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis or possibly aspiration.  No
 definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
