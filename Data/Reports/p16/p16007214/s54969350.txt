                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, STEMI.  Rule out acute cardiopulmonary disease,
 dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  A left-sided pacemaker
 device is again noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, expected locations.  Cardiomegaly is stable. The mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is redemonstration of increased opacities at the lung bases
 bilaterally, slightly more prominent on the right when compared to prior
 examination. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased bibasilar opacities in the setting of low lung volumes are likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Evaluation for dissection is limited on chest
 x-ray, however mediastinal contours are stable.
