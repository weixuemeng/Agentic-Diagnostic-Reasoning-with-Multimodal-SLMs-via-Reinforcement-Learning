                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided AICD/
 pacemaker device is noted in unchanged positions in the right atrium and right
 ventricle. Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result of
 low lung volumes. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
