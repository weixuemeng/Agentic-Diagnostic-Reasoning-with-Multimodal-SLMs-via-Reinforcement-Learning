                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are low which causes crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  Additionally, there is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 is present.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
