                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST; ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Left hemidiaphragm now appears well defined on the lateral view,
 suggesting resolution of the focal ___-___ opacity on the prior
 study.  Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged, and ICD remains in place with
 leads in right atrium and right ventricle.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 Moderate gastric distention is observed in the imaged portion of the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapid improvement of left lower lobe opacity favors either
 aspiration or atelectasis as the likely etiology.
