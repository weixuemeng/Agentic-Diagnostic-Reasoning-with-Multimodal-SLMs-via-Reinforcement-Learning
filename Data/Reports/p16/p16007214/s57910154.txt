 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p fall*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with

 or fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AICD is unchanged in position, with leads extending to the region of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
 are again seen.  Lung volumes remain low, causing crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles could be
 secondary to a small amount of pleural effusion.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The heart remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax identified.
 No definite focal consolidation.  Osseous structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable small
 pleural effusions.
