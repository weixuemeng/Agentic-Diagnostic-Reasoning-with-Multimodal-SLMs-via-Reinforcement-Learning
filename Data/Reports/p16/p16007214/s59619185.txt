                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain at the site of pacer in the left chest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with intact leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, though probably accentuated due to the
 presence of low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases are similar compared to the prior exam, likely reflecting atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Pacing leads in
 unchanged positions and appear intact.
