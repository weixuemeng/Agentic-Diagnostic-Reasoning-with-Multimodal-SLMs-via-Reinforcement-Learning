                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The lung volumes are low, which accentuate late the bronchovascular markings;
 however, there appears to be slight interval worsening of diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary edema compared to the prior exam.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Pacemaker leads are unchanged in position.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis;
 however, a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There is no
 large pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacities likely secondary to atelectasis; however, a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
