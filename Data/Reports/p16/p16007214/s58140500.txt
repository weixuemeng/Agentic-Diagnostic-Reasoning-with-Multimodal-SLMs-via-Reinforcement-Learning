                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Low
 lung volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures, without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likelyreflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
