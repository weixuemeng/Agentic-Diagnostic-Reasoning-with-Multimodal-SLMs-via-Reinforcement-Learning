                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the most recent prior study from ___.  Comparison is also made to prior radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate relatively low lung
 volumes, with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 heart size, which is mildly enlarged, but stable compared to prior studies. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 present.  A left chest wall dual-lead pacemaker/defibrillator is unchanged in
 position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Mediastinal clips and intact median sternotomy wires are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and stable mild cardiomegaly.
