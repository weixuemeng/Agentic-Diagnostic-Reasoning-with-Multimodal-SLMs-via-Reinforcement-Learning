                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  A left chest wall
 pacer-defibrillator has leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Numerous surgical clips project over the anterior mediastinum from
 prior coronary artery bypass.  Lung volumes are slightly low similar to the
 prior study.  Previous pulmonary edema is significantly improved except for
 residual and some atelectasis in the lung bases.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
