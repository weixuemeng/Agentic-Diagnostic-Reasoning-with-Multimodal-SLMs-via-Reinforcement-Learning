                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with coronary artery disease with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are again
 noted.  There is, however, increased interstitial marking throughout the lungs
 as on prior, compatible with mild edema.  Bibasilar opacities are most likely
 due to atelectasis.  There is no large effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 stable.  Left chest wall dual-lead pacing device is again seen as well as
 median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Mild edema.
