                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, possible dyspnea (poor historian)  //
 evaluate for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   AICD is unchanged in position
 with leads extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle.
 Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. Lung volumes
 are low. Crowding of bronchovascular markings in the lower lungs likely
 accounts for the subtle opacities noted, unchanged significantly from prior.
 Difficult to exclude mild bibasilar atelectasis or a component of mild
 aspiration/PNA. The heart remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is
 normal. No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities likely bronchovascular crowding, atelectasis, less
 likely aspiration/ pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly again seen.
