                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning, AP technique,
 and low lung volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases,
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  There are no acutely displaced fractures.  Degenerative
 changes are seen involving both acromioclavicular joints and within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
