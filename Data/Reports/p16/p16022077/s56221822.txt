                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for
 assessment of a nasogastric tube, which has been withdrawn since the prior
 study.  Although the tip is likely in the proximal stomach, the side port is
 anticipated to be above the GE junction level.  Interval removal of
 endotracheal tube.  Stable cardiomediastinal contours.  Worsening bilateral
 pleural effusions, moderate to large on the right and moderate on the left
 with adjacent areas of lower lung consolidation and/or atelectasis.
