 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.

 Again seen is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, similar in configuration
 compared to prior.  There is no large effusion or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no consolidation.  Blunting of the left posterior
 costophrenic angle is likely due to a left Bochdalek's hernia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is a moderate-sized hiatal
 hernia.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic.  Degenerative changes noted at the
 shoulders bilaterally.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
