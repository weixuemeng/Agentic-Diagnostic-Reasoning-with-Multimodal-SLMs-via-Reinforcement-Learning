 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying basilar consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The bones
 are diffusely osteopenic.  The left humeral head is high riding which can be
 seen in rotator cuff disease.  Again seen are at least two ossific structures
 projecting over the right scapula which measure up to 1.2 cm, also present on
 the prior, may represent loose bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying left basilar consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
