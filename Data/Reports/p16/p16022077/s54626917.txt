                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax after CPR
 with chest tubes currently on mechanical ventilation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.  The two left pigtail catheters
 placed.  There is no interval progression of pneumothorax or development of
 pleural effusion.  Right lung assessment demonstrates mild opacification,
 unchanged since the prior study with potential interval decrease in
 subcutaneous air.  Small right pleural effusion is noted.  No overt
 pneumothorax on the right is demonstrated.
