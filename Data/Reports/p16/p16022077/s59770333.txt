 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.  Respiratory failure. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:43 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 is slightly coiled in the stomach and currently projects over the
 mid-to-distal parts of the organ.
 
 The endotracheal tube remains in situ.  A moderate predominantly lateral basal
 left pneumothorax is seen in unchanged manner with air collection in the soft
 tissues.  The appearance of the right lung and of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.
