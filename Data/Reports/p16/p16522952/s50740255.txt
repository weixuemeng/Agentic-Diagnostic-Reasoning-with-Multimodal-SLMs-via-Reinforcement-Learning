                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT torso dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recurrent AFib, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A large
 retrocardiac opacity containing an air-fluid level is compatible with a known
 hiatal hernia.  There is a vague opacity at the left lung base which could
 represent pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There may be a tiny
 left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size appears stable. 
 Mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  Subtle opacity in the left lung base may
 represent pneumonia or aspiration.
