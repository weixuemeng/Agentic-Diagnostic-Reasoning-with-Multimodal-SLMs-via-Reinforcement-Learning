                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at outside institution, at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left retrocardiac opacity is seen which raises concern for pleural
 effusion with possible atelectasis underlying consolidation not excluded. 
 However, there appears to be some lucencies within the region of opacity which
 could be due to necrosis/infection however, hernia with bowel content is not
 entirely excluded.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax seen.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity could be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  However,
 there are also
 appear to be subtle areas of lucency within and necrosis/other infection or
 herniated GI tract is not excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be
 helpful for further evaluation if patient able.
