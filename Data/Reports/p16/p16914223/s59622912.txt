                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the right superior mediastinal
 contour is concerning for underlying lymphadenopathy or mass which appears to
 be primarily posterior in location, narrowing and displacing the trachea
 anteriorly.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. There may be trace bilateral
 pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Abnormal widening of the right superior mediastinal contour, concerning for
 a posterior mediastinal mass which narrows and deviates the trachea
 anteriorly. Further assessment with CT with contrast is suggested.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
