 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasoenteric tube is present. The tip overlies the distal stomach. Of note,
 the radiopaque portion is not the same size as on the prior film, suggesting a
 different tube.
 
 Compared with the prior film common inspiratory volumes are slightly lower the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is more prominent. Films also were lordotic .
 Allowing for technical differences, no definite interval change. No overt CHF
 or focal consolidation. No effusion. No findings suggestive of aspiration.
