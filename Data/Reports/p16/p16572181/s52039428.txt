                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall from chair.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA, repeat PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with unfolding of the thoracic aorta is unchanged from the
 prior examination. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Hilar contours are
 normal. Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Posterior bibasilar densities correspond
 to Bochdalek's hernia as on the prior CT examination. Pleural surfaces are
 clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Generalized demineralized appearance
 of the bones limits sensitivity for fracture. Within that context there is no
 overt traumatic finding.  Cervical fixation hardware is visualized.  The known
 T1 and T2 fractures are better evaluated on the cervical spine CT and are not
 well seen on radiograph.Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No overt traumatic findings though
 diffuse osseous demineralization limits sensitivity for fracture detection.
