                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intracranial hemorrhage after MVC, for tube position and possible
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 lies approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends well into
 the stomach.  Obliquity of the patient somewhat obscures detail.  However,
 there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or definite pneumothorax.
