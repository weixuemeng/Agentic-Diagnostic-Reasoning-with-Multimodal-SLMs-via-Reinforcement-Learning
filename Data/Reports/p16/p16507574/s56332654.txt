                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, evaluation for rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding. There is no
 focal consolidation.  There is mild interstitial edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and normal hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. No definitive rib fracture is seen. Visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild vascular plethora.  No pneumothorax.  If there is persistent concern for
 rib fracture, a dedicated rib series may be obtained.
