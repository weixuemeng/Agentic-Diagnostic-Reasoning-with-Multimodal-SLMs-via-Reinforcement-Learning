 INDICATION:  Fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Mild bibasilar patchy airspace opacities are new since ___.  The cardiophrenic angles are blunted.  Presence of small effusions is
 difficult to ascertain without a lateral projection.  Cardiomegaly is
 moderate.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar patchy airspace opacities may reflect infection,
 aspiration, or atelectasis.  A lateral view would help to evaluate for small
 effusions.
