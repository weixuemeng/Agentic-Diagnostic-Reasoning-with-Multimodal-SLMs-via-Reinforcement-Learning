                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Febrile neutropenia, pseudomonas bacteremia, multiple myeloma and
 persistent fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are persistent opacities in the
 left lower lobe in the lingula as well as in the right lower lung, probably in
 the right lower lobe.  However, opacities have generally improved somewhat. 
 The overall pulmonary vascularity appears decreased in prominence suggesting
 resolution of coinciding pulmonary congestion.  An inferior vena cava filter
 is noted in the upper abdomen to the right of midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia with improvement. 
 Resolution of pulmonary congestion.
