                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of acute myelocytic
 leukemia, neutropenia and prior multi-focal pneumonia with ongoing respiratory
 symptoms.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size remains normal and appearance of
 moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta is unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  The on previous examination remaining subtle
 remnants after previously identified multifocal infiltrates have further
 decreased and can be hardly identified.  On comparison with the findings of
 ___ when the scattered slightly confluenting parenchymal densities
 in the left lower lobe area were more marked, the improvement is significant. 
 Comparison is therefore extended to an older examination of ___,
 and hardly any significant difference can be identified.
 
 Radiologically, it is concluded that the multifocal pneumonic infiltrates have
 healed and only minor interstitial scar formations remain.  Should clinical
 symptomatology continue, a further followup in two weeks is recommended. 
 Dependent on findings, decision could be made if high definition CT
 examination should be used.
