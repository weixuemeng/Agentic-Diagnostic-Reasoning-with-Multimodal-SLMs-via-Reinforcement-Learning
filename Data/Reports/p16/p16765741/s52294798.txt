                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, congestion.  // r/o infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  On the frontal radiograph, lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear. On the lateral view, a subtle rounded opacity
 projects in the retrosternal region, measuring approximately 3 cm in
 craniocaudad dimension. Considering the slightly obliqued positioning on the
 lateral view, this could potentially represent superimposition of the
 patient's breast prosthesis rather than a true lung or mediastinal
 abnormality. There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Questionable retrosternal opacity on lateral view, for which repeat
 lateral view with improved positioning is recommended for initial further
 evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 14:27 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
