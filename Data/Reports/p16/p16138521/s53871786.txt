                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?aspiration pneumonia  // interval
 assessment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged and within normal limits.  The patient is
 intubated, the endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  A Dobhoff tube terminates in the stomach.  A right internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the
 right brachiocephalic vein.  These are unchanged in appearance when compared
 to the prior studies.
 
 There is increased opacity at the left lung base, likely reflecting
 atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  No other areas
 concerning for infection are identified.  There is likely a small left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation have progressed when compared
 to the prior study.
