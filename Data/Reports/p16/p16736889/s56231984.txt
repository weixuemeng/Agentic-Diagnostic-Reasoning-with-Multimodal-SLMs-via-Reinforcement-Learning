                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HIV and fever, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside hospital chest radiograph performed
 the same day as well as CT torso performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Unremarkable cardiomediastinal contours.  Right lower lobe
 opacification consistent with known Kaposi's sarcoma tumor infiltration
 unchanged compared to ___ chest radiograph. There is increased
 prominence of the interstitium suggesting mild background pulmonary edema. 
 Stable elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  Slight blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusion.  Lateral view
 demonstrates a possible area of loculated pleural effusion versus pleural
 thickening on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right lower lung opacification consistent with Kaposi's
 sarcoma. Mild background pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Possible small leftsided loculated pleural effusion versus thickening.
