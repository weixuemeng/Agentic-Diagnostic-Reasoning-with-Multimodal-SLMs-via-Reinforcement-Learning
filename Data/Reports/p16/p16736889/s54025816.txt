                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pleurodesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left-sided basilar chest tube in place.  The amount of pleural
 effusion appears decreased since the prior examination.  However, there does
 appear to be a small left-sided pneumothorax, measuring up to 8 mm along the
 lateral aspect of the lung.
 
 There is persistence of mild increased opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region, consistent with atelectasis.
 
 There is a diffuse alveolar and interstitial process involving the right
 hemithorax, although uncertain whether this is due to the portable technique
 and slightly decreased penetration.  There is suggestion of a layering
 right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  A new left-sided basilar chest tube with decreased pleural effusion and a
 small left pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Suggestion of slight increased opacity in the right parahilar region,
 although this may be secondary to differences in technique.
