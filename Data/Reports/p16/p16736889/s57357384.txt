                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___, at 7:23 a.m.
 
 There has been interval placement of a pigtail type catheter over the lower
 left lung.  The previously seen two catheters remain present, similar in
 position. 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the opacity along the left chest wall thought to
 represent a loculated pleural effusion has decreased considerably in size.  A
 small amount of fluid along the left chest wall as well as a small left
 pleural effusion remain present.  The small lucent locules seen in the left
 upper lung are less apparent, but may still be present.  There is new faint
 linear density in the left mid zone, which may represent an area of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Increased retrocardiac density is similar to prior.
 
 
 Patchy opacity at the right lung, minimal pleural fluid or thickening along
 the right chest wall with blunting of the right costophrenic angle, and
 thickening of the right minor fissure are similar to prior.  
 
 Doubt CHF.  No other evidence of pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval placement of left pigtail type catheter over lower left lung, with
 marked decrease in the size of the presumed loculated left pleural effusion.  
 
 2) Small locules of air, question related to pneumothorax. may still be
 present.  No other evidence of pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 3) Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change except for faint atelectasis
 in the left mid lung.
