                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chylothorax followup.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:24 p.m.
 
 Three left-sided chest tubes are present. The third tube is coiled and
 overlies the base of the left lung. 
 
 The fluid collection along the left chest wall is slightly larger.  The area
 of atelectasis in left mid zone has resolved.    Again seen is patchy opacity
 at the right base, with obscuration of the right heart border, similar to
 prior.  The right midzone atelectasis or minor fissure thickening has
 resolved.  Mild right chest wall pleural thickening remains present.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in the amount of pleural fluid along the left chest
 wall.
 2.  Possible mild increase in degree of upper zone redistribution, which could
 reflect mild fluid overload.
 3.  Continued right and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
