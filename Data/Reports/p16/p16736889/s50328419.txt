                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, Kaposi's with recurrent pleural effusion status post
 thoracoscopy and talc pleurodesis, followup pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:09 a.m.
 
 Two tubes project over the left lower lung.  Again seen is the opacity along
 left mid and lower lung, thought to represent loculated pleural fluid. 
 Additional pleural fluid likely tracks along the periphery of the left chest
 wall.  This collection may measure very slightly smaller in transverse
 diameter, but is similar in superoinferior diameter. 
 
 Subtle locules of air in the left upper lung laterally could represent small
 components of pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no evidence of pneumothorax is
 identified at this time.
 
 
 As before, there is increased retrocardiac density and air bronchograms
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There are
 increased vascular markings in the left and right lungs.  There is thickening
 of the right minor fissure, suggesting slight increase in the amount of
 pleural fluid there, with thickening or fluid at the adjoining portion of the
 right chest wall and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. 
 Possible increase in vascular markings in the right lung.  There is also
 patchy opacity at the right lung base, very slightly improved.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small lucent locules along the left upper lung laterally, question small
 locules of pneumothorax.  No other evidence of pneumothorax identified at this
 time.
 
 2.  Left chest tubes noted. Loculated fluid along left chest wall may be very
 slightly smaller. 
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.
 
 4.  Vascular prominence, ? CHF.  The possibility of background increased
 interstitial markings is difficult to exclude.
 
 6.  Patchy opacity at right base, slightly improved.
