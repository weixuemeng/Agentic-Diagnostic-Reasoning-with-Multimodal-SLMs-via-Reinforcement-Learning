                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (AP and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recent pneumonia who presents with
 syncope; evaluate for interval pneumonia and CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral radiograph views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly increased right lower lobe opacity is noted with probable small right
 pleural effusion.  Bilateral pleural thickening, greater on the right compared
 to the left appears increased since the prior exam.  Increased opacity of the
 right compared to the left lung has otherwise not significantly changed from
 the prior exam. No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Stable
 osteopenia and prominent anterior osteophytes of the visualized thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval improvement in right-sided opacity with perhaps
 increased right lower lobe opacity - could represent aspiration/pneumonia, but
 consideration of chest CT is recommended to further evaluate given lack of
 improvement.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  No significant interval improvement in right-sided opacity with
 perhaps increased right lower lobe opacity - could represent
 aspiration/pneumonia, but consideration of chest CT is recommended to further
 evaluate given lack of improvement.
