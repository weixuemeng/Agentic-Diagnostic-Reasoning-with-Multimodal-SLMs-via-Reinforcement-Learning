                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough and congestion
 with no fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Prominence of main
 pulmonary arteries is noted, might potentially represent pulmonary
 hypertension, correlation with echocardiography might be suggested.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
