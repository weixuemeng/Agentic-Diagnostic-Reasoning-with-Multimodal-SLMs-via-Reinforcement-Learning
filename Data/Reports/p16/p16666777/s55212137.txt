                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and anemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated and lung volumes are low.  The visible
 aerated portions of lung demonstrate no evidence for focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is detected. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable within the limitations of a
 rotated examination.  A right neck catheter courses inferiorly with tip
 projecting over the expected location of the mid superior vena cava.  Sternal
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rotated examination with low lung volumes without evidence for
 pneumonia on this single view.
