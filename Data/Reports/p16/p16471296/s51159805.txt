                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Gastric cancer, mets to lungs, presenting with weakness
 and left chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the
 mid-to-lower SVC.  There are patchy opacities bilaterally in the lungs, most
 confluent in the right mid-to-lower lung region but also seen in the periphery
 of the left lung.  There is also slight prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature.  There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a
 small pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The cardiac silhouette
 appears top normal to mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary opacities worrisome for multifocal infection.
 However, given history of malignancy, underlying metastatic disease may also
 be present.  Possible superimposed mild fluid overload.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
