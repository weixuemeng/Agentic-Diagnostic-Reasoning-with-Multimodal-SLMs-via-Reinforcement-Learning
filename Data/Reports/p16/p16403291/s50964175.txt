                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild overinflation of the right lung, with potential partial right
 middle lobe atelectasis.  Pleural adhesion at the lateral aspects of the left
 heart border.  No evidence of acute lung changes such as pneumonia or
 pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 Comparison with old radiographs would be helpful to determine potential origin
 of the right lower lung opacity.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
