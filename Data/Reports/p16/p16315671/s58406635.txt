                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic gastric
 cancer and narrowing of gastroesophageal junction after fully covered
 esophageal stent placement with worsening dysphagia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ CT abdomen and fluoroscopy images (limited view) from ___.
 
 The AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates Port-A-Cath catheter tip
 terminating at the level of the SVC/cavoatrial junction.  The metallic stent
 is projecting over the expected location of gastroesophageal junction.
 Correlation with barium swallowing may be beneficial for precise determination
 of the position of the stent.  Alternatively, CT chest could be obtained as
 well for clarification of that question.   There is a left basal opacity most
 likely consistent with a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
