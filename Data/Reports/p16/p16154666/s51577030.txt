 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs. Increased interstitial markings
 are more pronounced on the current exam, suggestive of mild interstitial
 edema. There is a small effusion on the right.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  There is no pneumothorax. Right basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema, small right pleural effusion and right
 basilar atelectasis.
