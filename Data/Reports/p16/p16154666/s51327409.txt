                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diastolic heart failure with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest when compared to the
 prior study show increased lung volumes with decreased pulmonary vascular
 congestion and a reduced cardiac contour, which may be in part due to the
 technique of the study.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.  No
 areas of focal consolidation are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in lung volumes, interstitial edema, and
 apparent heart size.  No pleural effusions. Minimal pulmonary edema.
