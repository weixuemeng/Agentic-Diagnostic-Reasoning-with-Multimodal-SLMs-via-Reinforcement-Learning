                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 right ___- and infrahilar opacities which could relate to edema, infection is
 not excluded.  There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles, could be due to trace pleural
 effusions.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right greater than left perihilar opacities may be due to mild
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  An area of more confluent opacity in the right
 infrahilar region may relate to edema, although underlying consolidation is
 not excluded.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
