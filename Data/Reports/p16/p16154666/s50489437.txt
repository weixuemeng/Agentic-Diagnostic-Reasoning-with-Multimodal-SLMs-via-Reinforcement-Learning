                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New dyspnea on exertion.  Evidence of chronic heart failure and
 interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  No direct chest radiographic comparison available, the
 examination is compared to a CTA examination from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta but without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  At the
 right lung bases, appreciated on both the lateral and the frontal view, there
 is a subtle increase of interstitial structures, notably in the peribronchial
 areas.  Moreover, there is a subtle zone of parenchymal opacity in the right
 upper lobe, supporting the suspicion of the presence of a diffuse interstitial
 process.  CT should be performed to confirm or rule out this suspicion. 
 Severe aortic calcifications.  Severe valvular ring calcifications.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
 
 The information was added to the radiology dashboard.  
 
 Moreover, the referring physician was paged at the time of observation and
 dictation.
