                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Vague opacification is noted in the right middle lobe, likely
 representing pneumonia.  Streaky opacifications are also noted in the left
 lower lobe.  However, given the stable left hemidiaphragm elevation, these may
 represent atelectasis, though a multifocal infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  Mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours are unremarkable.  No
 osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacification likely represents pneumonia. 
 Streaky opacification in left lower lung likely represents atelectasis, though
 a multifocal infectious process cannot be excluded.
