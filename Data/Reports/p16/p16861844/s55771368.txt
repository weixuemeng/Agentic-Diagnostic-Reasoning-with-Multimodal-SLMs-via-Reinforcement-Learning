                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with 2 month history of productive cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta
 is tortuous but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy opacity is seen in the
 retrocardiac region. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.  Gastric lap band is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection is not completely excluded.
