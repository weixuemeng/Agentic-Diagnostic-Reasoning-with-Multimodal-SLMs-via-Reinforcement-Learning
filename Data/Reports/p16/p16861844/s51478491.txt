                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Vague region of new opacification in the right mid lung could be
 pneumonia, though seen only on the frontal view; confirmation and localization
 might be possible with oblique views.  The left lung is clear as is the right
 upper lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  The hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right lower lung pneumonia.  The pneumonia is in a
 similar location to the ___ pneumonia the patient previously had. 
 Given the insult is in the same area as prior, repeat radiographs after
 treatment to document resolution is recommended.
