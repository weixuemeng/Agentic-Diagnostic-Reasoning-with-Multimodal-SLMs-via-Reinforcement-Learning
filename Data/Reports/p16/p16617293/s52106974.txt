                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of aspiration, esophageal food impaction.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The lung volumes remain low and atelectasis are seen at both lung
 bases, both on the lateral and on the frontal view.  However, there is a
 slight increase in transparency of the lung parenchyma as compared to the
 previous exam, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  No new parenchymal
 opacities.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
