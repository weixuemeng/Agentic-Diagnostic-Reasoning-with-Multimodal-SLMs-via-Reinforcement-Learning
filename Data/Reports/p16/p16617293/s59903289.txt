                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decreased breath sounds and concern for heart
 failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There are new right lower lobe and right middle lobe areas of atelectasis,
 chronicity and reason unclear.  Slight right mediastinal shift is unchanged. 
 Right hemidiaphragm elevation is unchanged as well.  Left lung is essentially
 clear as well as the right upper lobe.  No appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle lobe predominantly atelectasis, chronicity undetermined. 
 Otherwise, no abnormality is seen.  Unchanged right mediastinal shift.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with CT chest may be considered.
