                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with fever, concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained on ___ at 11:42 p.m.
 
 The right lower lobe opacity seen on the prior study is a combination of
 consolidation and atelectasis and it is re-demonstrated concerning for
 infection.  Minimal atelectasis in the left lower lung is new.  Upper lungs
 are essentially clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion is noted, although
 small amount of right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
