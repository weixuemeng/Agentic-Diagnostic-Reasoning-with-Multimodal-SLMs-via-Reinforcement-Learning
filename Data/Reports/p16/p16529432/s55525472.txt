 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there
 is no vascular congestion.  There is increased opacification at the left base
 above an elevated hemidiaphragmatic contour.  This most likely represents
 atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
