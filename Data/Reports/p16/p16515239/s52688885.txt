                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and elevated WBC  // eval for
 pneumonia      eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs
 raises the possibility of chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of
 acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Again there is
 apical pleural thickening bilaterally, suggestive of old healed tuberculous
 disease.  Minimal streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base laterally.
