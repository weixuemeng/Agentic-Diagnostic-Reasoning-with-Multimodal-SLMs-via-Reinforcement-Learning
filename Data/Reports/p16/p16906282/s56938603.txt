                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ on CKD and bad diabetes with new
 hypoxia and hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Consolidation in the lower lobes could be
 due to a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis.  No large effusions
 detected.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidations are likely due to a combination of edema and
 atelectasis.  However, the patient should be followed prior radiographs to
 determine that she does not have concurrent pneumonia.
