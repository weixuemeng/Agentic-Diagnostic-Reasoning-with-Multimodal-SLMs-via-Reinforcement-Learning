                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p R supraclavicular nerve block for R arm fistula with O2
 desaturation. Likely has R phrenic nerve block but would like to r/o
 pneumothorax as well. Has hx of pleural effusion/volume overload from CHF and
 renal disease. Takes torsemide at home.  // Rule out pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ catheter has been removed.  Lung volumes appear slightly lower
 compared to the prior study, which exaggerates bronchovascular markings. 
 Increased perihilar opacity on the right may represent worsening vascular
 congestion exaggerated by a low lung volumes, although a superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Dense left
 retrocardiac opacity has improved, likely reflecting resolving atelectasis. 
 There is suggestion of a small layering pleural effusion on the left.  No
 pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 Right hemidiaphragm is newly elevated from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Asymmetrical right perihilar opacity, may represent worsening vascular
 congestion the setting of low lung volumes.  However, superimposed pneumonia
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
 3. No pneumothorax.
 4. New right hemidiaphragm elevation.
