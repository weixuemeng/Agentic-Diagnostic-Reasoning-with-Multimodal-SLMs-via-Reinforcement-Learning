                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with leukocytosis  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An increased right lower lobe airspace opacity is most likely due to
 aspiration given its rapid improvement on the subsequent chest CT.  Asymmetric
 pleural thickening, right greater than left, is present. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart and mediastinum are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe aspiration is favored over pneumonia given the rapid
 improvement on subsequent chest CT.
