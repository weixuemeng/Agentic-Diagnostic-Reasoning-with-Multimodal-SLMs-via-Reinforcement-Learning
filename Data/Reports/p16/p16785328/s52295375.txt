                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left-sided rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  A 1 cm nodular opacity seen in the retrocardiac
 region above the medial margin of the left hemidiaphragm.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is present. Otherwise cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No rib fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of rib fractures. However this study is limited for detection
 of rib fractures and if there is high clinical concern dedicated rib views
 should be obtained.
 
 2.  1 cm nodule projecting over the left lower lobe is potentially calcified
 and could be due to overlying costochondral cartilage. This can be further
 assessed with shallow obliques.
