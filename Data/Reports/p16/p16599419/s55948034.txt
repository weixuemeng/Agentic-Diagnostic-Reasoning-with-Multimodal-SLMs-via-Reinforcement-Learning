                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date and earlier chest x-ray of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pneumothorax has increased in size and is now small to
 moderate in size, with apical visceral line overlying the left fifth posterior
 rib level.  Opacity at the left base has worsened compared to the recent chest
 x-ray and probably represents a combination of pulmonary contusion and
 atelectasis in the setting of recent chest wall trauma on the left with acute
 left-sided rib fractures which have been fully detailed on recent CT torso of
 earlier the same date.  Small left pleural effusion is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small to moderate left pneumothorax has increased since prior
 chest x-ray, but is similar in size since the more recent CT torso of earlier
 the same date when allowances are made for differences in patient positioning.
