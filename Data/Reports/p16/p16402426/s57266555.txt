                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurring fevevers  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lung volumes are slightly low,
 resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in
 mind, there are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia, and no pleural effusions are detected.
