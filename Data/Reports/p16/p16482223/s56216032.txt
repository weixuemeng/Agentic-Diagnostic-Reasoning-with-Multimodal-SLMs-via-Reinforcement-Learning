                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent chest CT
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Bibasilar opacities, left greater
 than right, likely reflect dependant atelectasis, however, pneumonia is
 possible in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  The remainder of the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A subcentimeter dense nodule in the
 right upper lobe corresponds with a calcified granuloma seen on concurrent
 chest CT.  No vascular congestion, edema or pleural effusions are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, probable dependent
 atelectasis, though pneumonia is in the differential in the appropriate
 clinical circumstance.
 2.  Stable right upper lobe calcified granuloma.
