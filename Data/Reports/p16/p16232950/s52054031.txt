                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus.  An orogastric
 tube courses into the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations
 of technique there is no definite abnormality involving cardiac, mediastinal
 or hilar contours.  There is pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures and vague asymmetric opacification of
 the left lung.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base suggest minor
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mainstem bronchus intubation.  Asymmetric opacity and mild leftward
 shift suggesting associated early atelectasis of the left lung.  Low lung
 volumes.
