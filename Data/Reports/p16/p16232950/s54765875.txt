                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Urosepsis, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest is limited due to patient
 rotation.  The endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right internal jugular
 central venous catheter are unchanged.  Left lung is clear aside from mild
 basilar atelectasis.  The right lung base is opacified due to considerable
 atelectasis.  Right middle lobe is not clearly visualized due to patient
 rotation and underlying infectious process cannot be ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged monitoring and support devices with bibasilar
 atelectasis, worse on the right. Recommend repeat study with patient
 symmetrically positioned.
