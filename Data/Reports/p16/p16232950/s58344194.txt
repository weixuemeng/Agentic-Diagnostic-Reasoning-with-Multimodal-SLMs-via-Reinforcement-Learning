                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and sepsis, status post intubation and
 central venous line placement.  Evaluate endotracheal tube position and
 central venous line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Three portable AP radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 first image demonstrates a low position of the endotracheal tube, terminating
 at the level of the carina.  Both subsequent radiographs demonstrate that the
 endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, with its tip terminating appropriately
 6.0 cm above the level of the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter ends within the mid-to-upper right atrium.  The lung volumes are low,
 causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  There is subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm obscures evaluation of the right lung base.  The heart is
 normal in size.  There is widening of the vascular pedicle, likely due to
 supine positioning.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the right atrium. 
 Re-positioning should be considered.  This finding was discussed with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ at 1:41 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study, 2
 minutes after discovery of the finding.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, of uncertain etiology. 
 Considerations included hemidiaphragmatic paralysis or an
 infectious/inflammatory process in the right upper abdominal quandrant. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 Impression point #3 was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:45 a.m.
 via telephone on ___.
