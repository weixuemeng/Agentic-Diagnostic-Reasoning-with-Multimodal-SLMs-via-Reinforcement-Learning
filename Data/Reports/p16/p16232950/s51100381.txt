                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Interval change in nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:55 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows the tip of the NG tube at the

 should be advanced further.  The chest is not completely imaged on this view
 and compared to the prior study, there is no other relevant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of the NG tube in the lower esophagus, should be advanced for
 more appropriate positioning.
