                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY: Fever.  Question pneumonia. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is some fullness to the
 right hilum on the AP view, although not necessarily abnormal.  However, there
 is soft tissue fullness on the lateral view projecting over the anterior hilar
 region. Fissures appear thickened.  There is also some separation between the
 aortic arch and the trachea by about 1 cm.  Indistinct vasculature suggests
 pulmonary venous hypertension.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Moderate anterior osteophytes are present along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and findings suggesting mild fluid overload.
 
 2.  Abnormal hilar contour on the lateral view.  When clinically feasible,
 this appearance could be reassessed with standard PA and lateral views in
 short-term followup or alternatively chest CT could be considered, preferably
 with intravenous contrast if feasible.
