                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 NG tube courses through the mediastinum to terminate in the upper left
 hypochondrium.  NG tube remains in good position, approximately about 6 cm
 above the carina.  The patient is status post left humeral arthroplasty. 
 Severe changes in the right shoulder are noted.
 
 There is pulmonary hyperinflation present.  The lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear.  There is an unchanged dense nodule projected below the right hilum or
 interlobar artery just adjacent to the vertebral column, well demonstrated due
 to the patient's unchanged scoliosis.  With reference to the prior CT, I
 suspect that this represents an unusually steeply entering inferior pulmonary
 vein.  Certainly no mass is identified here.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Little interval change from prior study.  No good evidence of pneumonia or
 acute process.  Support hardware in appropriate position.
