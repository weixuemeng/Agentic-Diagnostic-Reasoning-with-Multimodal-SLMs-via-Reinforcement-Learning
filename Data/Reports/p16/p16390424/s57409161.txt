 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:00 AM
  A right-sided neck catheter crosses the midline toward the left heart.  As no
  duplicated superior vena cava was seen on the recent chest CT, this is
  worrisome for arterial cannulation.  Further worsening of the bilateral and
  diffuse opacities consistent with infection/ARDS.  No pneumothorax.  Small
  pleural effusions not well seen.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
  ___ at 01:47 on ___ by telephone at the time discovered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, intubation, line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:21 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been a new
 insertion of a right central catheter.  The catheter shows an abnormal course
 and crosses the midline over the heart.  As no duplicated superior vena cava
 was documented on the recent CT, this position is worrisome for arterial
 cannulation.
 
 At the time of observation, the findings were immediately reported by
 telephone.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication.  The other
 monitoring and support devices are constant.  There is mild further worsening
 of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.
