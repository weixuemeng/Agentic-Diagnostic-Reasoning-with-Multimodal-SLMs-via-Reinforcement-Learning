                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Chain sutures from prior
 right upper lobe wedge resection are again noted.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis and scarring without focal
 consolidation.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right upper lobe wedge resection.  Low lung volumes with patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis and scarring.
