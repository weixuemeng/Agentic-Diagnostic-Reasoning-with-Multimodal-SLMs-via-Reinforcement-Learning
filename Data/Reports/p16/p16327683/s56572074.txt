                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea and leukocytosis, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains mildly enlarged most likely reflecting cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion should also be considered.  Lungs appear well
 inflated.  Subtle patchy retrocardiac opacity is seen which may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although LLL pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Followup imaging may be helpful if the patient's symptoms persist.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is a suggestion of subtle reticulonodular
 pattern throughout the lungs which may reflect an underlying interstitial
 process, age-related changes or small airways disease. Clinical correlation is
 advised.  No pulmonary edema.  Multiple right-sided healed rib fractures and
 stable thoracolumbar scoliosis.  An IVC filter remains in place.  Layering
 bilateral effusions best appreciated on the lateral projection.
