  A right-sided approach Swan-Ganz catheter terminates proximal to the right
  ventricular outflow tract and should be advanced 4-5 cm for ideal positioning.
  Right-sided PICC is unchanged in position.
  
  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar consolidations are increased from the prior
  examination and likely represent bilateral small pleural effusions and
  adjacent atelectasis however infection should be considered suspected
  clinically.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with systolic CHF (EF ___%, s/p dual chamber ICD
 ___), CAD s/p DES to LAD ___, aortic stenosis s/p AVR, alcohol abuse, HTN,
 HLD, DM2 who presented with cardiogenic shock. PA catheter pulled back by pt
 5cm  // please evaluate PA catheter position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single view at ___ 7:45 PM
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ at 03:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs:  There is a worsening pulmonary edema pattern.  Bibasilar density is
 present which likely represents compressive atelectasis, but underlying
 infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Pleura: Increasing bibasilar pleural effusions are present
 
 Mediastinum: No mediastinal mass is seen on this AP examination.
 
 Heart:  The heart is enlarged.  Pacemaker noted..
 
 Osseous structures: The patient is status post median sternotomy.
 
 Additional findings: The Swan-Ganz catheter is been withdrawn and terminates
 proximal to the the ventricular outflow tract.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema.  The Swan-Ganz catheter is in the right ventricle.
