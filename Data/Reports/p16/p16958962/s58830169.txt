                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:40 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man intubated.  Neck fractures.  Check NG tube and
 possible aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two frontal views of the chest, compared to ___:
 
 ET tube tip is approximately 2 cm from the carina, with the chin elevated.  It
 should be withdrawn 15 mm to give greater clearance and avoid unilateral
 intubation with changing position of the head and neck.  An upper enteric
 drainage tube passes at least as far as the mid stomach, where it probably
 ends.  Moderate cardiomegaly stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has
 improved.  There is no appreciable edema or pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.
