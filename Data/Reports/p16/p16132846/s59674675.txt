 opacification along with a calcified granuloma is unchanged since ___, which is the earliest chest imaging available to us.  There are also
 bibasilar opacities which are not significantly changed from the prior exam,
 and are likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 Stable mild cardiomegaly. There is a moderate amount of free air under the
 right hemidiaphragm which has slightly improved since the prior radiograph. 
 The feeding tube is out of view on this CXR.
