                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  On trach with pulmonary edema, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  Compared to the prior film, AP positioning
 is improved.  Allowing for considerable differences in positioning and
 resolution of the overlying skin folds, again seen is cardiomegaly with
 prominent pulmonary hila, stable or slightly improved, bilateral left greater
 than right effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, probably
 not significantly changed, upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with interstitial edema, probably may also not grossly
 changed.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Right greater than left biapical
 pleural thickening with a calcified granuloma at the right apex is unchanged. 
 On today's film, no definite subdiaphragmatic intra-abdominal air is
 identified.  Presumed G-tube noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Improved positioning, but overall, the findings are similar the prior film.
 
 2) Slight improvement in the degree of cardiomediastinal enlargement.  
 3) Evidence for bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation and CHF with interstitial edema.
