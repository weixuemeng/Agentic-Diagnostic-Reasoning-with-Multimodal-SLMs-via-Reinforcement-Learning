                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased ventilator requirement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___ noon.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Vertical linear lucencies over the right lung are
 thought to reflect skin folds.  This makes it difficult to interpret the areas
 of vertical opacity over the right lung which might also represent artifact
 due to skin folds.  Tracheostomy tube again seen.  As before, there is
 moderately severe cardiomegaly, with increased retrocardiac density consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small-to-moderate
 layering left effusion.  Also again seen is dense opacity at the right lung
 apex, with an associated nodular calcification, question calcified granuloma. 
 Also unchanged is atelectasis and a small effusion at the right lung base. 
 The degree of opacity at the right base may be slightly increased.  A small
 amount of intra-abdominal air is again noted, more diffuse.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Possible slight worsening of opacity at the right lung base.  
 2) Vertical opacities along the right lung most likely represent artifact due
 to skin folds.  If clinically indicated, a repeat view with less rotation and
 attention to potential skin fold could help for additional assessment of the
 right lung.  
 3) Otherwise, allowing for positioning, I doubt significant interval change.  
 4) Some plethora at the left lung apex is similar to the prior film.
 Otherwise, no definite increase in CHF findings.
