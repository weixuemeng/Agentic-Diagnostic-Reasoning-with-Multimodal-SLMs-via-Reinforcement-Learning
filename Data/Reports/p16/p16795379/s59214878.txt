                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Unsteadiness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified.  Slight prominence
 and indistinctness of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Aortic calcifications are seen.

 edema.  Hyperinflated lungs.
