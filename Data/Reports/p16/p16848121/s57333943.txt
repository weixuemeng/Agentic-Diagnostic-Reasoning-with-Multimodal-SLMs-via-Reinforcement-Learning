                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever of unknown origin.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line has been removed.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable.  Lungs are clear with interval resolution of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated
 except for minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus on the lateral
 view, most likely reflecting lobulation of the diaphragm and unlikely to
 reflect pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
