                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease, pre-renal transplantation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for nodular opacity projecting over the right lung base, most likely
 representing right nipple.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Repeated radiograph with nipple markers is recommended.
