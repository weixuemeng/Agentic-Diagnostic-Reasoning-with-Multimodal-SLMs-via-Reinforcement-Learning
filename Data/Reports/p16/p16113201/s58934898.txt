                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:28 A.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS.  ET tube readjusted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:56 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is between 4 and 5 cm from the carina, in
 standard location following repositioning.  Widespread, considerable bilateral
 pulmonary consolidation is undoubtedly exaggerated by overlying soft tissue,
 but has worsened on the right since the previous examination, and failed to
 improve on the left.  The right lower lobe is now largely airless.  Large
 cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess because of patient rotation.  No
 pneumothorax.  Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.
