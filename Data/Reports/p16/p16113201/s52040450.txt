                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The exam is limited by the body habitus of the patient.
 
 ET tube ends 8.9 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line is in upper SVC.  NG
 tube ends below the diaphragm.  Patient has right lower lobe and right middle
 lobe collapse which is unchanged since ___.  However, there is
 more air bronchogram associated to it and increased left lower lung opacities
 compared to ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged with possible
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The exam is limited by the body habitus of the patient, but there is increased
 air bronchogram in the chronic right lower lung collapse and increased left
 lower lung consolidation.  This is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration. 
 This was discussed with the MICU team.
