                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain with
 left-sided vibrating radiating to left arm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Soft tissue
 density is seen in the anterior clear space on the lateral view which is due
 to patient positioning, though anterior soft tissue process cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  No overt edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible soft tissue density in what should be the anterior clear
 space on the lateral view, could relate to patient positioning, however,
 underlying soft tissue not excluded and suggest further evaluation with
 nonurgent chest CT.
