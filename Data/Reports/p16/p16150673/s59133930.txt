                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is indistinct upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
 vascularity and perihilar fullness most suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. 
 In addition, there are suspected moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  In
 that setting, associated suspected bibasilar opacities can probably be
 attributed to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting congestive heart failure with pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
