                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with an upper GI bleed.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is likely within normal limits, although the left
 contour is somewhat obscured by a large retrocardiac rounded mass with lucency
 within it, most compatible with a large hiatal hernia.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. 
 Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia, but no acute cardiopulmonary process and no
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
