 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  There is a known large left hiatal hernia that
 causes massive elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and moderate atelectasis at
 the left lung bases.  No other parenchymal abnormalities, notably no pneumonia
 is seen on the current image.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 without pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  No larger pleural effusions.
