                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  Left upper lobe
 volume loss is present, manifested by upward retraction of the left hilum, and
 accompanied by asymmetrical left apical thickening.  Lungs and pleural
 surfaces are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe volume loss with associated asymmetrical left
 apical thickening, likely the sequela of previous infection in the absence of
 previous history of radiation therapy.  
 
 Direct comparison to any outside radiographs would be helpful to determine
 retrospective stability of this appearance.  If unavailable, short-term
 followup radiographs in three to six months may be helpful to confirm
 stability.
