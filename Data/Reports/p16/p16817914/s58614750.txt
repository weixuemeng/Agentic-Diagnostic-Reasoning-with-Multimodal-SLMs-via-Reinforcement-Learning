                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Multifocal diffuse lung opacities worse in the lower lobes have improved. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. 
 There are no new discrete lung opacities.  Cardiomediastinum is unchanged. 
 Some of the remaining opacities have nodular appearance in the left upper
 lobe, continued followup is recommended until complete resolution.
