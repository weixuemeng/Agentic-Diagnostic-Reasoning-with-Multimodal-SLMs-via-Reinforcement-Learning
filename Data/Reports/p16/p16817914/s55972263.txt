 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia with blood transfusion and
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided PIC line tip is at mid SVC.  Bilateral, diffuse, airspace and
 nodular opacities have improved since ___. Persisting opacities
 reflect residual edema, however, concurrent infection cannot be ruled out. No
 new discrete opacity.  Bilateral pleural effusions, if any, are small.  Top
 normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
