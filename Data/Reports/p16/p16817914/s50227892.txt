                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of COPD and
 dyspnea and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study there has been interval improvement of the widespread
 parenchymal opacities with still present right lower lung opacity and left
 basal opacity but substantially improved since the prior study.  There is no
 evidence of new consolidations.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 
 Note is made that given the widespread preexisting abnormalities chest
 radiograph is not the most sensitive option to diagnose new infectious process
 and if clinically warranted, chest CT might be considered.
