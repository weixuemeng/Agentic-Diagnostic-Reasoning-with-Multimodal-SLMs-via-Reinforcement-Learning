                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multifocal pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right subclavian central line is present, the tip terminates at the SVC/RA
 junction.  There is cardiomegaly.  There are opacities in both lungs and
 increased retrocardiac density.  In appropriate clinical setting, this could
 reflect CHF with a developing alveolar component.  Radiographically, the
 differential would include other alveolar processes including pneumonia.  No
 gross effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral alveolar opacities.  This could reflect multifocal
 pneumonia with associated pulmonary edema.
