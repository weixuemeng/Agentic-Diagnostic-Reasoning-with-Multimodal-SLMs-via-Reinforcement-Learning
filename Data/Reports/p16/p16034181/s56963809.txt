                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CLL, presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is slight increase in interstitial markings involving the
 right lung, particularly the right lung base, to a lesser extent the left lung
 base which may be due to chronic lung disease; however, atypical infection is
 not excluded.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Aortic knob
 calcification is again seen.  Mediastinal contours are relatively stable.
