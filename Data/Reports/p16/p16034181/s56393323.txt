                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:30 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement have improved substantially
 since ___ and pleural effusions have nearly resolved.  Residual
 consolidation in both lower lobes is more pronounced than it was on ___
 and therefore might well be pneumonia.  Extent of central adenopathy is
 underestimated by these conventional radiographs.  Calcified pleural plaques
 are visible to some extent.  Heart is normal size.  Emphysema distorts
 vascular pattern in the upper lobes.
 
 Moderate size hiatus hernia accounts for fluid collection in the lower midline
 mediastinum.
