                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with concern for intestinal perforation,
 upright imaging to evaluate for free air.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There are multiple loops of dilated bowel.  No free intraperitoneal air is
 seen.  Lung volumes remain low with streaky opacities at both bases likely
 representing bibasilar patchy atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  The nasogastric tube is coiled within the distal
 esophagus, and re-positioning would be advised.  On a subsequent abdominal
 plain film performed at ___, the nasogastric tube does course below the
 diaphragm, and the tip projects over the stomach.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Clips in the right axilla suggest prior axillary node dissection.  Old
 right-sided posterolateral rib fractures are seen.
